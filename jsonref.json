Valeska previously worked as a messenger for David Miscavige and claims she had a close relationship with his wife Shelly Miscavige (right)  57, who has not been seen in public since 2006          Valeska claims members were not allowed to look at Tom Cruise in the eye, talk to him, and had to address him as \u0027sir\u0027 when he came around . Above he is pictured in 2008 with Katie Holmes and David Miscavige          Valeska was 18 years old when she was ordered to work aboard the Freewinds ship, which is used by top management and members who pay huge sums to live onboard for weeks at a time completing high-level Scientology courses Valeska, who was 18 at the time, says she spent the next 12 years on the ship \u0027against her will.\u0027 However, in a statement to DailyMail.com, the Church of Scientology denied that Jaquier\u0027s death was a suicide and said his death had \u0027no bearing\u0027 on Valeska being transferred to Freewinds. In a death certificate provided by the church to DailyMail.com, Jaquier\u0027s cause of death was determined to be \u0027natural\u0027 from his history of heart disease.They also claim he was worth about $1.2m at the time of his death.   \u0027Ms. Paris served as a crew member aboard the Freewinds religious retreat as a volunteer religious worker from September 1996 to December 2007. She was an adult and there of her own free will as part of her religious commitment to the Church of Scientology,\u0027 a spokesperson for the church said. Valeska says that during her first six months on the ship she was working on decks and in the engine room before being moved to the restaurant.\u0027When I was first on the ship, I had my passport seized, no days off for six months, no privileges, phone calls were not allowed. I was told by the captain I was never getting off the ship,\u0027 she claims.\u0027The ship was full of blue asbestos, every night we\u0027d get on our knees, we\u0027d be picking chunks of blue asbestos with our bare hands, to this day, I have this cough which won\u0027t go away. I finally got off decks and worked in the restaurant.\u0027 She recalls one of the busiest times on the ship was during the annual Maiden Voyage, a special week-long event which saw many church VIPs come aboard the Freewinds.\u0027We worked many, many late nights. Before Maiden Voyage, we\u0027d be working until 4 a.m., and during it, we wouldn\u0027t be sleeping at all. I would fall asleep on the toilet. \u0027If you have so little sleep, you lose your memory, I\u0027d forget what people wanted to drink or even ordered to eat. During this time, I would be in COB\u0027s dining room, serving the food, and cleaning up. \u0027When he saw me on my first Maiden Voyage, he called me over and said: I forgot I\u0027d sent you here, how do you like it? and I said: No, I really didn\u0027t like it at first, but now I\u0027m getting used to it.\u0027\u0027\u0027He couldn\u0027t believe it, and said: Why don\u0027t you like it?\u0027          Valeska said she once broke the rules and had to serve Tom Cruise and then-girlfriend Penelope Cruz on Freewinds in 2003.  She claims females were forbidden by Miscavige from serving Cruise because, \u0027He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027          Valeska was a second-generation Scientologist, starting off as a cadet at its headquarters in Saint Hill, England, she then signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org, even though she was only 14. She later moved to Clearwater, Florida, where the church is basedAfter Maiden Voyage in 2003, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz came aboard the ship and crew members were expected to follow a strict set of rules while tending to them, she claims.  \u0027They\u0027d spend all their time ing and playing around on a $2,000-a-day yacht with Miscavige, meanwhile, we\u0027d be working under horrific conditions.\u0027We were shown pictures of Tom, Penelope and all his entourage so we knew who they all were. \u0027We were told not to tell anyone they were coming, otherwise you\u0027d be sent to the RPF. You can\u0027t look at him in the eye, you can\u0027t talk to him, address him as sir, and stay the f*** out of his way.\u0027We then found out that he was coming on the ship tomorrow, so COB was asking who was going to serve him. He ended up picking a man as he said no woman is allowed to serve him. \u0027He said, and this is the God\u0027s honest truth, right in front of me and two other women: He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027The next morning, Tom had his breakfast while COB was sleeping - he was in bed every day until midday - and the guy who was meant to serve him overslept, so I ended up serving him. \u0027He had this egg white omelette with a bunch of vegetables. Penelope came in a white dress and she had a special diet as well. \u0027She was very nice, super calm, wearing no make up, laid back, but he was very hyper. Tom and COB only drank Smart Water, all meals were specially made. I also served Penelope for dinner.\u0027Any couples not married who came on the ship were not allowed to share a cabin, but Tom was allowed a room with her. Sea Org members were angry, there was hostility about that. \u0027Every night they\u0027d watch a movie in the cinema room. He was very much in love with Penelope and happy. Penelope was getting audited at the time in 2003, she was doing Scientology for sure. When she left the Church, the auditor got in trouble.\u0027          Valeska signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org at 14 The following year, after he split from Cruz, the Mission Impossible actor came back right after Maiden Voyage and it was his 42nd birthday, but Valeska was not invited. Miscavige made sure it was a night to be remembered. Cringe-worthy YouTube clips have surfaced from the event showing Cruise, now 56, singing and dancing to the band, then proclaiming: \u0027This is incredible... It\u0027s the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean: ever!\u0027Valeska says: \u0027The Starlight Cabaret, which is the entertainment and event space on the ship, was decorated for Tom\u0027s birthday, it looked ridiculous, there was every poster of every movie he\u0027d ever done, apart from ones with Nicole Kidman. She was considered a Suppressive Person. No Nicole posters allowed anywhere. \u0027They also did a concert and all the songs were from movies he\u0027d been in except Nicole ones. They flew his favorite Chinese chef to cook for him, this was all paid for by Scientology.\u0027I was one of the only people on the ship who was not allowed to go to his birthday, as I had the audacity to have a cold sore, I was so run down,\u0027 she says. From then on, she claims, she was taken off the ship for every Maiden Voyage. \u0027I got put in isolation, had an ethics interview, and security check to find out what my evil intentions were to COB and Shelly: Do you have an evil purpose to COB? Do you want to do something bad to him? They do this line of questioning until they find out why I am evil to them. And when you come up with nothing you get yelled at and told to confront your evil intentions,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was all a blessing in disguise, as I can\u0027t dance, and everyone was ordered to dance. There were three girls, who did dance, and then accused of flirting with him, so they were locked in a room, told to write up their crimes for being interesting in front of Tom Cruise.    Valeska says she considered Shelly (pictured left, and right, with Leah Remini) a \u0027mother figure\u0027 who took her under her wing           This is the Scientology base in Twin Peaks, California, where Shelly is believed to live          Valeska doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested and thinks she is not there against her will\u0027The only Scientology celebrity that COB likes is Tom Cruise, the others are all below him. Tom Cruise would call him on the phone, they\u0027d be on the phone all the time,\u0027 she claims.       Although Valeska feared Miscavige, she claims she had a close relationship with his wife, Shelly Miscavige, who has not been seen in public in more than a decade. \u0027But my relationship with Shelly was great, she kept an eye on me, and was keen for me to keep up with my education. Scientology didn\u0027t care, and we were never sent to school as Sea Org members,\u0027 she claims.  Valeska says Shelly was like a \u0027mother figure\u0027 to her and she kept in touch with her through letters even after she was sent away on Freewinds. \u0027We wrote letters for years, she took me under her wing. When I was first engaged to a guy, she wrote two pages demanding to know everything. From the age of 15 to 25, for ten years we would write back and forth,\u0027 she says.August marked the 12-year anniversary since Shelly was last seen in public. Former church members have speculated that she has been at a secret Scientology base called Twin Peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains since 2006.Valeska, however, has a different theory and doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested.\u0027She\u0027s not there against her will, the treatment she\u0027ll be getting is a lot better than most would receive. She\u0027s living in the mountains and, yes, sure, she\u0027s under security watch and it won\u0027t be like before, as she was living like a queen,\u0027 she says.\u0027Yet, it\u0027s not like she\u0027ll be in RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) conditions. Imagine his wife going into the RPF, she knows more than anyone about COB\u0027s secrets, he is going to have to keep her happy.\u0027The church has long denied any rumors suggesting Shelly is missing and have insisted that she is devoting her time to the work of the Church of Scientology.Valeska says she used to see Shelly on the ship when she came aboard for Maiden Voyage and the two kept in touch through written correspondence about their personal lives, including Valeska\u0027s first marriage. Weddings were common among Sea Org members and most married as teens and twenty-somethings since sexual contact is not allowed before marriage. \u0027When I was on the ship, I married a guy called Roberto, I was only 20. Shelly was pleased, she told me: Good, you have someone to look after you, I don\u0027t need to do it. She wanted to see all the photos from my wedding album,\u0027 she says.          Valeska eventually fled the church after completing RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) in Australia. She now lives with her husband and three kids - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, in Brisbane           An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad  The negative publicity rocked the church and Miscavige.\u0027I would hear him scream at the top of his lungs while I was working in the kitchen next to the execs room, I would be shaking, it was so scary. \u0027When Lisa McPherson happened, he changed. All of the execs he was friends with, that all disappeared. His circle went even smaller,\u0027 she alleges.Shelly\u0027s usually strong relationship with her husband began to falter - he dismissed the whole of his board of executives in favor of younger, more eager to please, dedicated Sea Org members, such as Lou Stuckenbrock, for whom he created the position \u0027COB Communicator\u0027.\u0027Shelly became more and more stressed out. COB would be in the dining room with his Communicator Lou and she would eat afterwards,\u0027 Valeska claims.\u0027In her letters she would never say anything, but she was writing less and less, I got the sense she was more stressed. She wasn\u0027t perfect, but she stood by COB for years, and I never saw them argue, but I always saw that he was very close with Lou.\u0027In 2005, he said in a meeting that Shelly had been taken off his lines, but he wasn\u0027t going to orce her, he was way too qualified to ever marry any other Sea Org member. She was extremely dedicated to him. His words were: She messed up his communication lines.\u0027 Shelly has since retreated from public life once a prominent member of the church, she was even absent at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u0027s wedding in 2006.In 2013, Hollywood actress and famous Church defector Leah Remini filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department for Shelly. Police eventually said that they had interviewed Shelly and confirmed she wasn\u0027t being held against her will and didn\u0027t want to make any public statement.  Valeska\u0027s correspondence with Shelly came to a stop after she left. She says her time at the church worsened in 2007, after she was sent to England \u0027on a mission\u0027 during Maiden Voyage.Only days into it, Valeska got into hot water for daring to speak to a married man and she was ordered back to the Freewinds and sent to the engine room. After all this treatment, Valeska was suicidal and desperate to get out.\u0027In my mind, I was either going to end it or get off that ship,\u0027 she adds. But Valeska also had no skills for the real world, her brother Raphael, 36, and father Jean, 66, were and still are in the church today, she\u0027d never be allowed to see them again if she absconded.She\u0027d also \u0027disconnected\u0027 from her mother Ariane and younger sister Melissa, 38, 14 years ago when they left the Church.\u0027They wouldn\u0027t let me off this ship. I had served COB and knew their dirty little secrets. It was still hard to leave, I\u0027d been in the Sea Org since 14, I had no education, no money, never had a bank account, I had no idea how to live in the real world.  \u0027I\u0027d lose my brother and father instantly, I didn\u0027t know if my mom or sister would reconnect or where they lived. I\u0027d been indoctrinated that Scientology is life,\u0027 she says.Valeska was sent to the RPF in Australia, in the hope that it would \u0027rehabilitate\u0027 her. During this time, she met Chris Guider, a former rugby league legend in Australia who gave it all up in the 80s for Scientology.\u0027After graduating the RPF, they started making my life hell again. They were threatening to send me back to the ship, but I\u0027d already decided I would never, ever go back to that place again,\u0027 she says.\u0027When we finally got free, we had no one to judge us, I could watch TV when I wanted to, I had a normal room that wasn\u0027t a dormitory, I felt so much freedom. That\u0027s when I realized that Scientology was, in a nutshell, s**t.\u0027I hadn\u0027t seen my mom and sister for ages. I hadn\u0027t seen my mom for so long that when I first saw her, I went up to the wrong person. We didn\u0027t recognize each other. \u0027My dad sent me a text saying he was going to disconnect from me for talking to my mom and sister, this was at the same time as I was eight months pregnant with my first child.\u0027Today, Chris and Valeska now live happily in Brisbane and have three children - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, three - but still live under the shadow of Scientology\u0027s disconnection policy.Valeska said: \u0027I have three children who\u0027ve never met their grandfather. I haven\u0027t spoken to my brother since 2010. My family is destroyed. But we got out and we\u0027re having a good life. Hopefully my dad and brother will wake up one day, and my door will always be open for them.\u0027In a statement to DailyMail.com the church said: \u0027What has been said about us all too often—as is the case here—is pure propaganda. It is inaccurate and intentionally avoids showing who Scientologists really are and what we do. \u0027Propagandists look to capitalize on the growing curiosity about Scientology. They have manufactured controversies where there are none while refusing to show the Church, its organizations, its humanitarian programs as well as its unprecedented growth in Churches worldwide.

Lidl then tweeted a tongue-in-cheek advert for an £89 Yamaha keyboardThe German supermarket tweeted: \u0027Just because you don\u0027t have £872 to spend on a piano, doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be the next Elton\u0027, alongside a picture of an £89.99 Yamaha keyboard.The picture is also captioned \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit funny...\u0027 Twitter users were quick to praise the witty response, calling it a \u0027masterstroke\u0027 while one user said \u0027give your marketing manager a rise\u0027.The official John Lewis account then tweeted Lidl a link to its £15 children\u0027s piano with the message: \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit cheaper\u0027.One wag replied to both saying: \u0027Do you pair want to leave this argument till the weekend. I’ve heard Saturday nights all right for fighting\u0027 - a joke linked to another of Sir Elton\u0027s big hits.                        Five actors aged between four and 50 were used to play Sir Elton, using prosthetics, CGI and help from the star and his husband David Furnish to ensure they had the same mannerisms and piano playing style.Viewers are taken back through key moments in his life with scenes of the star on stadium tours, travelling on a private jet, recording Your Song, playing the piano in a local pub and performing in a school recital. It ends with Sir Elton - then little Reg Dwight - running down the stairs on Christmas morning to see his grandmother Ivy and his mother, who brought him up together because his father, Stanley, was largely absent.John Lewis has said the advert is \u0027inspired by real events\u0027 but admits the finale involves \u0027some creativity\u0027 because the singer was never gifted a piano at Christmas, but he had learned to play at his grandmother\u0027s house - and denied claims they paid him £5million to take part. It is also the second of the retailer\u0027s Christmas ads to feature Your Song after singer Ellie Goulding recorded a cover for the 2010 campaign. The  nod to Elton\u0027s mother and the influence on his career comes almost a year after her death last December.Two years before she passed away the star found the courage to apologise to her after a nearly nine-year feud that culminated in her inviting an Elton John impersonator to perform at her 90th birthday party because she missed him so much.Elton severed all contact with her after a catastrophic argument where she blamed Elton\u0027s husband, David Furnish, for turning him against her.She was also upset the Candle In The Wind singer demanded she cut all ties with her longtime friends Bob Halley and John Reid, who had both been fired from his entourage after decades working for him.But he later sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died last year Elton spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September this year rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted.

We are very, very proud. He beat more than 1,000 other boys and it is great for our small school because a lot of the big London agencies often get these roles.\u0027You don\u0027t get a bigger advert than the John Lewis Christmas ad so this could be a stepping stone to big things for Freddie\u0027.Ms Morgan added she expected the other pupils to be very excited about the advert but said Freddie had not been affected much by the exposure.She added: \u0027At his age, we try to teach them some improvisation, script work and try to get their imaginations going.\u0027We have a lot of talented children but since Freddie arrived we all said how confident, bubbly he was and how much of a spark he had.\u0027The school also confirmed Freddie would be watching tonight\u0027s first airing of the advert on ITV1 at 9.15pm with his family and it would be filming the moment to share with the public.Meanwhile O\u0027Brien, who plays Sarah in Coronation Street, added: \u0027I\u0027m so proud I could pop.\u0027   \u0027It\u0027s just one big plug for Elton!\u0027 John Lewis ides fans with \u0027not very Christmassy\u0027 festive advert as retailer is accused of \u0027selling out\u0027 by promoting singer\u0027s farewell tour and Rocketman film biopic Fans of the John Lewis Christmas advert are split today over the decision to have millionaire Sir Elton John at its heart.Critics have called the retailer\u0027s 2018 campaign a \u0027sell out\u0027 and a \u0027plug\u0027 for the star\u0027s farewell tour and his Rocketman biopic starring Taron Egerton, which is due for release next year.But others including stars James Corden and Susanna Reid have praised it with some fans claiming it is the retailer\u0027s \u0027best ever\u0027 Christmas commercial.Many said its message that one present can change a life reduced them to tears.   Some fans loved it - and saw it as a happy distraction from the Brexit chaos consuming the UK - with many crying through itThe £7million advert tells the tear-jerking story of his rise to fame and fortune from humble beginnings in Pinner, north London, where he was brought up by his mother Sheila and grandmother Rita.It ends with a four-year-old Elton - then Reg Dwight - unwrapping his first piano on Christmas Day in 1951 then cuts back to the present say showing the emotional 71-year-old playing the same instrument in front of the tree.It is followed by the slogan: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027 and the retailer has today started marketing pianos for £800 - the first time it has sold them for decades.Twitter went wild when it was released this morning - but it has split opinion.@mollytomkinss said: \u0027I feel truly sorry for anyone who can\u0027t understand the deeper meaning of the #JohnLewisChristmasAd this year.

Best ad since the penguins\u0027.   Elton John faces backlash for featuring his mother in John Lewis Christmas ad despite arguing with her for years           Sir Elton, pictured with his mother Sheila  after being knighted in 1998, had a series of damaging rows with her but they reconciled just before she diedSir Elton John healed the long and painful rift with his mother Sheila five months before her death last December  - but he has faced a backlash for featuring their relationship in the John Lewis Christmas advert released today.The star, 71, had been estranged from Mrs Farebrother for around nine years until May 2017 following rows over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish.Mrs Farebrother had encouraged her son to play piano from the age of three and was a constant throughout the majority of his extraordinary career.But their relationship faltered when she was in her 80s and she said two years ago her son \u0027hated\u0027 her after a series of bitter public rows.When she turned ninety she even invited an Elton John lookalike to perform because she missed him so much Despite their reconciliation last year some viewers of the John Lewis ad said it was wrong to put their sometimes rocky relationship at its heart.One fan said while watching today\u0027s advert: \u0027All I could think was: didn\u0027t Elton John famously cut his mum out of his life for years?\u0027 Another said: \u0027Nice ad for, erm... Elton John. Didn’t he refuse to speak to his mother for years? Nice that he appreciated her eventually\u0027, while one critic tweeted: \u0027Remember the time that Elton John’s mum hired an Elton John lookalike to play at her party? That didn’t make the cut into that ad\u0027.But others saw the other side and said: \u0027Such an emotional journey, so gripping, so true to life for so many people and heartfelt especially after @eltonofficial losing his Mother. Well done John Lewis this year!\u0027.Another added: \u0027I was quite moved by #JohnLewisChristmasAd. The power of music and a mother\u0027s love combined. Lovely\u0027.Mother and son\u0027s relationship appeared hit rock bottom in 2016, two years after he married Mr Furnish. Sheila had been a witness at their civil partnership in 2005.Sir Elton said: \u0027I don’t miss her. When she says things in the press, like, “I haven’t spoken to Elton since he married that f****** a****** David Furnish”. That was pretty hard to take\u0027.He added: \u0027I don’t hate my mother. I look after her but I don’t want her in my life.’But they made up fully around six months before she died last year, shortly after he was hospitalised for 12 days, including two nights in intensive care, after picking up a serious infection while touring South America.In May 2017 he confirmed they were close again after he shared a throwback picture on Twitter to celebrate reconnecting with Mrs Farebrother on America\u0027s Mother\u0027s Day with the message: \u0027So happy we are back in touch. Love, Elton.\u0027Mother and son fell out in 2008 after she allegedly refused his request not to talk to two of their oldest friends.          Sheila and Elton at the height of his fame in 1976 - she has been credited for being a driving force behind his career          1947: Elton John is born Reginald Dwight on March 25 to father Stanley and mother Sheila. As he grew up his father was largely absent and his mum encouraged him to play the piano from the age of three.His parents orce and Sheila remarries his stepfather John, and the couple encourage him to write songs and get him a job as a pub pianist age 15. She remained a strong and constant support during his long career. 2008: Mother and son fall out after a row over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish\u0027s influence on his career2015: Mrs Farebrother said that her son \u0027hated\u0027 her and gets an an Elton John impersonator at her 90th birthday party. He then sends a bunch of white orchids - his first contact for seven years. May 2017: He posts a US mother\u0027s day message saying he is \u0027happy they\u0027re in touch\u0027 - confirming they had reconciled their differences.December 4, 2017: Sheila Farebrother dies aged 92.                                                    This was further inflamed when she claimed that Elton never told her she had become a grandmother when boys Elijah and Zachary were born.In 2015 she told the Daily Mail that her son had called out of the blue and ordered her to cut off all contact with Bob Halley - Sir Elton\u0027s driver turned personal assistant, who he had fired after more than 30 years of service - and John Reid, with whom he had fallen out.Mrs Farebrother, who lived in a bungalow on the South Coast, said: \u0027I told him: \u0027I\u0027m not about to do that and drop them. Bob is like a son to me. He has always been marvellous to me and he lives nearby and keeps an eye on me\u0027.\u0027She said Sir Elton flew into an expletive-filled rage, adding: \u0027To my utter amazement, he told me he hated me.\u0027And he banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!\u0027She is said to have told him during the row: \u0027I said to him, And you think more of that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.\u0027During that period, however, it is understood Sir Elton continued to support Sheila financially and to provide a roof over her head, despite all that has passed between them.He is also said to have paid £30,00 for her double hip replacement.At one point she filled the void left by her son with a tribute act to the pop star.Sheila Farebrother hired him to provide the entertainment at her 90th birthday in March 2015 and would send emails to Mr Bacon, who himself described their link as \u0027quite surreal\u0027.Prompted by the milestone birthday, Sir Elton got in touch with his mother for the first time in seven years, sending her white orchids.They then continued to work on their relationship until their reconciliation was properly confirmed by Sir Elton in May 2017.The star last saw her a week before she died.When it was announced on December 4 last year he said he was in \u0027complete shock\u0027.He also posted a photograph of them together in happier times and wrote on Instagram: \u0027So sad to say that my mother passed away this morning. I only saw her last Monday and I am in shock. Travel safe Mum. Thank-you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton\u0027.The singer says he has been spurred on to shower his sons with affection because he received none from his own father.Elton took a swipe at his late father Stanley Dwight while giving a speech in which he said a lack of love had led him to drink and drugs.He said recently: \u0027I never stop telling them I love them, and they never stop telling me they love me\u0027.          Elton John, then 24, at home with his mother Theresa and stepfather Fred in 1971, and the couple were his rock for many years but his own father Stanley was largely absent      John Lewis\u0027 2017 Christmas advert has left viewers in tears over a mischievous and flatulent monster called Moz and  his relationship with a seven-year-old soulmate - with fans comparing it to Disney\u0027s much-loved Monsters Inc.The giant furry monster with a bulbous nose, wonky teeth and a love of snoring, jumps out from under the bed every night to play with companion Joe in a festive tale making many  laugh and cry.The little boy, aged 7, who is played by young twin brothers from London named Ethan and Tobias, is initially frightened after seeing a pair of enormous eyes peering from the dark under his bed.But the two unlikely friends are shown sharing games, playing piggyback and Scalextric in his bedroom – all without mum, dad, or older sister finding out.Moz then leaves his friend as he realises the little boy needs to grow up without him and wraps a farewell gift for him under the Christmas tree - a nightlight to help him sleep.Elbow performed The Beatles\u0027 Abbey Road masterpiece Golden Slumbers as the soundtrack.2016 Last year\u0027s star was Buster the Boxer and his trampoline antics.John Lewis said the advert where the dog, played by five-year-old Biff, beats a young girl to her new toy is their attempt to cheer up Britain after a \u0027tough year\u0027.The advert told the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to jump.Set to a cover version of \u0027One Day I\u0027ll Fly Away\u0027, her mother and father buy her a trampoline, toiling while she sleeps to build it before hiding it in the garden to surprise her with on Christmas Day. As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room.

Above he is pictured in 2008 with Katie Holmes and David Miscavige          Valeska was 18 years old when she was ordered to work aboard the Freewinds ship, which is used by top management and members who pay huge sums to live onboard for weeks at a time completing high-level Scientology courses Valeska, who was 18 at the time, says she spent the next 12 years on the ship \u0027against her will.\u0027 However, in a statement to DailyMail.com, the Church of Scientology denied that Jaquier\u0027s death was a suicide and said his death had \u0027no bearing\u0027 on Valeska being transferred to Freewinds. In a death certificate provided by the church to DailyMail.com, Jaquier\u0027s cause of death was determined to be \u0027natural\u0027 from his history of heart disease.They also claim he was worth about $1.2m at the time of his death.   \u0027Ms. Paris served as a crew member aboard the Freewinds religious retreat as a volunteer religious worker from September 1996 to December 2007. She was an adult and there of her own free will as part of her religious commitment to the Church of Scientology,\u0027 a spokesperson for the church said. Valeska says that during her first six months on the ship she was working on decks and in the engine room before being moved to the restaurant.\u0027When I was first on the ship, I had my passport seized, no days off for six months, no privileges, phone calls were not allowed. I was told by the captain I was never getting off the ship,\u0027 she claims.\u0027The ship was full of blue asbestos, every night we\u0027d get on our knees, we\u0027d be picking chunks of blue asbestos with our bare hands, to this day, I have this cough which won\u0027t go away. I finally got off decks and worked in the restaurant.\u0027 She recalls one of the busiest times on the ship was during the annual Maiden Voyage, a special week-long event which saw many church VIPs come aboard the Freewinds.\u0027We worked many, many late nights. Before Maiden Voyage, we\u0027d be working until 4 a.m., and during it, we wouldn\u0027t be sleeping at all. I would fall asleep on the toilet. \u0027If you have so little sleep, you lose your memory, I\u0027d forget what people wanted to drink or even ordered to eat. During this time, I would be in COB\u0027s dining room, serving the food, and cleaning up. \u0027When he saw me on my first Maiden Voyage, he called me over and said: I forgot I\u0027d sent you here, how do you like it? and I said: No, I really didn\u0027t like it at first, but now I\u0027m getting used to it.\u0027\u0027\u0027He couldn\u0027t believe it, and said: Why don\u0027t you like it?\u0027          Valeska said she once broke the rules and had to serve Tom Cruise and then-girlfriend Penelope Cruz on Freewinds in 2003.  She claims females were forbidden by Miscavige from serving Cruise because, \u0027He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027          Valeska was a second-generation Scientologist, starting off as a cadet at its headquarters in Saint Hill, England, she then signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org, even though she was only 14. She later moved to Clearwater, Florida, where the church is basedAfter Maiden Voyage in 2003, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz came aboard the ship and crew members were expected to follow a strict set of rules while tending to them, she claims.  \u0027They\u0027d spend all their time ing and playing around on a $2,000-a-day yacht with Miscavige, meanwhile, we\u0027d be working under horrific conditions.\u0027We were shown pictures of Tom, Penelope and all his entourage so we knew who they all were. \u0027We were told not to tell anyone they were coming, otherwise you\u0027d be sent to the RPF. You can\u0027t look at him in the eye, you can\u0027t talk to him, address him as sir, and stay the f*** out of his way.\u0027We then found out that he was coming on the ship tomorrow, so COB was asking who was going to serve him. He ended up picking a man as he said no woman is allowed to serve him. \u0027He said, and this is the God\u0027s honest truth, right in front of me and two other women: He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027The next morning, Tom had his breakfast while COB was sleeping - he was in bed every day until midday - and the guy who was meant to serve him overslept, so I ended up serving him. \u0027He had this egg white omelette with a bunch of vegetables. Penelope came in a white dress and she had a special diet as well. \u0027She was very nice, super calm, wearing no make up, laid back, but he was very hyper. Tom and COB only drank Smart Water, all meals were specially made. I also served Penelope for dinner.\u0027Any couples not married who came on the ship were not allowed to share a cabin, but Tom was allowed a room with her. Sea Org members were angry, there was hostility about that. \u0027Every night they\u0027d watch a movie in the cinema room. He was very much in love with Penelope and happy. Penelope was getting audited at the time in 2003, she was doing Scientology for sure. When she left the Church, the auditor got in trouble.\u0027          Valeska signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org at 14 The following year, after he split from Cruz, the Mission Impossible actor came back right after Maiden Voyage and it was his 42nd birthday, but Valeska was not invited. Miscavige made sure it was a night to be remembered. Cringe-worthy YouTube clips have surfaced from the event showing Cruise, now 56, singing and dancing to the band, then proclaiming: \u0027This is incredible... It\u0027s the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean: ever!\u0027Valeska says: \u0027The Starlight Cabaret, which is the entertainment and event space on the ship, was decorated for Tom\u0027s birthday, it looked ridiculous, there was every poster of every movie he\u0027d ever done, apart from ones with Nicole Kidman. She was considered a Suppressive Person. No Nicole posters allowed anywhere. \u0027They also did a concert and all the songs were from movies he\u0027d been in except Nicole ones. They flew his favorite Chinese chef to cook for him, this was all paid for by Scientology.\u0027I was one of the only people on the ship who was not allowed to go to his birthday, as I had the audacity to have a cold sore, I was so run down,\u0027 she says. From then on, she claims, she was taken off the ship for every Maiden Voyage. \u0027I got put in isolation, had an ethics interview, and security check to find out what my evil intentions were to COB and Shelly: Do you have an evil purpose to COB? Do you want to do something bad to him? They do this line of questioning until they find out why I am evil to them. And when you come up with nothing you get yelled at and told to confront your evil intentions,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was all a blessing in disguise, as I can\u0027t dance, and everyone was ordered to dance. There were three girls, who did dance, and then accused of flirting with him, so they were locked in a room, told to write up their crimes for being interesting in front of Tom Cruise.    Valeska says she considered Shelly (pictured left, and right, with Leah Remini) a \u0027mother figure\u0027 who took her under her wing           This is the Scientology base in Twin Peaks, California, where Shelly is believed to live          Valeska doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested and thinks she is not there against her will\u0027The only Scientology celebrity that COB likes is Tom Cruise, the others are all below him. Tom Cruise would call him on the phone, they\u0027d be on the phone all the time,\u0027 she claims.       Although Valeska feared Miscavige, she claims she had a close relationship with his wife, Shelly Miscavige, who has not been seen in public in more than a decade. \u0027But my relationship with Shelly was great, she kept an eye on me, and was keen for me to keep up with my education. Scientology didn\u0027t care, and we were never sent to school as Sea Org members,\u0027 she claims.  Valeska says Shelly was like a \u0027mother figure\u0027 to her and she kept in touch with her through letters even after she was sent away on Freewinds. \u0027We wrote letters for years, she took me under her wing. When I was first engaged to a guy, she wrote two pages demanding to know everything. From the age of 15 to 25, for ten years we would write back and forth,\u0027 she says.August marked the 12-year anniversary since Shelly was last seen in public. Former church members have speculated that she has been at a secret Scientology base called Twin Peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains since 2006.Valeska, however, has a different theory and doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested.\u0027She\u0027s not there against her will, the treatment she\u0027ll be getting is a lot better than most would receive. She\u0027s living in the mountains and, yes, sure, she\u0027s under security watch and it won\u0027t be like before, as she was living like a queen,\u0027 she says.\u0027Yet, it\u0027s not like she\u0027ll be in RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) conditions. Imagine his wife going into the RPF, she knows more than anyone about COB\u0027s secrets, he is going to have to keep her happy.\u0027The church has long denied any rumors suggesting Shelly is missing and have insisted that she is devoting her time to the work of the Church of Scientology.Valeska says she used to see Shelly on the ship when she came aboard for Maiden Voyage and the two kept in touch through written correspondence about their personal lives, including Valeska\u0027s first marriage. Weddings were common among Sea Org members and most married as teens and twenty-somethings since sexual contact is not allowed before marriage. \u0027When I was on the ship, I married a guy called Roberto, I was only 20. Shelly was pleased, she told me: Good, you have someone to look after you, I don\u0027t need to do it. She wanted to see all the photos from my wedding album,\u0027 she says.          Valeska eventually fled the church after completing RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) in Australia. She now lives with her husband and three kids - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, in Brisbane           An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad  The negative publicity rocked the church and Miscavige.\u0027I would hear him scream at the top of his lungs while I was working in the kitchen next to the execs room, I would be shaking, it was so scary. \u0027When Lisa McPherson happened, he changed. All of the execs he was friends with, that all disappeared. His circle went even smaller,\u0027 she alleges.Shelly\u0027s usually strong relationship with her husband began to falter - he dismissed the whole of his board of executives in favor of younger, more eager to please, dedicated Sea Org members, such as Lou Stuckenbrock, for whom he created the position \u0027COB Communicator\u0027.\u0027Shelly became more and more stressed out. COB would be in the dining room with his Communicator Lou and she would eat afterwards,\u0027 Valeska claims.\u0027In her letters she would never say anything, but she was writing less and less, I got the sense she was more stressed. She wasn\u0027t perfect, but she stood by COB for years, and I never saw them argue, but I always saw that he was very close with Lou.\u0027In 2005, he said in a meeting that Shelly had been taken off his lines, but he wasn\u0027t going to orce her, he was way too qualified to ever marry any other Sea Org member. She was extremely dedicated to him. His words were: She messed up his communication lines.\u0027 Shelly has since retreated from public life once a prominent member of the church, she was even absent at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u0027s wedding in 2006.In 2013, Hollywood actress and famous Church defector Leah Remini filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department for Shelly. Police eventually said that they had interviewed Shelly and confirmed she wasn\u0027t being held against her will and didn\u0027t want to make any public statement.  Valeska\u0027s correspondence with Shelly came to a stop after she left. She says her time at the church worsened in 2007, after she was sent to England \u0027on a mission\u0027 during Maiden Voyage.Only days into it, Valeska got into hot water for daring to speak to a married man and she was ordered back to the Freewinds and sent to the engine room. After all this treatment, Valeska was suicidal and desperate to get out.\u0027In my mind, I was either going to end it or get off that ship,\u0027 she adds. But Valeska also had no skills for the real world, her brother Raphael, 36, and father Jean, 66, were and still are in the church today, she\u0027d never be allowed to see them again if she absconded.She\u0027d also \u0027disconnected\u0027 from her mother Ariane and younger sister Melissa, 38, 14 years ago when they left the Church.\u0027They wouldn\u0027t let me off this ship. I had served COB and knew their dirty little secrets. It was still hard to leave, I\u0027d been in the Sea Org since 14, I had no education, no money, never had a bank account, I had no idea how to live in the real world.  \u0027I\u0027d lose my brother and father instantly, I didn\u0027t know if my mom or sister would reconnect or where they lived. I\u0027d been indoctrinated that Scientology is life,\u0027 she says.Valeska was sent to the RPF in Australia, in the hope that it would \u0027rehabilitate\u0027 her. During this time, she met Chris Guider, a former rugby league legend in Australia who gave it all up in the 80s for Scientology.\u0027After graduating the RPF, they started making my life hell again. They were threatening to send me back to the ship, but I\u0027d already decided I would never, ever go back to that place again,\u0027 she says.\u0027When we finally got free, we had no one to judge us, I could watch TV when I wanted to, I had a normal room that wasn\u0027t a dormitory, I felt so much freedom. That\u0027s when I realized that Scientology was, in a nutshell, s**t.\u0027I hadn\u0027t seen my mom and sister for ages. I hadn\u0027t seen my mom for so long that when I first saw her, I went up to the wrong person. We didn\u0027t recognize each other. \u0027My dad sent me a text saying he was going to disconnect from me for talking to my mom and sister, this was at the same time as I was eight months pregnant with my first child.\u0027Today, Chris and Valeska now live happily in Brisbane and have three children - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, three - but still live under the shadow of Scientology\u0027s disconnection policy.Valeska said: \u0027I have three children who\u0027ve never met their grandfather. I haven\u0027t spoken to my brother since 2010. My family is destroyed. But we got out and we\u0027re having a good life. Hopefully my dad and brother will wake up one day, and my door will always be open for them.\u0027In a statement to DailyMail.com the church said: \u0027What has been said about us all too often—as is the case here—is pure propaganda. It is inaccurate and intentionally avoids showing who Scientologists really are and what we do. \u0027Propagandists look to capitalize on the growing curiosity about Scientology. They have manufactured controversies where there are none while refusing to show the Church, its organizations, its humanitarian programs as well as its unprecedented growth in Churches worldwide.

Lidl then tweeted a tongue-in-cheek advert for an £89 Yamaha keyboardThe German supermarket tweeted: \u0027Just because you don\u0027t have £872 to spend on a piano, doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be the next Elton\u0027, alongside a picture of an £89.99 Yamaha keyboard.The picture is also captioned \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit funny...\u0027 Twitter users were quick to praise the witty response, calling it a \u0027masterstroke\u0027 while one user said \u0027give your marketing manager a rise\u0027.The official John Lewis account then tweeted Lidl a link to its £15 children\u0027s piano with the message: \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit cheaper\u0027.One wag replied to both saying: \u0027Do you pair want to leave this argument till the weekend. I’ve heard Saturday nights all right for fighting\u0027 - a joke linked to another of Sir Elton\u0027s big hits.                        Five actors aged between four and 50 were used to play Sir Elton, using prosthetics, CGI and help from the star and his husband David Furnish to ensure they had the same mannerisms and piano playing style.Viewers are taken back through key moments in his life with scenes of the star on stadium tours, travelling on a private jet, recording Your Song, playing the piano in a local pub and performing in a school recital. It ends with Sir Elton - then little Reg Dwight - running down the stairs on Christmas morning to see his grandmother Ivy and his mother, who brought him up together because his father, Stanley, was largely absent.John Lewis has said the advert is \u0027inspired by real events\u0027 but admits the finale involves \u0027some creativity\u0027 because the singer was never gifted a piano at Christmas, but he had learned to play at his grandmother\u0027s house - and denied claims they paid him £5million to take part. It is also the second of the retailer\u0027s Christmas ads to feature Your Song after singer Ellie Goulding recorded a cover for the 2010 campaign. The  nod to Elton\u0027s mother and the influence on his career comes almost a year after her death last December.Two years before she passed away the star found the courage to apologise to her after a nearly nine-year feud that culminated in her inviting an Elton John impersonator to perform at her 90th birthday party because she missed him so much.Elton severed all contact with her after a catastrophic argument where she blamed Elton\u0027s husband, David Furnish, for turning him against her.She was also upset the Candle In The Wind singer demanded she cut all ties with her longtime friends Bob Halley and John Reid, who had both been fired from his entourage after decades working for him.But he later sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died last year Elton spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September this year rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said:  \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. \u0027I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027. The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.Actor Simon Burbage plays Elton in the 1980s and 1990, while the lookalike used to recreate the scenes from the 1970s is Oliver Marshall. The singer as a teenager is played by Brandon Stein, while Hudson Trindall is performing at a piano recital and the young boy on Christmas morning is Freddie Henderson.           Sir Elton sings his first big hit Your Song in a present day gig but the advert goes all the way back to his 1950s childhood          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire      Sir Elton, again using an actor, is shown performing Your Song on TV and then recording it for an album in 1970  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up  Elton, played by Hudson Trindall, is shown performing in a school recital watched by his family in an advert inspired by events in his life (pictured, right, Elton as a child)           The heart of the advert is revealed at the end as Elton as a young boy tears the paper from the piano in front of his grandmother and mother, played by Deborah Baxter and Katie Bonna (left to right)          The child actor looks in wonder at the musical instrument with the message that gifts can inspire and change lives          The final scene shows Elton playing the same piano himself, although John Lewis admit while he learned to play with his grandmother he never received one as a Christmas giftJohn Lewis addressed speculation about the cost of this year\u0027s ad, describing reports that it had paid Sir Elton £5million as \u0027wildly inaccurate\u0027 and said the ad cost £7million with most of the money going on advertising spending.          Sir Elton said his mother Sheila (pictured together at his 50th birthday party in 1997) was an inspiration to him - but they had an eight-year feud before having a reconciliation two years before she died last DecemberIt added that Sir Elton had requested that a portion of his fee be donated to the Elton John Charitable Trust when he was first approached to be involved.  John Lewis customer director Craig Inglis said: \u0027The ad tells the story of why Elton\u0027s piano was more than just a gift and we hope to remind customers of that special moment when they\u0027ve given a gift at Christmas time that they know will be treasured forever.\u0027The retailer, which reported a 98.8 per cent profits crash for the first half of the year in September, said the ad was a \u0027crucial part\u0027 of its overall marketing campaign and \u0027one of the most effective marketing campaigns in the industry, delivering an excellent return on investment\u0027.John Lewis and Waitrose employees have been given the first opportunity to share the two minute and 20 second ad at 6am on Thursday before its launch on the store\u0027s social media channels, its website and in shops at 8am.The ad first airs on television on Thursday at 9.15pm during ITV\u0027s Dark Heart, although ITV viewers may have noticed that the theme tunes to some of the channel\u0027s shows including Coronation Street and This Morning were played solely in piano notes on Wednesday to tease the advert\u0027s premiere.Customers at the retailer\u0027s flagship Oxford Street branch can also step into a 2,000 square foot recreation of the ad production set to try on some of the costumes, listen to recordings from Elton John\u0027s 17-11-70 album and have photos taken at the piano.          The advert has been met with mixed reviews on social media with some viewers labelling it \u0027beautiful and powerful\u0027 and others asking if it is merely a promotional ad for the singer\u0027s upcoming tour John Lewis has moved away from cuddly toys this year and fans of the advert can enter a reproduction of Sir Elton\u0027s lounge now built in its Oxford Street store          The music studio where Your Song was recorded has also been lovingly rebuilt in the Oxford Street where shoppers can touch the mixing desk and play the grand piano          As part of the experience Elton\u0027s 1970s dressing room is open to the public where they can try wigs, glasses and his clothes  Classic tour T-shirts will be sold in John Lewis store but there will be no cuddly toys or other similar gifts for the 2018 advert  \u0027#fabulousfreddie!\u0027 Boy, 4, from Corrie actress Tina O\u0027Brien\u0027s drama school is revealed as child star of John Lewis advert as his proud mother shares Elton John\u0027s Instagram post about her sonThe mother of the child star of this year\u0027s John Lewis advert has spoken of her pride today after the long-awaited commercial was finally unveiled, calling her son #fabulousfreddie!Emma Henderson shared a picture of son Freddie, four, from the advert on Facebook, originally posted by Sir Elton John, with the department store\u0027s 2018 festive campaign based on his life.The mini-biopic, which cost £7million and is set to his 1970 hit Your Song, shows the Rocketman singer\u0027s career in reverse, featuring several actors in make-up and prosthetic playing him through the ages.Posting a picture of the youngster on Instagram, Sir Elton wrote: \u0027What a pleasure it was to be part of the wonderful @johnlewisandpartnersChristmas advert.\u0027Ms Henderson then shared it with the caption: \u0027When @eltonjohn posts a pic of your child\u0027s face! #fabulousfreddie @freddiesteddiego.\u0027          Freddie Henderson, four, has won rave reviews for his performance as young Elton John in the John Lewis Christmas advert and the musician posted a picture of the youngster on social media this morning which proud mother Emma Henderson shared on Facebook today, pictured          Ms Henderson, pictured with Freddie, captioned Sir Elton\u0027s post with #fabulousfreddie and said: \u0027When @eltonjohn posts a pic of your child\u0027s face!\u0027Drama school pupil Freddie was picked out from more than 1,000 hopefuls after auditioning for the advert, called The Boy and The Piano, earlier this year.

We are very, very proud. He beat more than 1,000 other boys and it is great for our small school because a lot of the big London agencies often get these roles.\u0027You don\u0027t get a bigger advert than the John Lewis Christmas ad so this could be a stepping stone to big things for Freddie\u0027.Ms Morgan added she expected the other pupils to be very excited about the advert but said Freddie had not been affected much by the exposure.She added: \u0027At his age, we try to teach them some improvisation, script work and try to get their imaginations going.\u0027We have a lot of talented children but since Freddie arrived we all said how confident, bubbly he was and how much of a spark he had.\u0027The school also confirmed Freddie would be watching tonight\u0027s first airing of the advert on ITV1 at 9.15pm with his family and it would be filming the moment to share with the public.Meanwhile O\u0027Brien, who plays Sarah in Coronation Street, added: \u0027I\u0027m so proud I could pop.\u0027   \u0027It\u0027s just one big plug for Elton!\u0027 John Lewis ides fans with \u0027not very Christmassy\u0027 festive advert as retailer is accused of \u0027selling out\u0027 by promoting singer\u0027s farewell tour and Rocketman film biopic Fans of the John Lewis Christmas advert are split today over the decision to have millionaire Sir Elton John at its heart.Critics have called the retailer\u0027s 2018 campaign a \u0027sell out\u0027 and a \u0027plug\u0027 for the star\u0027s farewell tour and his Rocketman biopic starring Taron Egerton, which is due for release next year.But others including stars James Corden and Susanna Reid have praised it with some fans claiming it is the retailer\u0027s \u0027best ever\u0027 Christmas commercial.Many said its message that one present can change a life reduced them to tears.   Some fans loved it - and saw it as a happy distraction from the Brexit chaos consuming the UK - with many crying through itThe £7million advert tells the tear-jerking story of his rise to fame and fortune from humble beginnings in Pinner, north London, where he was brought up by his mother Sheila and grandmother Rita.It ends with a four-year-old Elton - then Reg Dwight - unwrapping his first piano on Christmas Day in 1951 then cuts back to the present say showing the emotional 71-year-old playing the same instrument in front of the tree.It is followed by the slogan: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027 and the retailer has today started marketing pianos for £800 - the first time it has sold them for decades.Twitter went wild when it was released this morning - but it has split opinion.@mollytomkinss said: \u0027I feel truly sorry for anyone who can\u0027t understand the deeper meaning of the #JohnLewisChristmasAd this year.

Best ad since the penguins\u0027.   Elton John faces backlash for featuring his mother in John Lewis Christmas ad despite arguing with her for years           Sir Elton, pictured with his mother Sheila  after being knighted in 1998, had a series of damaging rows with her but they reconciled just before she diedSir Elton John healed the long and painful rift with his mother Sheila five months before her death last December  - but he has faced a backlash for featuring their relationship in the John Lewis Christmas advert released today.The star, 71, had been estranged from Mrs Farebrother for around nine years until May 2017 following rows over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish.Mrs Farebrother had encouraged her son to play piano from the age of three and was a constant throughout the majority of his extraordinary career.But their relationship faltered when she was in her 80s and she said two years ago her son \u0027hated\u0027 her after a series of bitter public rows.When she turned ninety she even invited an Elton John lookalike to perform because she missed him so much Despite their reconciliation last year some viewers of the John Lewis ad said it was wrong to put their sometimes rocky relationship at its heart.One fan said while watching today\u0027s advert: \u0027All I could think was: didn\u0027t Elton John famously cut his mum out of his life for years?\u0027 Another said: \u0027Nice ad for, erm... Elton John. Didn’t he refuse to speak to his mother for years? Nice that he appreciated her eventually\u0027, while one critic tweeted: \u0027Remember the time that Elton John’s mum hired an Elton John lookalike to play at her party? That didn’t make the cut into that ad\u0027.But others saw the other side and said: \u0027Such an emotional journey, so gripping, so true to life for so many people and heartfelt especially after @eltonofficial losing his Mother. Well done John Lewis this year!\u0027.Another added: \u0027I was quite moved by #JohnLewisChristmasAd. The power of music and a mother\u0027s love combined. Lovely\u0027.Mother and son\u0027s relationship appeared hit rock bottom in 2016, two years after he married Mr Furnish. Sheila had been a witness at their civil partnership in 2005.Sir Elton said: \u0027I don’t miss her. When she says things in the press, like, “I haven’t spoken to Elton since he married that f****** a****** David Furnish”. That was pretty hard to take\u0027.He added: \u0027I don’t hate my mother. I look after her but I don’t want her in my life.’But they made up fully around six months before she died last year, shortly after he was hospitalised for 12 days, including two nights in intensive care, after picking up a serious infection while touring South America.In May 2017 he confirmed they were close again after he shared a throwback picture on Twitter to celebrate reconnecting with Mrs Farebrother on America\u0027s Mother\u0027s Day with the message: \u0027So happy we are back in touch. Love, Elton.\u0027Mother and son fell out in 2008 after she allegedly refused his request not to talk to two of their oldest friends.          Sheila and Elton at the height of his fame in 1976 - she has been credited for being a driving force behind his career          1947: Elton John is born Reginald Dwight on March 25 to father Stanley and mother Sheila. As he grew up his father was largely absent and his mum encouraged him to play the piano from the age of three.His parents orce and Sheila remarries his stepfather John, and the couple encourage him to write songs and get him a job as a pub pianist age 15. She remained a strong and constant support during his long career. 2008: Mother and son fall out after a row over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish\u0027s influence on his career2015: Mrs Farebrother said that her son \u0027hated\u0027 her and gets an an Elton John impersonator at her 90th birthday party. He then sends a bunch of white orchids - his first contact for seven years. May 2017: He posts a US mother\u0027s day message saying he is \u0027happy they\u0027re in touch\u0027 - confirming they had reconciled their differences.December 4, 2017: Sheila Farebrother dies aged 92.                                                    This was further inflamed when she claimed that Elton never told her she had become a grandmother when boys Elijah and Zachary were born.In 2015 she told the Daily Mail that her son had called out of the blue and ordered her to cut off all contact with Bob Halley - Sir Elton\u0027s driver turned personal assistant, who he had fired after more than 30 years of service - and John Reid, with whom he had fallen out.Mrs Farebrother, who lived in a bungalow on the South Coast, said: \u0027I told him: \u0027I\u0027m not about to do that and drop them. Bob is like a son to me. He has always been marvellous to me and he lives nearby and keeps an eye on me\u0027.\u0027She said Sir Elton flew into an expletive-filled rage, adding: \u0027To my utter amazement, he told me he hated me.\u0027And he banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!\u0027She is said to have told him during the row: \u0027I said to him, And you think more of that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.\u0027During that period, however, it is understood Sir Elton continued to support Sheila financially and to provide a roof over her head, despite all that has passed between them.He is also said to have paid £30,00 for her double hip replacement.At one point she filled the void left by her son with a tribute act to the pop star.Sheila Farebrother hired him to provide the entertainment at her 90th birthday in March 2015 and would send emails to Mr Bacon, who himself described their link as \u0027quite surreal\u0027.Prompted by the milestone birthday, Sir Elton got in touch with his mother for the first time in seven years, sending her white orchids.They then continued to work on their relationship until their reconciliation was properly confirmed by Sir Elton in May 2017.The star last saw her a week before she died.When it was announced on December 4 last year he said he was in \u0027complete shock\u0027.He also posted a photograph of them together in happier times and wrote on Instagram: \u0027So sad to say that my mother passed away this morning. I only saw her last Monday and I am in shock. Travel safe Mum. Thank-you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton\u0027.The singer says he has been spurred on to shower his sons with affection because he received none from his own father.Elton took a swipe at his late father Stanley Dwight while giving a speech in which he said a lack of love had led him to drink and drugs.He said recently: \u0027I never stop telling them I love them, and they never stop telling me they love me\u0027.

As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room. The finished product ends up creating a shadow that looks like a woman walking her dog through the snow, accompanied by the tagline: \u0027Whoever you\u0027re looking for this Christmas.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Bug eyed puss called Wilfred internet star","story":"    Michael Rapaport at the \u0027White Famous\u0027 TV show premiere in LA, his cat video went viralThe strange looking feline sits completely still staring at the comedian who starred in Prison Break and Friends.The unflinching and lack of blinking seems to spook the actor who calls for his mother in his thick Manhattan accent. He says: \u0027Ma!

Whistle-blower Christopher Wylie appears before the Parliamentary Recording Unit (PRU) in Westminster to testify about Cambridge Analytica\u0027s misuse of Facebook dataIn a lengthy investigative is likely to trigger political repercussions in Washington, the Times argued that Facebook\u0027s way of dealing with crisis was to \u0027delay, deny and deflect\u0027. Facebook was also said to have employed a Republican firm specializing in opposition research to discredit activists, partly by linking them to the liberal investor Soros, who has become a favored target of Trump supporters and far-right conspiracy groups.Before and since this month\u0027s midterm elections, Facebook has shut down dozens of accounts on its own platform and on Instagram which it said were aimed at influencing the vote, and that it was exploring a possible link to Russia.  In the elections, the Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives, and the Times report is likely to add to political pressure on the company.The Times said its article was based on interviews with more than 50 people, including current and ex-Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. "},{"url":null,"title":"Oxford Dictionaries reveal word year TOXIC","story":"    Last year\u0027s word of the year was \u0027youthquake\u0027, defined as ‘a significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people’\u0027Not to mention the continued public condemnation of the toxicity of plastics.\u0027And its not just the physical being touted as toxic this year.\u0027Toxic has truly taken off into the realm of metaphor, people have reached for the word to describe workplaces, schools, cultures, relationships and stress.\u0027Lending a personal angle to this year of toxicity.\u0027Oxford Dictionaries mentioned the #MeToo movement which has spot a \u0027spotlight\u0027 on toxic masculinity.Fury at preening Tory saboteurs: Angry backlash against...Homeless man and couple \u0027MADE UP\u0027 heart-warming story that...Share this articleThe video added: \u0027While in politics more broadly the word has been applied to the rhetoric of policies, agendas and legacies of leaders and governments around the globe.\u0027In 2018 toxic has become a potent descriptor for the years most talked about topics adding more and more strings to its poisonous bow.\u0027It\u0027s the sheer scope of its application that has made it the standout choice for the Oxford word of the year.\u0027The top ten words used alongside toxic were chemical, masculinity, substance, gas, environment, relationship, culture, waste, algae and air. Last year\u0027s word of the year was \u0027youthquake\u0027, defined as ‘a significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Pregnant womans relaxing bath brought abrupt end pooch dives in","story":"The cute dog peeked his head over the top of the bath tub (left) before jumping in with his owner Connie (right)Puppy love!

First, I believe that the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.\u0027Second, I cannot support an indefinite backstop arrangement, where the EU holds a veto over our ability to exit.\u0027The terms of the backstop amount to a hybrid of the EU Customs Union and Single Market obligations.\u0027No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement.\u0027That arrangement is no also taken as the starting point for negotiating the Future Economic partnership.\u0027If we accept that, it will severely prejudice the second phase of negotiations against the UK.\u0027\u0027Above all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election. This is, at its heart, a matter of trust.\u0027I appreciate that you disagree with my judgement on these issues. I have weighed very carefully the alternative courses of action which the government could take, on which I have previously advised.\u0027Ultimately, you deserve a Brexit Secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction.\u0027I am only sorry, in good conscience, that I cannot.\u0027My respect for you, and the fortitude you have shown in difficult times, remains undimmed.\u0027          A vocal Brexiteer, Esther McVey became the second Cabinet minister to quit this morning - following Mr Raab out of the doorWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVeyA vocal Brexiteer, Esther McVey became the second Cabinet minister to quit this morning - following Mr Raab out of the door.A former GMTV presenter, she was first elected an MP in 2010,  but lost her seat of Wirral West in 2015, before making a dramatic parliamentary return  by taking George Osborne\u0027s seat of Tatton after he quit over Brexit.The 51 year-old is one of the party\u0027s best media performers and tipped as a possible leadership contender. Last month, in an interview with the Daily Mail, Miss McVey revealed how she had been put into foster care as a baby after she was born to young parents.She quit today, slamming the PM for breaking her Brexit promises and saying she could not look her constituents \u0027in the eye\u0027 and back the deal.Esther McVey\u0027s resignation letter in full:\u0027There is no more important task for this Government than delivering on the United Kingdom\u0027s decision to leave the European Union. This is a matter of trust. It is about the future of our country and the integrity of our democracy.\u0027The deal you put before the Cabinet yesterday does not honour the result of the referendum. Indeed, it doesn\u0027t meet the tests you set from the outset of your premiership.\u0027\u0027Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our orders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy. I have always supported you to deliver on those objectives.\u0027Even after Chequers when you knew I shared the concerns of a very significant number of colleagues, I believed that we could still work collectively to honour the will of the British people and secure the right outcome for the future of our country. This deal fails to do this.          Esther MCvey quit today, slamming the PM for breaking her Brexit promises and saying she could not look her constituents \u0027in the eye\u0027 and back the deal (pictured, letter) \u0027The proposals put before cabinet, which will soon be judged by the entire country, mean handing over around £39bn to the EU without anything in return. It will trap us in a customs union, despite you specifically promising the British people we would not be.\u0027It will bind the hands of not only this, but future governments in pursuing genuine free trade policies. We wouldn\u0027t be taking back control, we would be handing over control to the EU and even to a third country for arbitration.\u0027It also threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom, which as a Unionist is a risk I cannot be party to.\u0027The British people have always been ahead of politicians o this issue, and it will be no good trying to pretend to them that this deal honours the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone it doesn\u0027t.\u0027We have gone from no deal is better than a bad deal, to any deal is better than no deal. \u0027I cannot defend this, and I cannot vote for this deal.\u0027\u0027I cannot defend this, and I cannot vote for this deal. I could not look my constituents in the eye were I to do that. I therefore have no alternative but to resign from the Government.\u0027It has been a huge honour to serve as Secretary as State for Work and Pensions, and I am immensely proud of the part I have played in the record levels of employment we have seen in all parts of the UK. Youth unemployment is has halved since 2010, and we now have record number of women and BAME in work and since 2013, 973,000 more disabled people in work.\u0027With employment over 3.3 million more than in 2010 we have helped 1,000 more people into work each and every day since we took office.\u0027I am extremely grateful to you for appointing me to the role, and for the support you have given to me, not least in the run up to the budget, ensuring Universal Credit got a much need injection of £4.5 billion. That has made my decision a greater wrench.\u0027However, in politics you have to be true to the public and also true to yourself.

The EU Referendum offered a simple choice - to either stay in or leave the EU. \u0027The result was decisive with the UK public voting to leave and that is what we, their elected representatives, must deliver.\u0027The agreement put forward, however, does not do that as it leaves the UK in a half-way house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation. \u0027Given the past performance of the EU, there is every possibility that the UK-EU trade deal that we seek will take years to conclude. We will be locked in a Customs arrangement indefinitely, bound by rules determined by the EU over which we have no say.\u0027Worse, we will not be free to leave the Customs arrangement unilaterally if we wish to do so. \u0027Northern Ireland in the meantime will be subject to a different relationship with the EU from the rest of the UK and whilst I agree there should be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom must be respected.\u0027With respect Prime Minister, this agreement does not provide for the United Kingdom being a sovereign, independent country leaving the shackles of the EU, however it is worded. \u0027We are a proud nation and it is a sad day when we are reduced to obeying rules made by other countries who have shown they do not have our best interests at heart.\u0027We can and must do better than this.

One which I never expected to compose. It has been an immense honour to support you in delivering the historic opportunity of leaving the EU as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union. \u0027It has, in many ways, been a dream job which I have enjoyed tremendously. However, despite my strenuous attempts, I now find myself unable to sincerely support the deal agreed yesterday by Cabinet. It is therefore with deep regret that I tender my resignation.          Suella Braverman (resignation letter, pictured) is very close to leading Eurosceptics Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker - who are leading the bid to oust Mrs May as leader\u0027My reasons are simple. Firstly, the proposed Northern Ireland Backstop is not Brexit. \u0027It is not what the British people - or my constituents - voted for in 2016. It prevents an unequivocal exit from a customs union with the EU. This robs the UK of the main competitive advantages from Brexit.\u0027Without a unilateral right to terminate or a definite time limit to the Backstop, our numerous promises to leave the customs union will not be honoured. 17.4 million people voted for the UK to leave the EU in our own sovereign way and at a time of our choosing. \u0027The backstop renders this impossible and generations of people will see this as betrayal.\u0027Secondly, the Backstop proposals set out different regulatory regimes for Northern Ireland and Great Britain threatening to break up our precious Union. I am confident - having met with customs professionals in my role at the Department - that this could have been avoided.\u0027Throughout this process, I have compromised. I have put pragmatism ahead of idealism and understand that concessions are necessary in a negotiation. I have kept faith in the ultimate destination to justify an uncomfortable journey. \u0027However I have reached a point where I feel that these concessions do not respect the will of the people - the people who put us here and whom we humbly serve. We must not let them down.\u0027I thoroughly enjoyed working at the Department and have been supported by excellent civil servants. To them, I am grateful.\u0027Thank you for the opportunity. I have immense respect for the way in which you have conducted yourself during these very difficult times. I know how extremely hard you have worked to serve our national interest.\u0027I look forward to working to deliver Brexit in the best possible way from the Backbenches.\u0027 Ranil Jayawardena, aide to the Justice SecretaryRanil Jayawardena resigned as aide to the Justice Secretary saying the deal \u0027does not deliver a good and fair Brexit\u0027. The former solicitor and father-of-two said that he wants  the Government to focus  on running the country and not be entirely defined by the European question.He attended the ERG group meeting in parliament shortly after handing in his resignation.             Ranil Jayawardena resigned as aide to the Justice Secretary saying the deal \u0027does not deliver a good and fair Brexit\u0027 (file pic)Ranil Jayawardena\u0027s resignation letter in full:\u0027This is a pivotal time for the United Kingdom. It is important to deliver on the democratic decision of the people.\u0027It is important to get the right deal for our country. And it is important for every member to act in good conscience.\u0027That is why, with regret, I must offer my resignation as parliamentary private secretary to the minister of justice.\u0027At the last election, you said: Our future property, our place in the world, our standard of living, and the opportunities we want for our children - and our children\u0027s children - all depend on getting  the next five years right.\u0027 I agree. But I cannot agree, in the cold light of day, that the deal in front of us today is right for our country.\u0027It does not deliver a good and fair Brexit.

We will be locked into, amongst other deficiencies, European Union law....\u0027He added: \u0027This is not taking back control of our laws. Further, at the last election we committed to leave the single market and the customs union. \u0027We committed to pursuing free trade agreements with other countries at the same time as maintaining free trade with European markets. he draft agreements put these and other commitments at risk to. \u0027I entered public service not to be defined by the European question,  but to deliver for my constituents and for our country. To provide the right infrastructure for our economy to grow. \u0027To secure the best education for our children so they have better lives tomorrow than they have today. To protect the public by enforcing our laws and our borders.\u0027I will continue to work hard from the backbenches to deliver on these priorities and for my constituents as their local Member of Parliament.\u0027Anne-Marie Trevelyan, aide to Education Secretary Damian Hinds    Anne-Marie Trevelyan is an ardent Brexiteer and handed in her resignation after Dominic Raab had already announced his.She was elected the MP for Berwick upon Tweed in May 2015.          Anne-Marie Trevelyan is an ardent Brexiteer and handed in her resignation after Dominic Raab had already announced his (file pic)Anne-Marie Trevelyan\u0027s resignation letter in full:\u0027Dear Prime Minister,\u0027It is with a profoundly heavy heart that I tender my resignation as Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Department of Education, as I cannot support the Withdrawal Agreement which you have agreed with the EU.\u0027It has been an honour to serve in your Government both in education and previously as PPS in the Ministry of Defence. I will continue to speak up on all those matters close to my heart around the armed forces covenant and special educational needs, to try to move policy decision forwards in the future.\u0027I have struggled for months to continue to give you my support on Brexit, as you nettled through the most difficult of public negotiations to find a new relationship with the EU after we have left next year. Despite my own convictions on Brexit, I have always been a pragmatist and understood there would likely be areas of mutually agreed future partnership which I would not be wholly supportive, but could live with and justify to my constituents.          Anne-Marie Trevelyan blasted the PM\u0027s Brexit plan in her resignation letter (pictured)\u0027Sadly, the deal which you and your Cabinet have approved is not one which I can support. It is now clear to me that the negotiations have been built on the UK trying to appease the EU and we have allowed ourselves to be led into a deal which is unacceptable to the 17.4million voters who asked for us to step away from the EU project and become an independent coastal state in name only.\u0027As an MP bordering Scotland, the regulatory framework agreement for Northern Ireland is very important to me, and I cannot support the position the EU agreement takes. I believe that it poses a real threat to the stability and integrity of the Union. The indefinite backstop arrangement agreed is also unacceptable, since it leaves the UK permanently trapped in a customs union, which will restrict forever our trade prospects. \u0027I cannot agree to a deal in which my country will have its unique innovative spirit crushed by removing the great opportunity of competitive advantage for the decades ahead.\u0027Some would say well just agree the treaty as it is now then bin it later. But I don\u0027t believe in that way of doing business – if we sign a treaty I want us to stand by it. I believe we must protect the Brexit mandate by trying to secure a deal which understands the spirit of the referendum, or we must have the leadership courage to deliver a WTO deal and work on a trade agreement later.\u0027It has been an honour and a privilege to serve my country in your Government.\u0027Yours sincerely, Anne Marie\u0027 Rehman Chishti, Tory party vice chairman          Rehman Chishti, joined the wave of resignations which hit Mrs May today (file pic)Rehman Chishti, joined the wave of resignations which hit Mrs May today.He had originally stood as a Labour party candidate in the 2005, but later joined the Tories and was elected MP for Gillingham and Rainham in 2010.Rehman Chishti\u0027s resignation letter:  \u0027It was an honour to be appointed by you as the vice chairman of the Conservative Party and also to serve as your trade envoy to Pakistan.\u0027I regret to inform you that having seen the draft EU Withdrawal Agreement and listened to your statement in the House today, after reflecting on this matter and taking into account wider considerations which I will duly outline, I regret to inform you that I am resigning from both my positions with immediate effect.\u0027At the outset, this, for me, is about delivering on the promises we made to the British People at the General Election last year in our manifesto, that leaving the European Union means leaving the single market and customs union, that the UK will be taking back control over our laws, our borders and our money.\u0027I have repeatedly made this point whilst representing our party to many different media outlets as vice chairman.\u0027It would not be appropriate for me to continue in these roles as it would require me to advocate for a position which I feel is contrary to our firm manifesto commitment which I stood for in 2017 and have publicly advocated since.          Rehman Chishti handed in his resignation letter today (pictured) with a swipe at May\u0027s Brexit policy\u0027The terms of the backstop in effect amount in my view to a hybrid membership of the EU customs union and single market and further the EU would have a veto over our ability to exit.\u0027The UK in effect will be a part of a system where it will be a rule taker without any say on the rules.\u0027The second point which brings me to write this letter is the manner in which the Government has dealt with the regarding Asia Bibi. This is a case that I have worked on passionately since 2012, alongside Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, the former Bishop of Rochester, to ensure that justice is done which was handed down by the Pakistan Supreme Court only recently.\u0027What I fond shocking, is that the Government is failing to put into practice the core values our country stands for: religious freedom , justice, morally doing the right thing, and that when we see injustice where an inidual\u0027s life is in clear danger ad they have been persecuted for their faith, we do all that we can to help them.\u0027The Government should not wait to see if another country offers sanctuary, we should have had the conviction to lead on this matter and offer sanctuary ourselves straight away.\u0027The letter which I sent to you regarding this matter on 13th November now has the support of some 124 MPs and Lords. I would be grateful if you can personally intervene in his case to ensure that a morally right decision is finally made which takes into account our core values, irrespective of the position that any other country may take on this.\u0027It was a pleasure to be appointed by you to serve as your PM trade envoy to Pakistan for the past 14 months, a country that I passionately care about. Thanks to the fantastic work and hard effort of our UK Pakistan Trade team, trade between our two countries has increased by over 10 per cent in the last year alone, and now stands at £2.9billion.\u0027I will continue to work day and night to ensure that we have a Conservative government which continues to help create a country that works for all with the core belief of aspiration and opportunity for all.\u0027  Niki Da Costa, Downing Street Director of Legislative AffairsMs Da Costa is a senior aide in Downing Street tasked with pushing legislation for Brexit through the Commons in concert with ministers. She said: \u0027It has been an honour to serve the PM and I have huge respect for her.

There are few fixed rules but Sir Graham is likely to inform Downing Street or the Chief Whip and then make a public announcement.Sir Graham is likely to check with the MPs who have sent him a letter before making an announcement in case any of them want to withdraw. This will happen secretly.How will the vote happen? After it is announced, a vote will happen quickly, with Tory MPs invited to cast a secret ballot in a Commons committee room.Voting will be open for one day and Sir Graham will announce the result at the end.          Brexiteers have attempted a coup against Theresa MayWhat needs to happen for Theresa May to win? Officially, Mrs May only needs to win a simple majority of Tory MPs - currently that is 158 MPs.Politically, winning by one would be devastating. If more than 100 MPs vote against her, most observers think she would be finished.What happens if she loses? Mrs May is sacked as Tory leader and Sir Graham will announce a leadership contest. She cannot stand in the contest.She will probably stay on as Prime Minister until a replacement is elected but have no political power or authority to do anything.What happens next? In a Tory leadership contest, any MP can stand with a proposer and seconder.Tory MPs vote several times a week on the candidates with the last place candidate being removed from the race at each ballot.When there are only two candidates remaining, a run off is held among all Tory members in the country.How long will it take? The first phase depends on how many candidates there are. A large field could mean a fortnight or more of regular ballots.In the past, the second round has taken anywhere from four to 12 twelve weeks - but some think a vote of Tory members could be finished in just a week.                            "},{"url":null,"title":"Tutu wearing rhino excited squirrel winners comedy animal photo competition","story":"    Mary McGowan from Tampa, Florida, won the overall award and picked up the People\u0027s Choice Award and Creatures of the Land award for \u0027Caught in the Act\u0027, a picture of a petrified looking squirrel          A brown bear appears to have had enough, taken by Valterri Mulkahainen in Martinselkonen, Finland          A polar bear looks as if he is the one calling the shots in this picture by Roie Galitz taken in Svalbard, in the Norwegian ArcticEXCLUSIVE: Meet one-year-old Tipper, dubbed the Miracle...Puppy love!

Tory Party rules allow the MPs to force a vote of no confidence in their leader. How is that triggered? A vote is in the hands of the chairman of the Tory Party\u0027s backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady.A vote of no confidence must be held if 15 per cent of Tory MPs write to the chairman. Currently that threshold is 48 MPs.Letters are confidential unless the MP sending it makes it public. This means only Sir Graham knows how many letters there are. This possible delay could give Mrs May a \u0027grace period\u0027 where she knows a contest is imminent but not yet public knowledge.  Jacob Rees-Mogg names FOUR contenders who could do a better...Who could replace Theresa May? As Brexiteers move against...Share this articleHow is a vote announced? There are few fixed rules but Sir Graham is likely to inform Downing Street or the Chief Whip and then make a public announcement.Sir Graham is likely to check with the MPs who have sent him a letter before making an announcement in case any of them want to withdraw. This will happen secretly. How will the vote happen? After it is announced, a vote will  happen quickly, with Tory MPs invited to cast a secret ballot in a Commons committee room.Voting will be open for one day and Sir Graham will announce the result at the end.  What needs to happen for Theresa May to win? Officially, Mrs May only needs to win a simple majority of Tory MPs - currently that is 158 MPs.Politically, winning by one would be devastating. If more than 100 MPs vote against her, most observers think she would be finished.            A vote is in the hands of the chairman of the Tory Party\u0027s backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady (file image) What happens if she loses? Mrs May is sacked as Tory leader and Sir Graham will announce a leadership contest. She cannot stand in the contest.She will probably stay on as Prime Minister until a replacement is elected but have no political power or authority to do anything.   What happens next? In a Tory leadership contest, any MP can stand with a proposer and seconder.Tory MPs vote several times a week on the candidates with the last place candidate being removed from the race at each ballot.When there are only two candidates remaining, a run off is held among all Tory members in the country.How long will it take? The first phase depends on how many candidates there are. A large field could mean a fortnight or more of regular ballots.In the past, the second round has taken anywhere from four to 12 twelve weeks - but some thing a vote of Tory members could be finished in just a week.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Two thirds Britains bank branches closed past 30 years towns without any","story":"    Ann Smith from Purley in Surrey used to bank in Coulsdon until her branch closed this summerAnn Smith was left high and dry last year when her local NatWest branch closed its doors.The former French teacher, who lives in Purley, Surrey, did her banking at a branch in Coulsdon, which closed in June last year.She said the closure had a major impact on her banking, adding: ‘It’s nonsense to claim that people don’t need branches any more.‘I don’t do online banking as I don’t feel very happy with the security side of things.’The branch said it was closing due to ‘a reduction in customer footfall’, but the 74-year-old said there was always a queue. She added: ‘Customers feel their loyalty has been taken for granted.’ Closures hit rural communities especially hard, with those on low incomes and the elderly most likely to suffer.Tory MP Simon Clarke, a member of the Treasury committee, which is investigating the diminishing accessibility of financial services, said: ‘Banks are depriving people of essential services.‘With no bank manager on hand vulnerable people are left without any guidance on financial matters.’Parliamentary records show there were 20,583 branches in 1988, but the consumer group’s analysis shows that there are just 7,586 today.Sparsely-populated parts of Scotland account for the top 70 communities farthest from a bank.Areas where recent closures have led to towns or villages without a single branch include Lymm in Cheshire, Broseley in Shropshire, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Sturminster Newton in Dorset.While banks argue that one of the country’s 11,500 Post Office branches can plug the gap, there are many crucial banking services they do not offer.These include opening or closing accounts, transferring money between accounts, making a complaint about the bank and requesting a replacement debit card.Banks also require customers to call into a branch for matters such as anti-fraud checks or to discuss legal documents such as lasting power of attorney.Almost half of those surveyed by Which? said they were unlikely to use a Post Office for banking services, questioning the level of staff expertise in financial services and complaining about long queues.Martin Kearsley, banking services director at the Post Office, said: ‘We are uniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country. It’s a responsibility that we take very seriously.’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Tory voters want poll finds","story":"    Tory voters oppose the attempt by rebel Conservative MPs to depose Theresa May and do not want Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg – or any of her rivals to replace herThey are among the findings of a Survation opinion poll conducted for the Daily Mail yesterday as Mr Rees-Mogg led a bid by pro-Brexit Tory MPs to unseat the Prime Minister.His actions are opposed by Conservative supporters, according to the survey.Asked who would make the best Prime Minister, Mrs May scores 60 to Mr Johnson’s 31.

But once the celebrities got to know you, they realised you weren’t such a bad old fruit’ I can barely remember when this was taken, one of those glam parties at Annabel’s in the late 1980s, when men had to wear black tie and women had to look absolutely scrumptious to get in. That period was a bit of a blur and Annabel’s was just a vortex.From 1973 to 1980, I worked outside Annabel’s, the London club on Berkeley Square. Everyone went there back then: Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson, Joan Collins, even Princess Diana. I would stand with Nando the doorman, a great guy with this big moustache, and wait for people to leave. Nando and I used to keep each other company, though he never told me who was in there. He was discreet like that.My nights started at 10.30pm and finished at 2am. I was young enough to handle the hours. I didn’t get inside until the 1980s: it was a big moment and you had to earn your stripes. Once the celebrities got to know you, they realised you weren’t such a bad old fruit. You just had to put your best suit on, smile and blend in. It wasn’t that difficult to approach people. They knew I’d be there and they would be friendly.My big break came in 1975. Liz Taylor was throwing a 50th birthday party for Richard Burton, whom she had just remarried. It was at the Dorchester and I was sent by the Evening Standard to get a picture. Every photographer had been turned away but I hid behind an assistant and slid in through some glass doors.The room was empty except for the DJ. I told him who I was, he handed me some records and showed me how the DJ booth worked, so I could pass unnoticed. Suddenly the room filled up with Richard’s friends, who had all come from Wales. Then the cake got rolled in. I got some pictures of the pair of them blowing out candles and I suppose I got confident, because I followed them to the dancefloor.I never asked if I could take some pictures, I just shot them. Liz turned to me and, in this soft tone, said: “I don’t know who you are – get out.” That was the beginning of a lovely friendship. I sent her the birthday pictures and, after that, she invited me to all sorts of events, from the Chelsea flower show to when she became a dame in 2000.I shot on black and white until the mid-1990s and kept using film until the end of the decade. Most of my early pictures were with a Leica M4. Even after the advent of digital, I continued shooting with Leicas. I preferred what you got and the way they handled: they’re small and unobtrusive, fitting easily into my pocket.It’s difficult doing this job for a long time. Some of my dearest friends have gone: Freddie Mercury, George Harrison, and of course Liz. It’s got to the point where I’m running out of people. My heyday ran from 1970 until 1995. That was when there was money in the industry and people took us seriously – we weren’t out on the streets being paparazzi.The whole industry has changed now. Everyone has a cameraphone and the way celebrities are photographed is intrusive. Today, I only go somewhere if I’m commissioned. Otherwise I stay at home and watch Tottenham on TV. I’d rather become a cab driver than start doing this now. I’ve had breakfast with Nelson Mandela, lunch with the Dalai Lama, but I’d still like to have dinner with Bob Dylan – if only to find out where he gets his suits from.• This photograph will be auctioned for charity at Christie’s on 20 November with other shots from Annabel’s, 1963-2018.

Winning the £30,000 Hepworth prize for sculpture may go some way to changing that.Simon Wallis, the director of the Hepworth Wakefield gallery that organises the prize, said Wyn Evans’s recent work was particularly powerful. The gallery is named after the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, who was born and brought up in Wakefield.“He has been influential for decades but I think his work has just got ever more extraordinary really,” said Wallis. “His recent work has been truly exceptional, extending the possibilities of what sculpture can be.”One of Wyn Evans’s best known recent works was his giant, twisting white neon installation displayed in the central Duveen galleries of London’s Tate Britain in 2017. Forms in Space … by Light (in Time) consisted of 2km of neon suspended in the air like a huge, frozen, fireworks display.In Cardiff this year he unveiled a neon light installation in the National Museum, where he was inspired as a child.For the Wakefield show, which featured work by all the shortlisted artists, Wyn Evans made a floating sculpture with 37 glass crystal flutes powered by organ pumps that emit sounds which are, in effect, a musical performance.Wyn Evans was almost dumbstruck at hearing he had won on Thursday night, and was close to tears when his prize was announced at a dinner at the gallery. He said nothing apart from thanking his friend, Tom Foulsham, the person who physically made the work on display at Wakefield. He was presented with the prize by the gallery’s chair, Alice Rawsthorn.Later, Wyn Evans said he respected how hard people worked on the prize and how good it was that it raised awareness around sculpture. He was particularly moved that it might inspire young people. But for him personally? “It means nothing,” he said. “I’m a Buddhist you see. The literal meaningness of the prize ... when did you last read Marcel Proust?”Asked what it meant to win a prize for sculpture, Wyn Evans said: “I always hated sculpture, it’s absolutely true. I went to Saint Martins and I was bullied by all these macho men who said ‘oh no, sculptures are made like this’. I said, ‘I thought sculptures were made by pouring a bottle of lemonade into the sea, actually’. They disagreed.”Born in 1958 in Llanelli, Wyn Evans also studied at the Royal College of Art in London. His early career included working as an assistant on Jarman’s films Caravaggio and The Last of England and on music videos for the Smiths and the Fall, after which he moved into conceptual installation and sculptural work. In 2003 he represented Wales in its first pavilion at the Venice Biennale.Wyn Evans was chosen from a shortlist that also comprised Mona Hatoum, Magali Reus, Phillip Lai and Michael Dean.He is the second recipient of the biennial prize that was introduced by the Hepworth when it spotted a gap in the busy art prize calendar. The first winner in 2016 was Helen Marten who, weeks later, also won the Turner prize.“We want to build a new audience for sculpture and we want to build on Barbara Hepworth’s legacy,” said Wallis. “We want people to understand how sculpture responds to our contemporary experiences.”The judges award the prize to a British-based artist they consider to be at the top of their game in sculpture.Wallis said: “What are they doing now? What is the state of their art and their contribution to sculpture right at this very moment? I still maintain sculpture is one of the most vital art forms now because of the sheer range of things that happen within it whereas with something like painting, you are still very bounded. Sculpture has bled into so many interesting territories.”The winner was decided after a lengthy meeting of a judging panel consisting of Sarah Brown (Leeds Art Gallery), Martin Clark (Camden Arts Centre), Margot Heller (South London Gallery) and Helen Legg (Tate Liverpool). It was chaired by Wallis.“The judges found all of the artists’ exhibitions incredibly strong and compelling in different ways, capturing the vitality of sculpture being made today. It was very difficult to choose an overall winner,” said Wallis.• The Hepworth Prize for Sculpture, featuring work by the five shortlisted artists, is at Hepworth Wakefield until 20 January 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3290bef672c495d7bbe983ad9710d6d4b2cf7982/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2962ee387d67d6d619c24c876477c27c","title":"he saved my life readers memories of stan lee","story":"We asked you to share your tributes and memories of the comic book legend. Here’s what some of you saidI was blessed to meet him a few years ago, when I was costuming as Wolverine. At that time, multiple sclerosis had really taken a grip on me, and Stan took the time to step away from his photo shoots, sit me down and have a lovely chat. I’ll never forget, when thanking him for filling my childhood and beyond with tales of such amazing superheroes, he told me that people like me in his words, who put disability aside to help others and push through adversity, “were the true superheroes”. Those words stay with me every day. Bless you Stan for being such inspiration. tachikomaI had reading difficulties when I was in primary school back in the early 60s, but over time managed to understand the text and speech bubbles in comics more easily than pages in text in books. Thanks, Stan, for being one of the people who taught me how to read when my school couldn’t and for being one of the creators who gave me a world of amazing characters to engage with at a time when I was a pretty lonely little girl. I still read comics, but also became a voracious reader of books because of them. Madeleine WolfeStan Lee saved my life. Possibly. When I was six, a car hit me as I crossed a road (the man was on green, so I ran. Look both ways, kids!). Just before it did, I tried to jump, as Spider-Man had done in the comic colouring book I had just read. He got a bit higher than I did, having recently been bitten by a radioactive spider, but my tiny leap might have been the difference between flying over, as I did, and going under. Or it could have made no difference at all. But my point is RIP Stan, thanks for the magic. guyfmI was lucky enough to meet Stan a few years ago at a convention in London. He was clearly frail and needed help to walk and steady himself, but seemed overjoyed that so many people had come out to see him and support his work. His enthusiasm for his fans made him appear much younger than the 90+ years he was at the time. Although the meeting was brief and consisted little more of a few words, a handshake and a photograph it was an unforgettable experience. It was a rare opportunity to meet a man whose work had a profound impact on my early life and must be considered among the 20th century’s most influential writers and creators. Marc Casson, college lecturer, north WalesGrowing up in war-torn Belfast, I was lucky for two reason: the local library at the bottom of my street, and my father as a merchant seaman, bringing home a suitcase filled with American comic books, from New York, every trip to sea. I rarely attended school, for numerous reasons, but learned the love of words through Stan’s writing. I always wanted to be a writer, even though I knew I could never become one because of my working-class background. Then I listened to Stan’s advice: “The only advice anybody can give is, if you wanna be a writer, keep writing. And read all you can, read everything.” So I did, and I am! Thank you Stan, warts and all. Sam Millar, writer, BelfastMy favourite recent cameo of his was from the Spider-Man game that came out a few months ago. You tend to expect cameos in all Marvel movies but for some reason the cameo in the game took me by surprise. Even though it was an animated version rather than his actual likeness, it captured all his charm and I was grinning like an idiot when i saw it. Turns out it’ll be the last one released before his death. Fitting that it was Spider-Man. RIP Stan. dsk84A huge escapist part of my otherwise anxious and sometimes fear-driven childhood. I know he sometimes blurred the details of who created what, with Kirby and Ditko especially, but even if he just mostly left him and the others to get on with it, to later become the brash salesmanfront man, he must have been doing something right. Though he didn’t always make the best business decisions. But thank you Stan, for brightening up my young world. PP100I thought it would be nice to share my father’s memories of Stan Lee with you along with a photo of the A1 size drawing of the superhero Stan and Herb Trimpe created during a 1975 BBC Pebble Mill at One interview. Personally I am a life long Marvel fan, as are “Seymour-Man’s” grandchildren so the fact that their grandpa is not only their real life superhero but also a Stan Lee created Marvel one is priceless. The following is my dad, David Seymour’s, fond recollection of Stan’s visit to the Pebble Mill studios:“In 1975, I was a BBC reporter and television presenter working on a daily network magazinetalk show on BBC One called Pebble Mill, named after the the broadcasting centre in Birmingham. I vividly remember interviewing Stan Lee during his visit to the UK, promoting the Son of Origins, which described the creation of several Marvel Comic superheroes. Stan was a great guest both on and off the set. He was helpful, charming, talkative and inventive. It was an extended interview and Stan decided to transform me into a new type of superhero.“I was young, British, black-haired and, Stan claimed, clearly suitable for transformation. It’s 43 years ago, and I forget now what superpowers Stan endowed me with, but as we talked live on British TV, the Marvel artist Herb Timpe sketched out the the new creation: he was called Seymour-Man. I have the sketch to this day, signed by its creators, Stan and Herb. It graces one of our guest bedrooms at home in Northumberland and has always intrigued our grandchildren. Sadly, I never developed the super powers that Stan had described. But now, silver-haired, I’m still Seymour-Man.” Ben Seymour, 42, Newcastle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/201a8fefebe46d8e78af0dac16aac8568cd93512/29_745_3303_1982/master/3303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be5d7cac56b3c273bc48694e491360ec","title":"three days ice monster 110000 books how does david walliams do it","story":"With his latest book the fastest-selling title since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the celebrity author is getting something rightI was incredibly fearful as a child: I hid my copy of The Witches at the top of a cupboard so it couldn’t “get” me and I made my mum read the Gollum bits of The Hobbit out loud for me, as I was too scared to do it myself. So I was ready to deal with any literary terrors my children might bring to me sensitively and kindly. No go: as yet, my eight-year-old has been unafraid of everything from Gollum to Voldemort, and my kind and understanding face has been unrequired. Except on one occasion – for which I can blame David Walliams.As Walliams’s latest children’s book racks up yet more incredible sales – the Bookseller reports that The Ice Monster sold more than 110,000 copies in just three days, making it the fastest-selling title since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child – I am reminded, with great fondness, of one of his previous books, The World’s Worst Children 2. Not only is this one of the books that helped to persuade my daughter of the joys of reading, the short, funny chapters and joyous illustrations from Tony Ross tempting her into giving it a go all by herself it’s also the book that first showed her just how much fun a good scare can be. As yet, Walliams’s story of Fussy Frankie who wouldn’t eat his vegetables and who ends up being eaten by them, is the only one to have given her nightmares. I never expected to have to comfort her about the fact that she’ll never actually be eaten alive by peas and cabbages, but there you go: different folks, different strokes. And the illustrations are, I will acknowledge, pretty terrifying.I have to admit that I don’t particularly enjoy reading Walliams aloud – I’m not amused by the stories in the way I am by Roald Dahl’s, say. But the children I know all love him – they act out World’s Worst Children stories in the playground and at home, competing to come up with the most horrific outcome for their characters. You could credit his runaway success to his celebrity – but there are a ton of celebrities who think they can make a go of it as a children’s author, and who haven’t made an impact like Walliams on the book charts. The combination of a fabulous illustrator, a level of rudeness that children find appealing, and, of course, a heavy investment from his publisher coupled with the boost that glossy television adaptations brings, means that all those fart jokes are obviously working on the demographic they’re aimed at. Because his sales are truly astonishing: he was the bestselling author of last year, earning £13.8m the first to spend 100 weeks in a row in the top spot on the children’s charts and has had three books from his backlist sell more than 1m copies.So after trying – horribly keenly and without much success – to push the books I loved as a child on to my daughter, I’ve decided to leave her to make her own selections. Well, as much as possible: I can’t help butting in now and then. The World’s Worst Children 3 is lined up and ready to go, thanks to a recent birthday, and I have a feeling The Ice Monster will be on the Christmas list. So thank you, David Walliams, for helping to make a reader of my little girl. And for, along the way, encouraging her to eat her peas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a095152b340ec875aed77906c4b3a46c183635e1/0_310_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1819efbdd96e76ded4743953808b2e84","title":"benefits system could be branded cruel and inhuman by un rapporteur","story":"Philip Alston has completed an audit into austerity in Britain and is preparing his reportThe United Nations’ expert on extreme poverty and human rights has said he is considering whether to brand the UK’s benefits sanctions regime “cruel and inhuman”, following a two-week audit into the impact of austerity in Britain over the last decade.The UN rapporteur, Philip Alston, is preparing what is expected to be a hard-hitting report following a months-long investigation of poverty in Britain which ended with a 10-day tour of some of the poorest areas of the UK.It follows previous audits by Alston in Ghana, Mauritania, China and the United States. He visited some of the poorest neighbourhoods in Newcastle, Glasgow, Belfast, Essex and London and met people who had seen their benefits sanctioned under welfare reforms, some of whom had been left without enough money for food and heating.“Whether I characterise it as cruel and inhuman, I will see how I feel on Thursday night when I am finishing writing my statement,” he told an audience of fellow human rights lawyers and activists at his final public event this week. “I am aware that many of the people who have experienced those sanctions have characterised them in that way.”Alston said he heard “some pretty horrendous stories” about how disabled people are faring under the new universal credit system, and described the poor as “easy victims”.“Attacking the poor is easy and they as a result suffer highly disproportionately in terms of their civil and political rights,” he said.Alston is considered one of the world’s leading legal experts in the field of economic and social rights and is expected to spell out his view on the impact of austerity, local government cuts, universal credit and the possible impact of Brexit on poverty in Britain. He will also report on automation within the benefits system, aided by new technologies such as artificial intelligence.He has a reputation as a strident critic, becoming embroiled last year in a public row with the Trump White House which he accused of pursuing policies that deliberately forced millions of Americans into financial ruin while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy.The UN rapporteur has no direct power, but is considered an influential voice by many supporters of human rights.“If the report is weak it will disappear and sink like a stone,” he said. “Let’s see what happens in this case.”Koldo Casla – policy director of Just Fair, which campaigns for economic and social rights in the UK – said the visit was already a success because it has “created unprecedented interest in media and civil society and, more importantly, among people with direct experience of living in poverty”.“We are eager to read and use his final report in a few months, but the most significant contribution is that Alston has listened carefully and has been a loudspeaker for hundreds of people that are too often paid very little attention to,” he said.Alston held meetings with government ministers in London who told him “there wasn’t austerity”, he said. He met Esther McVey, who resigned as work and pensions secretary on Thursday.He asked what Theresa May was talking about when she said she wanted to end austerity if it didn’t exist. “I didn’t get a particularly good answer to that,” he said.He also said he had received “very surprising responses on the part of government to food banks”.Alston appears likely to make clear that austerity has been a political choice and highlight how Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told him the devolved government in Edinburgh has been spending £125m to mitigate the effects of cuts.In 1976, the UK signed a UN treaty agreeing to protect economic and social rights, but has proved hostile to enshrining it in law.Alston described himself as a “fanatic” who believes economic and social rights “are of the utmost importance”. If they were incorporated into law, as they are in Sweden and Germany, it would require a radical rebalancing of public service finance, probably in favour of more taxes and higher spending.He said there would be “hilarity or disbelief” in government if he suggested incorporation into law, so he is unlikely to push for that.He will issue a short report of about 10 pages on Friday before making a fuller report to the UN’s human rights council in Geneva in June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fc6430a02e370e941261a965a1494d93a23c026/1046_770_1898_1139/master/1898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50394b0a1fef99894f2f1c2cd39dcda6","title":"uk bank urged justify staggering level branch closures which survey","story":"Britain’s leading consumer group has called on banks to justify nearly 13,000 bank branch closures that have left millions of people struggling to access vital financial services across the UK.Figures compiled by the consumer charity Which? show that the UK has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches over the past 30 years, from 20,583 in 1988 to 7,586 today.Thinly-populated areas of Scotland account for 70 of the communities farthest from a branch, though Which? said the south-west and east of England had been “disproportionately affected” given the size of regional populations.Among the towns and villages now lacking a single bank branch are Lymm in Cheshire, Sturminster Newton in Dorset, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Broseley in Shropshire.Ceri Stanaway, money editor for Which?, said: “The true scale of bank branch closures in recent decades is staggering and has left millions of people struggling to access the vital financial services and cash that they need.“For many there is simply no substitute for a dedicated branch and the wide range of services it offers, and many customers now face having to travel long distances if they are to avoid financial exclusion.”Banks including RBS, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds have significantly reduced their bank branch footprint in recent years in an effort to cut costs amid a digital banking push. Those lenders have turned to the Post Office to offset closures, with postmasters across 11,547 sites offering basic transaction services in their stead.Post Office sites are also restricted in the services they can offer, with customers unable to open or close accounts, transfer money between accounts, request a debit card replacement or make a complaint about their bank.Stanaway said: “We want to see banks properly justifying the reasons for closure and taking into account their customers’ needs before shutting their doors – and their customers out.”The Post Office said in a statement that it took its responsibility “very seriously” and was “uniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country”.But Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Post Office should be “doing more, to both improve its small business banking offer and make more firms aware of it”.He added that bank branches were still “vital” to small business owners in areas where internet services were still lagging, or whose customers preferred to pay cash.“Bank branch closures damage high street footfall, restrict cashflow in local economies and force business owners to waste time travelling to and from their next nearest branch, which could be miles away.“Yes, small business owners need to consider alternative ways to bank, but the sheer pace of branch closures is frightening. Firms need time to adjust.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253f9fa13b1178a4a93c457f539bee2fc4fe3706/0_0_5340_3204/master/5340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f30f8eb0056ce0cef74ce3f5356ce8d3","title":"brexit theresa may deal withdrawal agreement nicky morgan","story":"There are many paradoxes in the whole Brexit process. And one of them is that my MP colleagues who now say they will use the “meaningful” vote in the Commons on the proposed withdrawal agreement to vote against it objected so strongly when 11 of us rebelled against the government in 2017 to secure that vote. As I know to my personal cost, that rebellion led to a torrent of abuse, threats of violence and deselection for the 11 Conservative “mutineers”.And now, nearly 12 months later, that vote is almost upon us. We often hear how important votes in the House of Commons are, but this one really, really matters.We live in a representative democracy. Each MP has to vote as a representative, thinking each time about the implications of how they vote for their constituency and constituents. Sometimes those votes and the decisions are easier than others. This time we owe it to our constituents to think extremely long and hard before we cast our vote in December on the withdrawal agreement and the outline of a future relationship with the EU.We owe it to them to read the 585-page draft agreement and the evolving future framework declaration. We owe it to them to talk to a wide selection of our constituents, not just our local party members and supporters, and to remember that for every standard letter campaign there are thousands of local residents who don’t contact us. What do they think? Do they want us to “just get on with it”? This is what I hear most frequently as I talk locally.We owe it to those who elected us to speak to local employers, local charities who have benefited from European Union funding, local students and others who want to continue to have the option of working, studying and travelling around Europe in the future. And we should definitely speak to the EU citizens living in our constituencies and those constituents married to, or with family members who are, EU citizens.The vote will then arrive and we will have to explain the choice we make – that day, at the next election and long into the future, because the vote and what happens next will determine the UK’s place in the world and our relationship with Europe for decades to come. And after a weekend spent remembering the enormous sacrifice of our predecessors as they fought and died over a ided Europe, these issues have added poignancy. Our debates should be long and impassioned. I’d be worried if we weren’t passionate about something so important.Some of us have extra responsibilities. I am working with the Treasury select committee, of which I am chair, to secure a government economic analysis of the longer‑term impact of the proposals and an analysis by the Bank of England of the shorter-term implications of what has been agreed. We will take evidence from ministers, regulators, economists, businesses and others on that analysis. I want all MPs to have both the analysis and our conclusions on it before they vote. I know other select committees will be doing the same in their respective areas.And we will have to explain the alternatives of not approving this withdrawal agreement to our constituents. On Wednesday night I received an email from a lady who said she was a strong remain campaigner (as I was) and wanted me to reject the deal. The trouble with that is that the most likely alternative is we leave the EU with no deal at all. And I believe that would be deeply damaging to our economy and our constituents. I cannot sign up to that.For me the ability to mitigate the damage caused by Brexit is best measured in protecting the jobs and financial security of my constituents. No deal was ever going to be perfect. No side in a negotiation ever gets its own way. It would have been better if the prime minister had been honest about this in 2016 and not allowed people to think a Lancaster House-style Brexit was even remotely deliverable.There are 650 people in this country who now need to do their jobs. We need to act as representatives of our constituents and not on the basis of our personal ideologies or preferences. UK politics has been in a holding pattern since June 2016. We have to move on. We have many, many pressing issues that we need ministers and civil servants, no longer quite so distracted by Brexit, to tackle.And we can only do that if we approve the withdrawal agreement, however imperfect it may be, so we can move forward as a country.• Nicky Morgan is the Conservative MP for Loughborough"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141ebb6fef0832b84dfff71fff87e3037be70ce0/0_116_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d29c33b1ec49d90541fa3f14068552df","title":"steve bannon oxford union","story":"The invitation of this far-right has-been is titillation dressed up as freedom of speech. It shows how out of touch the union isIn recent days, there was a rumour going around the University of Oxford that a major speaker was to be announced at the Oxford Union. When it was revealed on Wednesday morning that the mysterious figure was Steve Bannon, few were surprised. The invitation was a predictably out-of-touch move by an institution that was once renowned for its impactful and passionate debates but is now more commonly visited by professional footballers, comedians on publicity tours and extremists looking for establishment credentials.In his reasoning for the invite, the president of the union, Stephen Horvath, presented the standard, free-speech argument that “it is only through listening to the opinions of others that we can fully understand those opinions”. The idea being that a group of university students would be able to hold fascism to account through a one-hour debate on a Friday afternoon.But the argument – that we should listen to those on the far right because of the insight they can offer into modern populist politics – does not fly in Bannon’s case.Since his departure as Donald Trump’s chief strategist in 2017, Bannon’s significance has seen a steep decline. His audiences at the Oxford Union and at a BBC Scotland event on Wednesday will be far higher than he has become accustomed to recently: only 38 people attended one of his events in New York earlier this year, and photos of empty rooms quietly listening to Bannon have become commonplace on social media.In the Oxford Union event biography – which is remarkably neutral, for a man who views Tommy Robinson as the “backbone of this country” – his new political project, the Movement, is mentioned. It is described as a group trying to “promote rightwing economic nationalism in Europe ahead of the European parliamentary elections in 2019”. But don’t worry if you haven’t heard of it – it hasn’t amounted to much. Bannon, along with his European coordinator, Mischaël Modrikamen, has been rejected by many of the parties he aims to support. In a joint press conference last month held by the National Rally’s Marine Le Pen and Italy’s far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini, the former dismissed Bannon’s offer of help, saying: “Bannon is not European. He is American.” And in August, Alternative for Germany (AfD) – whose leader was also invited to the Oxford Union last month but had to cancel because of “security concerns” that had nothing to do with the mass protest organised against her – also rejected the Movement, saying: “We’re not in America.”So Bannon is no longer significant in US politics, and so far his attempts to gain notoriety in Europe are floundering. So why has the Oxford Union invited him? The answer is saddening and obvious – it’s for the excitement. Leaders of the union are titillated by the idea of having someone like Bannon speak at their institution. His invitation, and the complete denial of its problematic nature, gives an insight into this institution that has provided the starting point for many of our political leaders’ careers. They take joy in turning up week after week decked out in white tie to play at parliamentary politics for a few hours. And their political games have a real-life impact – the Boris Johnson-Michael Gove Tory leadership fight in 2016 came straight from the halls of the Oxford Union.The Bannon invitation is yet another example of an institution that serves no real purpose apart from churning out politicians who care more about the game than its result.

Since then, we’ve won four referendums (which under Swiss electoral law are frequent) against the rightwing populists. How did we do that? We fought tooth and nail to defend the institutions that protect our freedom and the rule of law. We believed in our goals. And we decided to never sing the populist’s song – only our own song.For more than two decades Switzerland has been something of a laboratory for rightwing populism. Ahead of others in Europe, the rightwing Swiss People’s party deployed a relentless anti-immigrant, anti-EU rhetoric. It has successfully used referendums as a marketing tool for its political agenda and has become the largest political force in Switzerland.I am 27, and a history student. This was the political environment I grew up in. But in February 2014, my friends and I experienced a kind of Brexit shock before Brexit happened: a “mass immigration initiative” – a referendum – spearheaded by the populists put our country’s relations with the EU at risk. It was a wake-up call. A small group of us in our 20s decided we’d had enough, and it was time to do something.We were fed up with the passivity of Switzerland’s established parties. We were angry that traditional political forces were on the defensive in front of the populists, and that no one was speaking up for the very institutions that have made our country so successful in the last two centuries. We felt the need to get involved, to stand up proudly for Switzerland as a land of opportunity, not as an open-air museum – a country of ersity, with a positive narrative for liberal ideas.Our crowdfunded, volunteer-based campaigning has achieved a lot in the last four years. We defeated the Swiss People’s party in four major referendum battles: on the question of expelling foreigners who have broken the law (February 2016), on providing legal support for asylum seekers (June 2016), on naturalisation (February 2017) and on the abolition of the country’s public broadcasting (March 2018).Right now we’re busy campaigning in the run-up to another referendum, on 25 November, in which the populists aim to place Swiss legislation above international law – in essence a “Switzerland first” agenda. The vote could result in Switzerland’s withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights. I’d like to share what we’ve learned along the way.To tackle rightwing populism, you have to dispense with peevishness and be very much on the offensive – you must lead the narrative. Take, for example, the 2016 referendum asking Swiss citizens whether they’d agree to have foreigners expelled on the grounds of even minor offenses, such as driving too fast twice in a 10-year period. The vote aimed at modifying the constitution to allow a system of automatic expulsions from the country, with judges given no room to consider personal hardship – an essential element of the law. These changes could have potentially targeted people born in Switzerland who had never lived in the country their parents came from.So what we did is this: we entirely avoided speaking about foreigners and criminality. Instead, we set the tone of the debate by speaking out about the rule of law and how important it is that everyone be equal before it. We moved the political battlefield and forced our adversaries to meet us there. We deliberately argued in a patriotic way, repeatedly referring to the constitution as a pillar of our liberal democracy. In this way, we removed the rightwing populist’s ability to dictate what “their” referendum was about and demonstrated that the changes being considered would affect everyone, not just “criminal foreigners” – as the populists put it.And it worked. As the vote drew close, the Swiss People’s party shifted away from the topic of “criminal foreigners”. They found themselves having to explain why they wanted Swiss values to be upended. This was a reversal. People took notice. After the results came out, the leader of the populist’s party conceded: “I don’t know what happened but at some point, everyone was just talking about the rule of law.”As the 2019 European parliamentary elections approach, the task for liberal-minded pro-Europeans is to capture the initiative and be the first to define what that election is really about. As a Swiss citizen and a stout liberal democrat, I care immensely about the EU’s fate. Next year’s vote will be about the shape and values of the continent we want to live in. It is very much about freedom and opportunities – not about migration or identity.Let’s not be intimidated by rightwing populists. Let them explain why they want to attack institutions and values that brought decades of peace, freedom and prosperity to Europe. Let them explain why we should dismantle that model.Europeans need to show pride in institutions that exist because of what we’ve learned from the past. It’s true that many citizens don’t relate to these institutions and often don’t understand what they stand for – which brings me to another crucial point: politics needs to speak directly to people’s hearts and minds. Populists don’t have a monopoly on emotions. Liberalism is based on emotions too. It is based on the profound belief that freedom and equal rights are necessary for any society to prosper as a whole.That’s where the battle lies. Serious democrats across Europe have a responsibility to ensure that a vast majority of citizens understand and connect emotionally to what truly protects them – liberal institutions. Now is the time to sing that song – and proudly so.• Flavia Kleiner is co-founder of Operation Libero, a grassroots liberal democratic movement in Switzerland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88700334bda4dd9d0eabf9e079e377d698312d90/0_225_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edb550c7f3ef4aaa9b08a7bdca1c817d","title":"the guardian view on a tory brexit irreconcilable differences","story":"Few prime ministers have taken the pummelling that Theresa May has endured, especially since she published her blueprint for Britain’s relationship with the EU in July. The Chequers plan, as it was known, was pronounced dead by the EU two months later in Salzburg. Mrs May was then sent back to rework her proposals, a humiliation in the eyes of her party that she has not lived down. Since then, the prime minister has been viewed with condescension, even contempt, by her own MPs. It has often appeared that Mrs May leads a party that has taken leave of its senses. This week, Mrs May produced a plan, acceptable to continental capitals, for the two-year transition period when Britain leaves the EU. This has finally tipped large sections of the Tory party over the edge.Two cabinet ministers have resigned as well as a raft of junior ones. MPs from the hardline European Research Group are busy tweeting pictures of letters demanding that Mrs May goes. Her difficulty is that few people seem to be impressed by her or her Brexit plan: not the left of her party (who consider her proposals to be an inferior position to the status quo) nor its right (who reject it for falling short of their fantasy). Over three hours at the dispatch box this morning, it became obvious that the deal Mrs May struck with the EU is dead. Her platform would be one that any challenger would run against. Mrs May finds no support from the opposition benches or from the Democratic Unionist party.The end is nigh for this phase of British politics. Mrs May might survive a leadership challenge to limp on. Her plan certainly will not. In facing down rebels, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act constrains Mrs May. She can no longer turn votes into issues of confidence that, if lost, would trigger an election. She cannot just go on losing votes. MPs will eventually have to be allowed to vote on alternatives, which might include whether to have a softer – or a harder – Brexit deal than Mrs May has secured whether a general election ought to be held and even whether or not to endorse a second referendum. To stave off such thoughts, Mrs May says the only other option is for Britain to “leave with no deal”. If politicians ought to have learned anything since 2016 it surely must be that the country is not in a mood to be scared into submission.This points to a feature not a bug in Brexit: untamed nationalism is a powerfully destructive force. A decade ago, the largely sublimated Euroscepticism of the Conservative party began to break through. The veteran Europhile grandee Ken Clarke began featuring as the most rebellious Tory MP. This has led to fantasy. Brexiters, wrongly, have argued that leaving Europe is a way to restore Britain’s greatness. The nationalist vote against the EU, say leavers, was not to shrink the UK. Rather, they claim, Brexit Britain ought to play a role in the world independent of Europe, not lost within it. As Mrs May put it, Britain voted “to leave the European Union and embrace the world ... to build a truly global Britain”. This is poppycock. The EU is a force multiplier for this country. In leaving, Britain will almost certainly be a diminished and angrier place.With just four months to Brexit this is not the time for a protracted Conservative leadership contest. What prevents a speedy contest is that there is no consensus over a post-May Brexit strategy. A ided party cannot guide this nation out of the EU. It is delusional to think leaving Europe will immediately boost the economy. The Tories risk repelling voters living in Britain’s most dynamic regions. The Tories had largely contained their European passions in informal factions. The problem is that Euroscepticism is an ideology rooted in abstract ideas, not in experience. Being in Europe encouraged trust, reciprocity and good behaviour. Falling out risks the opposite. The Conservative party has stayed intact for almost the whole of the past century, imbibing the crucial lesson of Labour’s traumatic experience in the 1980s – that any splinter party would disappear in the remorseless logic of the electoral system. Parties do experience rifts. But Brexit is turning these into an existential fight for the soul of the Tory party, with Britain as collateral damage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a533ea1d6c1d2d4e3d7adbcb56b92dc567c01114/0_0_2076_1246/master/2076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c766bac80624db9963359885c7927113","title":"theresa may brexit running out of road","story":"Her face was as impossible to read as ever. Theresa May betrayed so little of her emotions as she emerged from Downing Street to unveil her Brexit deal on Wednesday night that with the sound off, you wouldn’t have known if she was resigning or declaring peace in our time.But perhaps she didn’t quite know herself. Only minutes earlier, her Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, had told the Conservative chief whip that he would be quitting, although his resignation was only formally accepted the next morning. She must have known this fragile truce couldn’t hold, that cabinet ministers who had lost the fight inside the room were now taking it outside. This was a prime minister with power slipping through her fingers.Yet even in what may be her last days in office, May still has her uniquely stultifying ability to drain a moment of its drama. Ministers sometimes complain that she chairs cabinet meetings, rather than leading them that her own views remain oddly opaque. There was a flavour of exactly that detachment when she came to parliament on Thursday morning. With ministers dropping like flies, she didn’t even try to pretend this was the deal anybody had wanted, although it does at least tick the boxes of ending freedom of movement and minimising economic disruption. Rather, she wanted the nation to know that she had done her best in trying circumstances, and if some felt it wasn’t good enough then that was regrettable but – well, there it was. The overall air was of a postwoman plodding through a blizzard, just trying to deliver what the people had ordered, as if her own feelings barely mattered. And perhaps, in a way, they don’t.Years ago, when May first started being seriously discussed as a future leader, Europe was the one issue on which even her closest political allies couldn’t be sure where she stood. The best they could offer was that she didn’t seem terribly interested. (There is a ring of truth to former aide Nick Timothy’s charge that deep down she never believed Brexit could work, although he is wrong to suggest that if only she had believed harder in fairies everything would have worked out if anything, she merely comes across as rather more in touch with reality than he was.)But whatever she feels deep down, it is not the May way to emote, any more than it is to inspire. She prevails by grinding people down, wearing them out, pointing out the lack of a better alternative it’s how she became leader in the first place, how she has survived despite her party’s misgivings, and evidently how she will now seek to stave off the attempted leadership challenge now under way. This time she could hardly get away with pretending that nothing had changed, but the message was that nothing will be changing the deal is the deal. Her best hope is to persuade her party that anything is better than the risk of accidentally installing Jacob Rees-Mogg in Downing Street, before somehow trying to sell her unloved deal to the nation on the grounds that at least this way everyone will know where they stand and Brexit will be over. The British people, she insisted at an almost unnaturally calm press conference, just want her to “get on with it”. Perhaps she is banking on what the academic Rob Ford calls “Brexhaustion”, or the fact that for every man or woman glued to every twist and turn there is probably one who barely cares now how this thing ends, just so long as it ends.Yet that end now looks a very long way off indeed. There is something almost wickedly disingenuous about continuing to pretend, at this moment of great national jeopardy, that with the right person in charge we could swiftly extract a deal offering exactly the same advantages as EU membership but with none of the tiresome obligations. It is no more credible that Jeremy Corbyn, a man who can barely get through a TV interview over Brexit without contradicting his own party’s policy, could pull this mythical sword from the stone than that Boris Johnson or Rees-Mogg could.If negotiations have truly reached a stalemate, then stopping the clock on article 50 and throwing the ball back to the people in a second referendum arguably seems the fairest way forward. Having never personally been convinced of the case for a people’s vote, nonetheless I’d bite your arm off for one if it’s a choice of that or crashing out without a deal, a scenario in which the health secretary apparently cannot guarantee that lives would not be lost. The more real the prospect of no deal becomes, the more pressing the case for seeking consent, no matter how resistant both May and Corbyn are to the idea.But let’s not pretend that the outcome of a second referendum would necessarily be any more welcome than the last one, that the losing side would be any more reconciled to defeat, or that we wouldn’t spend the next 10 years arguing about who lied and cheated. And before we get to any of that, the last act of the Tory psychodrama must first play itself out. May is not just running out of road on Brexit. Relations with the DUP, which won’t back her deal, have descended into the deep freeze amid mutterings of private promises betrayed. She surely can’t rely on their votes now to drive through whatever tattered fragments of her domestic policy are left.Desperation to keep the Brexit show on the road is now bending the rest of government out of shape, with rumours of policy and spending decisions being twisted to keep restless ministers on board. She could see off the Rees-Mogg charge but survive only as a puppet leader, her strings jerked by any Brexiter willing to stay in cabinet – a deal Michael Gove seems to have initially offered her. It seems unlikely that any domestic legacy of her own could be salvaged from such wreckage.But if her premiership has been sorely lacking in imagination at times, by taking the referendum result so literally she has at least provided a moment of dreadful clarity about the consequences. Tory Brexiters demanded the impossible. Well, now they have it a deal impossible to get through parliament, impossible to sell to leave voters so cynically led to expect something better. If nothing else, history will surely remember her more kindly than either the architects of leave or her predecessor, David Cameron, whose catastrophic error of judgment landed us in this mess. They broke it, but she owned it, which explains the odd note of pity that creeps in when her name crops up in conversations beyond Westminster. It may now be for someone else to glue the pieces back together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8391641df8131732eac76cb24d04e44aa32bab37/544_395_4481_2688/master/4481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3082664f1cd224dbde92a614fe484267","title":"theresa may tory mps single market customs union government brussels","story":"The prime minister always told us that no deal is better than a bad deal. She has tried her best to negotiate a good deal, but has ended up with a very bad deal. What is on offer entails the United Kingdom agreeing to pay the European Union another £39bn, in return for 21 months or more of additional talks to see if a new partnership can be arranged. Why would the EU be more willing to offer preferential trade terms and other benefits once we have agreed to pay it a large sum of money, when over the past two years and four months it has not been prepared to do so?The EU has made it crystal clear that, if a country wants to stay in the customs union and single market, it has to obey all the rules and laws of the EU and cannot enter into new free trade deals with other countries on its own initiative. The EU thinks that if you belong to the single market you have to make budget contributions and accept freedom of movement.The 17.4 million leave voters fully understood that Brexit meant leaving the single market and customs union as well as the EU: both remain and leave campaigns told them that was so, and the EU agreed the government also said we would have to leave the single market and customs union. The deal on offer does not respect this, keeping the UK in both the single market and customs union for another 21 months, with further commitments thereafter if a full partnership agreement has not been reached in the meantime.Why would the EU hasten to agree a new partnership when it would, under this deal, have the UK locked in as a member of the customs union with no unilateral right to leave? Under this deal, the UK would renounce the EU treaty it can get out of and substitute it with another treaty that has no clear exit. It would also mean no vote and voice over the laws and rules that would apply to us – a worsening of the position of being a member, where we had some influence despite often being outvoted.The prime minister is unlikely to be able to get the complex legislation through the Commons given the large number of opponents on the Conservative and DUP benches. Labour has made clear its opposition to this measure as well. Strong Conservative remain supporters are as opposed to it as pro-Brexit MPs.The bill to authorise this treaty will be complex because the draft treaty is complex. It would also be a case of take it all or leave it, as the government will have no independent ability to compromise or flex given it is an agreement with the 27 other member states.So what should the government do? It should return to the EU and explain that the draft treaty is unacceptable to the UK parliament, whose authority is needed to sign it. The government should accept the EU’s position that we cannot be half in and half out of the single market and customs union. It should table a free trade agreement between an independent UK and the EU to start next March.The EU has offered this for Great Britain but not for the whole of the UK. The government, therefore, has to revisit all the work done on the Irish border issue, and show that the UK need not introduce new fences, control posts and barriers. The border is already a VAT, excise and currency border, and can handle customs dues as well without big delays and difficult intrusions.Meanwhile, it needs to complete its preparations for leaving next March without signing a withdrawal agreement, given the likelihood that parliament won’t approve this one.This agreement suits neither side, so it is time to negotiate a better one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad7fec63f356441282dfffecf2598dd51079e4f/0_0_3827_2305/master/3827.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301661c59cfa60b61fb401035a144430 685w","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

Among them was 60s fashion model, photographer and long-time Quant fan Jill Kennington, who chose to wear a striped, woollen Quant dress for the occasion. “It honestly could be today’s fashion,” she said. “I love Mary Quant and I always did. She opened the door to fashion for youth. There was nothing, really, before Mary. It’s great that she’s being honoured by the V\u0026ampA because she deserves that.”The event also featured a replica version of Quant’s “beauty bus”. The open-topped Routemaster then travelled to the King’s Road, home of Quant’s first store, Bazaar. Go-go dance troupe the Meyer Dancers performed to songs of the 60s wearing black and white Quant-inspired outfits.The exhibition follows the museum’s callout to the public in June, in which the V\u0026ampA sought to track down rare items of Quant clothing, receiving over 800 responses. The objects and stories since unearthed have informed the “exhibition narrative”, which will focus on the years between 1955 and 1975. Visitors to the exhibition will find more than 120 garments, as well as accessories, cosmetics, sketches and photographs belonging to Quant, most of which have never been displayed before. Quant is synonymous with some of the era-defining styles of the 60s – namely the miniskirt. Emerging alongside second-wave feminism, Quant revelled in rule-breaking fashion design and her higher-than-high hemlines are still very much associated with the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movement.“We really dissect the story of the miniskirt, how it evolved and who was responsible for it taking over fashion,” said co-curator Jenny Lister. “The exhibition also goes through to the 70s, when she ersified into other projects like cosmetics, tights, underwear and even raincoats.”Quant was also known for her colourful tights and tailored trousers, as well as for being someone who personified her distinctive brand.“We want to bring to life the stories of the people who wore the clothes,” says Lister. “It’s not just about fashion being exclusive and expensive, it’s much more achievable – which makes it quite different to fashion exhibitions that we’ve done before.”The exhibition Mary Quant runs from 6 April 2019 – 16 February 2020.

They talk about whether feminism is to blame for encouraging women to wait before reproducing – and why their film shouldn’t be dismissed as a chick flickEleven years ago, the director Tamara Jenkins was flying round the world promoting her second film, The Savages. A sad, frank comedy about suddenly caring for a father with Alzheimer’s, it won rave reviews, then Oscar nominations for Jenkins and star Laura Linney.Professionally, life was peachy. Privately, more rotten. Jenkins, who was then 45, and her husband, the screenwriter Jim Taylor, were trying unsuccessfully to start a family. Natural methods seemed a non-starter medical intervention hit a brick wall egg donation was fraught international adoption was swaddled in red tape (no one over a certain age or weight, said China).Her upset was exacerbated by those unfamiliar – and unsympathetic – with artificial reproduction. She was amazed by the vitriol that met an anonymous online IVF diary in the New York Times. “A lot of anger. A million crazy, extremely opinionated, muscular reactions: ‘Oh my God, this is so decadent! This is disgusting! How dare she?’“I was just like, I’m not even gonna hang out with you heterosexuals any more. All gay people who want to have babies have to seek alternative means – they can’t just have sex. They get it.“And so when people say: ‘Why don’t you just adopt?’ I’m like: ‘Shut the fuck up.’ There’s no ‘just’ about it. It’s very hard. It’s very expensive. It’s really intense and really difficult.”She sighs. The woman next to her follows suit, a bit less briskly. The briefness of female fertility is, she chips in sympathetically, “a bummer. It’s just a real, real pickle.”This is Kathryn Hahn, everybody’s favourite vaguely-under-the-radar actor, expert scene-stealer in Parks and Recreation, Bad Moms, Transparent and a dozen mainstream comedies, lately graduating to leads in the likes of I Love Dick. She is also the star of one of the two great things to have emerged from Jenkins’ years of grief (the first being Mia, born in 2010 after IVF finally came through).Private Life, Jenkins’ third film, is exceptional: a very funny and moving portrait of a wobbling midlife marriage. Hahn is Rachel, a novelist in her early 40s who lives in a grotty bit of New York with a struggling theatre director, Richard (Paul Giamatti). A round of IVF using Rachel’s eggs fails. The couple have been badly burned by attempts to adopt. Rachel balks at the idea of an egg donor. But then Richard’s charming, 20-year-old step-niece stays with them for a while – and the future begins to look brighter.After decades of cinema conspicuous for crass, gaffe-strewn IVF references, Private Life’s compassion and accuracy are remarkable. Revelatory, too, for those unfamiliar with such matters in the United States, where donation is much less regulated. “It’s a little wild west,” says Jenkins. “There are ads saying: ‘Hey, I went to Harvard and Yale and my SAT scores are amazing and my eggs are $50,000.’”In the film, Richard and Rachel scroll through sites of prospective donors trying to work out whose genes they fancy. “I spoke to some women who had been there,” says Hahn, “and they said they considered themselves feminists but they would just immediately objectify a woman’s thumbnail image and biography. ‘How beautiful is she? Where did she go to school? How tall is she? What does she look like?’”They laugh: agog and jolly. On screen, Hahn is often the unkempt muddle in a more groomed girl gang. Face to face, she is delicate and gentle, respectfully deferential to Jenkins, 11 years her elder and more ball-busting – but also a lot of fun.“I cannot imagine the ache of having to carry such pain,” says Hahn. “What it does to marriages, to people to feel they’ve been betrayed by their biology, to see people continue getting what you want, to feel you are being left behind.” Her eyes well up and she clutches her tum. “To feel like you are mourning little deaths in private, to have this sort of shame-cloak around you.”Hahn herself dutifully followed her own mother’s advice not to have children in her 20s. Anyway, before she became pregnant 10 years ago, at 35, “I didn’t have the money. I didn’t have the health insurance. I didn’t have the desire at all. I was a freelancer. I was too self-involved, I was trying to figure out who I was.”Jenkins’ ambivalence was more rigid. “I had thousands of reasons, like my own shitty family, my terrible relationship with my mother. I never had any dreams of weddings and babies. I was so butch. Then, cut to me being married and desperate to have a baby.” A sip of coffee. “You don’t really know who you are until things that you must take for granted are not available to you.”Second-wave feminism is culpable, they agree, for lulling women into a false sense of fertility. Ditto selective media reporting. “You read in People magazine about celebrities having babies at 49,” says Jenkins. “And nobody’s saying: ‘Well, it’s probably not her eggs and it cost her $87,000 and years of heartbreak.’ It’s fucked up. It’s not the full story. And no one should have to publicly share all this. But when people say: ‘Oh my God, we were just so lucky,’ you’re like, ‘No, you weren’t lucky – you spent a lot of money.’ Which is fine, but it’s very confusing.”The majority of IVF cycles end in tears and limbo. This reality is also suppressed. “I remember reading memoirs about fertility stuff,” says Jenkins, “and sometimes the end was that they went and had sex with their husband and got pregnant. Well, fuck you! I never wanted the film to end like that.”Yet Private Life’s rejection of a tidy resolution has frustrated some. At Q\u0026ampAs in the US, says Jenkins, there has sometimes been “a kind of unsettledness with the fact they are not being told how to metabolise the story exactly. Not being told what to feel can make people uncomfortable.”Such anxiety, she thinks, taps into the existential dread that underpins infertility. “If Paul and Kathryn’s characters don’t have a child, then marking time is watching the other person die. Whereas when you have a child, you’re watching something thrive. It’s such an enormous distraction from your own mortality. You’re so focused on that life you’re trying to help you’re not looking at yourself.”And it is this – more than the gags and performances and not cocking up details – that makes Private Life so good: it uses infertility as a lens to look at so much more. It is also why its director is getting increasingly frustrated by its billing. “It’s not just a women’s infertility comedy. It’s about survival. It’s about humanity. It’s about growing. It’s about mortality. It’s about gentrification.”Yet by dint of Jenkins’ gender, as much as the film’s subject matter, “it’s dismissed as domestic and small and a chick thing. I just feel kind of sick of it. As I get older, I’m so fatigued by the feeling that the main thing is men’s work. How often do female stories get brought to the centre of the discussion or the culture? If they do, it’s one a year.”After all, she continues, many masterpieces have infertility at their core, but aren’t marginalised on account of it. “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is about an infertile couple. Their twisted secret is that they have this fake baby. But nobody says: ‘Oh, yeah, the infertility play.’ It’s just one of the great American plays.” She shrugs in frustration. “I know my film is different. But if Edward Albee was Edwina Albee, I wonder if that still would have happened.”• Private Life is on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/286597b0d02c20ab2f025cbd368a67543f9df78b/0_164_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5b1e4f5a07d6af0779a03937785492c","title":"the 20 best marvel films ranked","story":"Following the death of Stan Lee – comic-book titan and prolific creator – we examine the screen adaptations of some of Marvel’s greatest characters. Excelsior!No list of Marvel films – or of any films – can be without Nicolas Cage. Here he plays the terrifying Ghost Rider. By day: stunt motorbike rider Johnny Blaze. By night: a flaming skeleton forced by Satan to ride around collecting souls for hell on his lethal chopper.There is something funny, understated and self-deprecatory in the superpowers of Ant-Man – chiefly an ability to get really, really small – and Paul Rudd was perfectly cast in this likable Marvel movie, originally written by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. Like many Marvel films with a more obvious comic touch, it has grown in retrospect.Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were in their late 20s when they played Peter Parker, but Tom Holland was just 21 when he made his bashful Spidey debut in Captain America: Civil War. As a result, he was instantly more credible as a high-school kid, coming under the wisecracking mentorship of Tony Stark. Holland has been absolutely great in the role since, instantly getting Marvel’s verbal and physical language of dynamic, yet self-aware superheroism.Time-travel was a complicating factor in this X-Men movie – perhaps too much so – but it at least brought us Evan Peters’s Quicksilver, who features in the glorious “bullet-time” sequence, in which the lightning-fast teenager ambles around catching bullets in the air as they are shot towards Magneto and Prof Xavier, all set to Jim Croce’s yearningly melancholicTime In a Bottle.Sam Raimi made a splash with this, the first of his original trio, and he persuaded a new generation to love Spider-Man as the existential underdog, the winner who is also a loser. Filmed before 911 but released afterwards, Raimi had to junk a spectacular shot of a helicopter being caught in webbing strung between the two WTC towers, along with much contingent narrative.The casting of Robert Downey Jr as the central pillar of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was very important – his quicksilver wit and his handsomeness, salted with cynicism and bleariness, allowed the films a crucial difference in tone and feel to previous superhero movies, giving them a new kind of savvy comedy. The first Iron Man, directed by John Favreau, isn’t my favourite, but it was a vital foundation of Marvel’s filmic cosmos.For sheer grandeur and a very literate, almost Shakespearean sense of cosmic power politics, director Kenneth Branagh gave us a very enjoyable drama centred on the great deity Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth. He has issues with his father, Odin, played – perhaps inevitably – by Anthony Hopkins. Tom Hiddleston played his malcontent evil brother, Loki, in the great tradition of Jeremy Irons’s Uncle Scar in The Lion King. The giant universal vistas of Asgard, Jotunheim and Earth are created with surreal brio.Doctor Strange is the most avowedly, even pedantically freaky hero in the MCU: the statutory Stan Lee cameo has the great man on a city bus, chuckling over a copy of Aldous Huxley’s Doors of Perception – the closest a Marvel film will come to actually advocating drug abuse. Benedict Cumberbatch cemented his unique A-list status as Dr Stephen Strange, the wealthy and temperamental neurosurgeon who is terribly injured in a car crash, but then ascends to a higher level of psychokinetic mastery thanks to Tilda Swinton’s Ancient One. The landscape-folding moments of surreality are more lightly managed than in Christopher Nolan’s Inception.A fascinatingly downbeat movie from the Marvel canon: superpowers are one thing, but no-one said the chracters were immortal. So, what happens when superheroes get old? This film goes some way towards an answer with this tale of Logan: X-Men’s Wolverine – seen at some stage in future, making an incognito living as a limo driver while caring for a decrepit Charles Xavier, and enduring severe pain every time his claws are unsheathed.In the great bible of Marvel, the cataclysmic Avengers: Infinity War is the nearest to the Book of Revelations. It’s the closest the franchise comes to actually showing us the awful reality of an end to everything – that unthinkable final curtain the mighty battles between good and evil appear to have been gesturing at before now. The management of tone is expert: at one moment tragic, the next funny, and the next just exciting.Marvel humour is at its most studenty and self-aware in this movie about the mutant mercenary assassin who first emerged on screen as a cameo in X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. It’s also very macabre and very funny. Ryan Reynolds is once again Deadpool, the black sheep of the X-Men family.The two great enemies of picnics get co-billing in this hilarious, charming and distinctly lovable film tackling the micro-universe, the second in the Ant-Man series. Paul Rudd is great as Ant-Man and Evangeline Lilly is formidable as the Wasp. Michael Douglas has a certain old-school aplomb as Dr Hank Pym, and Michelle Pfeiffer has a great supporting turn as the Wasp’s mother, Janet van Dyne.This was the first of many X-Men films, and in Bryan Singer it had a director overtaken by controversy, although at the time, the only controversy concerned the film’s extraordinary – or crass – “concentration camp” scene set in Poland in 1944. This was the movie that brought us Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magneto.Not everyone agrees, but my favourite of the Iron Man films is the third – because of the lip-smacking relish brought to the writing and directing by Shane Black, a master of action comedy. Downey Jr is on fine form as the titular mercurial mogul and, in an age when we have to endure Elon Musk and his unwieldy submarine, Stark’s persona seems charm itself.Perhaps this is the quintessential MCU film, which introduced mainstream audiences to the idea of mashing up the lives and existences of superheroes to have them work together and encroach on each other’s adventures while playing everything more or less deadpan. This one teamed Iron Man, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor, Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) – creating a virtual blood-sugar overload of superhero potency. They faced Hiddleston’s outrageously evil Loki. Johansson is superb as Black Widow.Director James Gunn has fallen on his sword for inappropriate tweets, but this hasn’t cancelled the claim his s of the Galaxy movies have on the hearts of Marvel fans. Again, the keynote of comedy is all-important. Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill, the Han-Solo-ish intergalactic freebooter, listening to his retro playlist on an old-school Sony Walkman and commanding a ragtag multi-species crew, a tree-shaped creature called Groot, a huge guy called Drax, a talking raccoon called Rocket and a green alien called Gamora. There is a rush of absurdity, but excitement as well.Sam Raimi’s second film in the original Spider-Man series is often thought the best of the trilogy, and perhaps even the best Marvel film. It’s certainly the most serious, and taps into the melancholy self-questioning of Spider-Man, while Alfred Molina’s Doctor Octopus is still the best Marvel supervillain.This sequel to 1998’s Blade was directed by Guillermo del Toro with a swirling, demonic energy. The story once again concerns the charismatic daywalker, played by Wesley Snipes. It is a delirious Gothic-tech martial arts movie and the fight sequences Del Toro unleashes are horribly exciting. Not a typical superhero film, in many ways, but a great one. This superb film is a deliriously entertaining Afrofuturist adventure, with strange echoes of Rider Haggard. Black Panther was established as one of Marvel’s greatest heroes, and Ryan Coogler’s movie showed that having a nearly non-white cast was not simply a matter of ersity signalling – it was a colossal box office hit across the board, with a richer and more cultish element of fantasy than other Marvel films. (It also boasts MCU’s first woman cinematographer: the Oscar-nominated Rachel Morrison. Marvel Studios’ president, Kevin Feige, has promised to get more women writers and directors on board, with next year’s Captain Marvel co-written and co-directed by Anna Boden. So far, the only Marvel female writing credit is Nicole Perman for s Of The Galaxy.)Somehow the Marvel planets came into alignment more perfectly, more sublimely, with this film than with any other Marvel movie: it is smart, visually exciting and perhaps above all, funny. And it’s funny in a way that only Marvel movies can be, demonstrating that comedy need not undercut or send up the drama, but that it can be an integral part of it. Taika Waititi was an inspired choice as director, and Hemsworth and Cate Blanchett are tremendous as Thor and Hela, the goddess of death who also happens to be Thor’s half-sister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c108eb030e9742f2efd0b95a4b5a830eb88b0f7/0_0_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc65cb8c3e12f594a60ff331ac9bc25d","title":"whos wrecking christmas quality street john lewis pick and mix","story":"British families sublimate seasonal rage through chocolate. Now the pick-and-mix tin is going to tear us apart…Like it or not, Christmas is bearing down upon us. It’s a special time for over-eating, socially sanctioned inebriation and, most importantly, for realising that your immediate family are a bunch of truly appalling, hateful people. T’was ever thus. When I was a kid, growing up with an agony aunt mother who ran her business salving emotional pain and distress from home, the busiest two weeks of the year were always the ones immediately following Christmas. The break stopped families getting away from each other. Cooped up at home because of the weather, crowds of people would end up writing to my mother announcing they now wished to orce their irritating spouses or put their dreadful children up for adoption or both.It could have been worse. For decades, many British families have learned to sublimate their festering rage over the festive period, through the medium of cheap chocolate: in particular, via arguments over the contents of the shared Christmas Quality Street tin. By fighting with each other over who ate all the orange cremes, and why there are only toffee pennies left and for God’s sake, you know exactly how important the green triangles are to me, generations of us have avoided arguing about anything of real importance. We bitch and squabble over crap confectionery and, satisfied that we have somehow made our point, retreat into a fine British position of quiet, sturdy mutual contempt.Well, brace yourselves. Nestlé, the current custodians of the Quality Street brand, have screwed this up. I would go so far as to say that they have risked ruining Christmas for millions of British households. Quality Street functioned as a pressure valve for family antagonism precisely because you never knew exactly what you would get in the tin. This year, Nestlé has created a pick-and-mix system, hosted within every branch of John Lewis. For a mere £15, you can create your own mix of a minimum of three, and a maximum of nine, of their classics. You want only caramel cups, purple ones and toffee pennies? (Ludicrous example. Nobody actually wants the toffee pennies. Apart from my wife. She’s weird.) That’s exactly what you can have. They’ll even print your name on the lid.Worst of all, it’s a massive hit. On a Monday lunchtime, weeks out from the festivities, London’s Oxford Street branch was full of people literally queuing up to destroy their own families from the inside. I went. I did it. I was the one who asked for a three-way split between those caramel cups, purple ones and toffee pennies. I took the tin home. We opened it and were faced by the unhealthiest thing possible: instant gratification. No arguments. No rows. One for me. One for her. One for the youngest. And the stone-cold certainty that without this to fight over, we were going to have to argue about something that actually mattered.There is a bitter irony to it being sold only through dear old John Lewis. The department store is practically regarded as a place of worship for Britain’s godless middle classes a tribe that specifically hates arguments. They want everything to be nice. They would rather pour molten iron on their own feet and stick pins in their eyes than actually say what they really think or feel about each other. And yet, by buying into this latest Quality Street marketing wheeze, this destruction of the traditional way of muddling through, they’re going to end up doing just that. I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but Christmas 2018 is utterly buggered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ff2557c0d6b94a740a98b775db92fd72d1e332/0_103_3064_1838/master/3064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cba845028c786e4e139580985750776","title":"england usa international friendly match report","story":"There were glimpses of a familiar fearlessness, flashbacks to the searing pace generated from a standing start, all stocky power and precocious skill to traumatise markers. Wayne Rooney must have seen his youthful self in Jadon Sancho and, having delighted in a fond farewell, departed this stage convinced the baton has been passed on to worthy successors. This had been billed as his night but, in the end, it was the new generation who dazzled.The former captain’s cameo ultimately amounted to 32 minutes, a period illuminated by one sharp shift on to his left foot to whip away a shot that was claimed, one wonderfully lofted pass for Ruben Loftus-Cheek to gather, and a placed attempt in injury time which so nearly squirmed beyond Brad Guzan only for the goalkeeper to grasp it at full stretch. Rooney’s script did not quite extend to a 54th international goal.It mattered not, and he played out his time with a broad smile creased across his face, and applause for all corners of the arena. “It’s in very safe hands, from what I’ve seen this week,” he offered in the aftermath. “It’s a great group of young players who have a really bright future. I’m sure in the next few years they will go close to bringing a trophy back. I’ve had my time, it was two years since I last played. I’m proud to be the record goalscorer. I can sit back now and watch them. I’ll be one of the fans supporting them.”There is so much from which to draw encouragement at present, regardless of the outcome of Sunday’s mouthwatering winner-takes-all Nations League collision with Croatia, when a victory will see England claim the section. Lose, or even score draw, and they will be relegated, but they will tear into that tie with gusto. Sancho is unlikely to start this weekend, but has now served notice of his blistering talent within the confines of Wembley. The 18-year-old brought all the dynamic form that has thrilled so often for Borussia Dortmund since his brave decision to prioritise first-team football over life on the fringes at an all-conquering Manchester City. Some of the winger’s touches were sublime, his quick feet a blur of tricks and flicks to torment a frazzled back-line. So much for nerves on a first senior start for his country.He will have enjoyed his rat-a-tat passing routines with Rooney as the clock ticked down for the 33-year-old at this level, England’s past and future basking in each other’s company for a brief moment. “Playing with Wayne Rooney was a dream come true,” Sancho said. “He’s a legend and a role model to me. I was a bit nervous ahead of the game and he came over and told me just to express myself because I had nothing to lose.”It had been Sancho’s calm head among panicked opponents inside the visitors’ cluttered penalty area, and carefully weighted pass for an overlapping Trent Alexander-Arnold, which effectively settled the game. The full-back, only just out of his teens himself, ripped a first England goal gloriously across Guzan and inside the far post, becoming the youngest Liverpool player to score for England since Michael Owen in the process.Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli were more senior heads among England’s least experienced lineup in 38 years – 94 caps combined in the starting XI while Rooney was still stuck on 119 among the substitutes – with the stalwarts from the summer’s World Cup campaign sprightly around the latest bright young things. Lingard’s sumptuous, curled shot had punctured USA within minutes of Jordan Pickford denying Christian Pulisic at the visitors’ best opportunity. That chance had been sprung from Lewis Dunk’s pang of nerves on debut though, in truth, there was little trepidation to this display until concentration wavered for periods in the second half. The memory instead will be simply of enthusiasm, even delight.Ben Chilwell was rampant down the left, often combining slickly with Sancho or Alli. Harry Winks was busy and effective on his first home cap. Callum Wilson, on loan at non-league Tamworth six years ago, might have scored early on only to swipe rather tentatively at Lingard’s centre, and was convinced he had won a penalty from Guzan’s challenge moments later, ensuring his left leg made contact with the on-rushing goalkeeper, only for the Spanish official to wave away the appeals. Bournemouth’s first England starter would not be denied his own reward, and forced a volley through Guzan from Fabian Delph’s near-post cross for his final contribution of the night. His display deserved that much.A third debutant, Alex McCarthy, watched Bobby Wood plant a header over the bar. The Southampton goalkeeper’s parents had not witnessed his first cap as they were apparently still flying back from a trekking holiday in Peru. They missed an occasion Rooney will remember from the pre-match guard of honour, through which he strode with his youngest son, Cass, in his arms, to the reception on the final whistle. He ended up delivering a tearful speech in the dressing room. By the time he sits down back in the States to watch Sunday’s crunch tie, he will be a supporter watching a vibrant, young England team make waves without him.League A, Group 1: Germany v NetherlandsB1: Czech Republic v SlovakiaB4: Denmark v Republic of IrelandC3: Cyprus v Norway, Bulgaria v SloveniaD1: Georgia v Kazakhstan (5pm), Andorra v Latvia (5pm)D4: FYR Macedonia v Gibraltar, Liechtenstein v Armenia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b5ec957e60dcb85c82d3ba13cc31220c2f18b5/0_284_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08b69c2422b9a6d5e2bb21a095a3b718","title":"republic of ireland northern ireland international friendly match report","story":"This friendly meeting, laced as it was with all kinds of potential drama, of the two Irish sides was a matter of expediency in the international calendar.A dull scoreless encounter ultimately drew a sense of fateful disappointment for the Republic of Ireland and their manager Martin O’Neill in particular, where Northern Ireland – the country he used to captain with much distinction – should have won.Regular chicanery over player eligibility and assertions of the Republic “poaching” Northern-born players an apparent frostiness between managers Martin and Michael O’Neill over the issue the omnipresent, controversial presence of James McClean in a Republic shirt against the nation who he was capped for at under-21 level, were just a clutch of the thorny matters in question. A joint bid to host the European Under-21 championship in 2023 may evolve into some kind of longer-term detente, but until then games such as this have to be, occasionally, negotiated.The Republic wilted in the second half and had goalkeeper Darren Randolph to thank for denying their more purposeful, if profligate, opponents.“It was very disappointing,” admitted the Republic manager. “We didn’t do enough going forward and could have given a couple of goals away. I’m the manager and it’s my responsibility but my overall disappointment is for the supporters who pay money. We should do more going forward.”Unsurprisingly more coverage centred on this Dublin congress than is normal for a makeweight game of this nature. Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis admitted earlier in the week there would be an “edge” to proceedings, not only in respect to natural cross-border rivalry but because both embattled outfits have Nations League games coming up, the Republic travelling to Denmark, while Northern Ireland – who were relegated last night from their group – host Austria on Sunday.As a symbol of progress – particularly in a week dominated by memories of the 25th anniversary of the Republic’s fraught night in Belfast to qualify for the USA World Cup – there were sightings of those much mocked half-and-half team scarves outside the stadium, although it’s fair to assume the uptake from the 2,200 visiting fans would have been slender.Both O’Neills lament the lack of game-changing quality in their respective squads, and the programme cover, a poignant etching of Johnny Giles and George Best together, only served as a reminder of a devilish, richer past.Conversely, these days Northern Ireland were relying on Liam Boyce of Burton Albion up front, while the Republic looked to Preston’s Callum Robinson, both essentially greenhorns.Still, a crowd of 31,241 which included some free tickets issued by the FAI, was notable enough. However the ferocious jeering of God Save the Queen by the Republic’s fans illustrated an unsavoury and unwanted undercurrent to this fixture remains.“People come to football to boo. I don’t agree with that kind of thing but it’s not something I can dwell on as I am concentrating on the football,” said Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill.“I think we should have won the game and we were in control mainly. It was a similar pattern to our Nations League games where we dominate possession but don’t take chances.“In terms of Sunday we’ll see and we have a bunch of lads desperate to play. I’ll probably make a few changes.”McClean, meanwhile, was both lauded and lacerated from both quarters respectively, putting paid to hopes that cooler, objective mindsets over the controversial winger might prevail. The Stoke player enjoyed a rousing tribute from the Republic supporters upon his second half substitution, an exercise somewhat at odds with a frantic, unproductive showing.Glenn Whelan won his 85th and final cap for the Republic, but of course those veteran legs of hoarding possession eventually reach tipping point. The Aston Villa man was substituted as early as the 35th minute and subsequently afforded one of the evening’s deservedly warmer receptions.Northern Ireland carved out the better of the overall openings, with both Gavin Whyte and Stuart Dallas going close while Shane Duffy should have done better with a close range header at the other end. But the affair simply lacked distinct quality peppered with minor scrapping and hashed opportunities, epitomised by Boyce’s lack of clinical conviction on occasion. But Northern Ireland’s energy was certainly more noteworthy.The Dublin night ended laboriously and mutely compared to the earlier rancour. There was precious little to be uplifted about. That in itself should particularly concern Martin O’Neill, who is quickly running out of ideas and who had to endure boos from a section of the crowd, bookending the dullest of climaxes.Republic of Ireland Randolph Lenihan• (Christie 84), Duffy, Egan, Coleman, Hendrick, Whelan (Hourihane• 36), Brady, McClean (Stevens 66), O’Dowda (Curtis h-t), Robinson (Maguire 66 Hogan 80)League A, Group 1: Germany v NetherlandsB1: Czech Republic v SlovakiaB4: Denmark v Republic of IrelandC3: Cyprus v Norway, Bulgaria v SloveniaD1: Georgia v Kazakhstan (5pm), Andorra v Latvia (5pm)D4: FYR Macedonia v Gibraltar, Liechtenstein v Armenia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21599ee9d5450c7238119b59e0f25b47d3f4a7d4/451_460_2937_1763/master/2937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9823574f5e61639ae0ae2f49cb646ab","title":"slavisa jokanovic fulham manager time","story":"The fact we had entered November and not seen a single manager sacked in the Premier League made for a refreshing change. All too often, dismissals are made in a panic and without the long-term good of the club in question taken into proper consideration. This season it appeared a sense of calm and rational thinking had taken over. All managers seem to have been given time.That was until Wednesday, however, when Fulham sacked Slavisa Jokanovic and immediately announced Claudio Ranieri as his successor. Unfortunately, normal service has been resumed.Don’t get me wrong, it is great to see Ranieri back in the Premier League. He comes across as a very good man and, of course, is the one who led Leicester to one of the greatest sporting achievements of all time. I was as shocked as anyone by Leicester’s decision to sack him less than a year after they had stunned all and won the Premier League.But it is unfortunate that Ranieri’s return is a direct consequence of Jokanovic losing his job because I feel the Serb deserved more time to turn around Fulham’s fortunes. Too often, the very manager who brought success to a club is the one who makes way at the first difficult bump in the road, challenges that should be expected in the Premier League. Jokanovic brought Fulham up – he should have been backed rather than sacked.My brother, Sone, spent one season playing under Jokanovic at Fulham and describes him as being a calm presence in the dressing room and someone who is able to command the respect of all players. Looking in from the outside, it is clear that Jokanovic is a man with a strong belief in an attractive, possession-based playing style as well as in giving young players a chance. Just look at how well Ryan Sessegnon has developed under his charge.Jokanovic should have been given until at least Christmas to try and prove he could establish Fulham in the Premier League. Arguably, though, he made that almost impossible after openly criticising his players before the game against Liverpool at the weekend, accusing them of not showing enough effort and application. It is never a good idea for a manager to criticise his players in public as it creates a lack of trust between both parties. Those conversations should always be done privately. It can also be argued that by sacking Jokanovic, Fulham’s owner, Shahid Khan, is displaying ambition – clearly he is not happy with the team sitting at the bottom of the table after 12 games and, having invested more than £100m in players over the summer, he wants to see them much higher, much sooner. That is his prerogative and suggests he has big plans for the club, in the immediate and long term.What is for sure is that Fulham were leaking far too many goals under Jokanovic and so Ranieri’s first task will be to make them more organised. Fortunately for them, he has a record of doing just that. He is an inherently defensive-minded coach, seen best in his success with Leicester, when the title was won by being solid at the back and ruthless on the counterattack.It is important for any team that is promoted to be strong at the back. They cannot go toe-to-toe with many of the sides they will come up against and so have to be able to defend first and foremost. Burnley are a good example of a team that have managed to do that successfully over a number of seasons, establishing them in the Premier League. Fulham could do worse than follow their example, although it would be a shame if under Ranieri they completely abandoned the attacking style that made them one of the best teams to watch in the Championship. I, for one, was consistently excited by the prospect of watching Fulham play, at Craven Cottage or elsewhere, last season.What is for sure is that they have plenty of time to escape relegation. It is early days in the season and there is very little separating Fulham from the sides immediately above them. Indeed, they are only four points behind Newcastle in 14th.That closeness has formed part of a discussion in recent weeks regarding the lack of competitiveness in the Premier League. For sure there is a stark gap between the clubs at the top and those at the bottom, but for me this is because Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea are so good, rather than Fulham, Huddersfield and Cardiff being particularly bad.It has always been difficult for the have-nots to beat the haves and that is even more the case now because the standard has been raised. If anything, we should count ourselves lucky that we are able to watch exceptional sides led by exceptional managers perform week in, week out in the Premier League. Personally, that is what I want to see – high-level football, and if that means some sides struggling to accumulate points, so be it.Finally, I was on Sky Sports News this week speaking about life in Turin. I really enjoyed doing the feature and hope that people who watched it back home got an insight into a footballers’ life in Italy, in particular my fellow professionals. I said in a previous column that I would love to see more British players open their mind to the possibility of playing abroad, and seeing how well it’s going for me will hopefully persuade some to do just that.

The former captain’s final cameo amounted to 32 minutes, a period illuminated by one sharp shift on to his left foot to whip away a shot that was claimed, one wonderful lofted pass for Ruben Loftus-Cheek to gather, and a shot in injury time which nearly, so nearly, squirmed beneath Brad Guzan and in. His script did not quite extend to a 54th international goal.Rooney-watch continues. “Call me old-fashioned, but hasn’t Rooney shown, in his bit-part, that he is perfectly able to contribute better than most English players at this level, and that he could and would have been an able and positive addition to the England squad at the recent World Cup?” asks Gary Harley. “It says far more for Rooney than it does for England, that he looked at home, calm, confident and expectant to score for England tonight. He deserved his appearance and showed a few of the others up by being there.” Rooney fared well, to be fair, even if it was a little painstaking by the end, like the dad at his kid’s training desperately trying to leather one into the net before things all turn a bit sour. Still, it was a hearty final England appearance for Rooney, with the forward visibly emotional at full-time.Wayne Rooney talks, and speaks very well too. “It went as I imagined it, really,” he says. “It’s been great the last few days, see how they’re working and improving. I would like to thank Gareth and the FA for giving me this opportunity, and the players. I think it’s great the FA are celebrating players who have left a mark on international football in England. I think it’s the right thing to do and I’m sure it will happen again. I thought the lads played brilliant, it was a great game but unfortunately I couldn’t get the goal. I felt when I came on, that I fitted in well with the team. But I’ve had my time, it was two years since I last played. I’m proud, to be the record goalscorer, I can sit back now and watch them.” Of what Brad Guzan, who ultimately prevented him from a 54th England goal, said to him at the final whistle, Rooney adds: “I scored past him a few weeks ago in the league, so I don’t think he was in any mood to let one in.” Of the future under Gareth Southgate, he says: “I think it’s in very safe hands, from what I’ve seen this week. It’s a great group of young players who have a really bright future. I’m sure in the next few years they will go close to bringing a trophy back. I’ll be one of the fans supporting them.”Three and easy, but it was all about Wayne Rooney by the end. The 33-year-old made his 120th appearance for his country, but could not add a 54th goal to his tally. Goals by Callum Wilson, Jesse Lingard and Trent Alexander-Arnold give Gareth Southgate’s side victory at Wembley. At the final whistle, Rooney is all smiles, relaxed and embracing team-mates, applauding the fans. 90+3 min: Another half-chance goes begging for Rooney, who punches the floor in frustration.90+1 min: Rooney twists and turns inside the box, but he cannot beat Brad Guzan! As the USA goalkeeper gobbles it up, the home crowd jeer as though he’s the pantomime villain. Rooney smiles. He knows that was the chance. It was hard and low, but it was too close to truly trouble the goalkeeper.90 min: There will be three added minutes. In other words, Wayne Rooney has three minutes. 88 min: Sancho shoots, but it goes out for a throw-in. 87 min: Bobby Wood wastes a big chance for the USA, and Villafana is replaced by Shaq Moore, who will play the final few minutes at left-back.85 min: Rooney plays a lovely ball to the back stick, where Alexander-Arnold has ghosted in, but the 20-year-old cannot create the angle. The defender unselfishly looks to slide in a team-mate, but there’s nobody in the box to convert. 84 min: It’s Pulisic v Alexander-Arnold once more down the flank, but this time the Liverpool full-back nicks the ball away from the American. 83 min: Pulisic races on to a through ball behind the England defence, again finding plenty of space behind Dunk and Alexander-Arnold. But, in the end, his shot from an acute angle is easily gathered by McCarthy. The Dortmund winger has been a real bright spark all evening for the USA, though.80 min: It’s all a bit lukewarm at Wembley. Everyone’s beckoning Rooney on, can he score his 54th goal for his country? Meanwhile, Tin Jedvaj has scored in injury-time in Zagreb. Croatia lead Spain 3-2, and are heading for a Nations League victory on home soil:78 min: Wilson deserved that. He’s been a nuisance all evening, and after latching on to Fabian Delph’s cross. And that’s Wilson’s last act of the evening, with the Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford on for the final 11 minutes or so. As he heads for a seat on the substitutes bench, there are high-fives all round from Harry Kane, Ben Chilwell and co. A deserved debut goal for the Bournemouth striker. He gets across the near post to stab home England’s third of the evening. 75 min: Miazga gets a block in to deny Wilson – who has had a really lively debut. He deserves a goal, in truth. The chance came after a neat ball by Loftus-Cheek out to Alexander-Arnold, who delivered a sweeping ball into the near post. Wilson tried to poke it goalwards, but Matt Miazga stood firm. 74 min: Rooney’s arrival, unfortunately, has sapped the life out of this game. He did just play a sumptuous ball in for Loftus-Cheek, but the Chelsea midfielder was a little selfish with Wilson lurking in bags of space.71 min: Rooney checks inside, works a yard of space on the edge of the box ... but his shot is comfortably gathered by Brad Guzan. For a moment, almost every person inside Wembley could be heard begging for the same outcome. It was not to be, not yet anyway. 69 min: A ‘fan’ runs on to the pitch and confronts Rooney. It’s all good-natured, but the interloper is soon chased down by a hi-vis steward. And that stoppage means it’s a good time for changes. Loftus-Cheek replaces Winks. 68 min: Ruben Loftus-Cheek is limbering up on the touchline. The game itself has become a little pedestrian, as you might have expected, and feared.66 min: Wood heads over from inside the six-yard box! England go asleep at the corner, with Pulisic allowed to collect the short corner and loft a ball into the box. Wood rises highest but nods over. That triple substitution – and the Rooney factor – has undoubtedly wavered England’s focus a little.63 min: Rooney attempts to slide in Wilson, in behind the USA defence, but Brooks does well to snuff it out. Then Rooney plays a give-and-go with Alexander-Arnold but he cannot quite latch on to the pass. He’s finding his feet, blowing away the cobwebs etc.61 min: Pulisic does superbly, to keep the ball in on the byline before winning an unlikely USA corner. Alexander-Arnold was just waiting for the ball to roll out of play for a goal-kick that never came, and Pulisic seized the initiative. For a player of just 20 years of age, the Dortmund forward has really drove his team on here. The set-play comes to nothing, other than allowing McCarthy a chance to showcase his handling ability, collecting from the corner.60 min: Rooney, wearing the No 10, is playing just behind Callum Wilson in this system. Meanwhile, USA make a change with Green replaced by Tyler Adams.59 min: A clever ball by Brooks drops kindly for Wood, but the USA forward cannot get any real conviction behind the shot. McCarthy clears.57 min: Wayne Rooney is on for his 120th cap! “Rooney! Rooney! Rooney!” It’s not exactly bring-the-house-down noise, but it’s a healthy reception for the former England captain. Dier and Henderson are also on, not that anybody came to Wembley to see those two. Lingard, Chilwell and Alli are off.56 min: The corner is too deep for Dunk, and those England changes are imminent. Wayne Rooney is among the trio about to enter at Wembley.55 min: Callum Wilson does really well again, smartly holding up Alexander-Arnold’s ball before winning another England corner.54 min: Winks spreads the ball wide to an overlapping Chilwell, who cuts it back for Lingard – but his first-time effort is blocked by the buttocks of a USA defender. Meanwhile, Eric Dier and Jordan Henderson are warming up for the hosts. The crowd, of course, begin to chant Wayne Rooney’s name.50 min: “I cannot escape and I cannot forget, Southgate you’re the one, you still turn me on, football’s coming home again!” One, two, three, four! ... it’s all good fun inside a sparse Wembley this evening. We’re fast approaching Rooney-time.49 min: Sancho makes a marauding run into the box but the USA captain does well to stand firm and fend off the Dortmund forward. The visitors then look to build, but Wood cannot get his shot away on the edge of the box. The USA do seem to come alive up front, but are a little lapse at the back. The same can be said for England at times, though perhaps that’s a hint of complacency.48 min: The ball runs all the way through to Jesse Lingard, at the back post, from Alexander-Arnold’s long diagonal from the right. It’s a good ball, but should have been routine for USA to deal with. Instead, Guzan is not sure whether to come or go and Lingard senses the uncertainty, in the end dangling a leg at it as Callum Wilson fails to connect. Another half-chance for the hosts.47 min: Pulisic does really well, striding down the left, going on a mazy run beyond a hapless Winks and Lingard. He drives forward but eventually comes unstuck, just as he enters the final third. Pulisic then has another go, but Delph blocks his effort and with there’s a big thud to boot. Solid stuff. 46 min: USA get the second-half party started. And Alex McCarthy, the Southampton goalkeeper, has indeed replaced Jordan Pickford. Ah, Spain pull level in Croatia. Back under way at Wembley shortly:Croatia have gone one-nil up in Zagreb. Andrej Kramaric has opened the scoring against Spain in the Nations League:Half-time changes: Alex McCarthy, the Southampton goalkeeper, is expected to come on at half-time in place of Jordan Pickford. That was always the plan, not because of an injury to the Everton stopper. It remains to be seen whether the England manager opts to mix it up elsewhere at the interval.So, how soon will Rooney-watch commence? Speaking pre-match, Gareth Southgate intimated we will see England’s all-time record goalscorer around the hour mark. “We will look to give him 25-30 minutes,” Southgate said. “We’ve a few changes we want to make in the second half of the game, a few players who need minutes before Sunday. There’s a few objectives from the game.” Get the lowdown on events elsewhere:A foul by Harry Winks on Timothy Weah is the last slice of action, with goals by Jesse Lingard and Trent Alexander-Arnold the difference at the interval. The hosts have been far superior in all departments, as you’d expect.44 min: This first half is very much fizzling out.43 min: Dave Sarachan‎, the interim USA coach, is stroking his chin in the technical area. He will be happy with glimpses of what he has seen, you’d imagine. But at the back they look so very leaky.40 min: A little lull as we approach half-time, so time for an email. “I’m somewhat surprised that the 10th minute came and went without the sight of an England substitution to bring on their honorary number 10,” says Peter Oh. So far, this has felt all very testimonial-ly, very exhibition match.38 min: Just as the USA are enjoying arguably their best spell of possession, Lingard presses John Brooks into making an error. He wellies the ball straight out of play and England break. It’s a cute ball into Callum Wilson by Chilwell, and the striker does really weel. He spins of Matt Miazga, takes a superb first touch to buy himself a yard of space before unleashing an effort at goal. It’s easy in the end for Guzan but that was a neat move and a decent effort.36 min: And now Julian Green tests Jordan Pickford! It’s straightforward in the end, but England have been a little sloppy in moments defensively. It was a meaty challenge by Trapp on Fabian Delph to win the ball before Green took aim.35 min: Wilson is adjudged to have fouled John Brooks, the giant USA defender. The Bournemouth striker gives him a whack with his left arm as he looks to win the header and USA earn a little respite. The visitors will pump it forward.34 min: USA, defensively, have been all a bit bees round the honeypot. Going forward, they’ve looked lively. Christian Pulisic had that great chance before Lingard’s opener, after England made a mess of fending off an attack through the very spine of the defence. Meanwhile, Alex McCarthy is warming up, apparently getting ready to come on at half-time in place of Pickford.32 min: Ben Chilwell has been brilliant – again in an England shirt. The Leicester defender has been involved in just about everything. He’s just kickstarted another smart move, skating down the left before bundling into his marker. The USA earn a free-kick. But, England are cruising already really.30 min: England have been free-flowing in attack, but USA have looked very frail, to the point where Gareth Southgate’s side look like scoring with every half-chance. Or maybe that is a marker of this England side’s performance.The Liverpool full-back powers home, after more dodgy defending by the visitors. The ball breaks kindly after USA make a mess of clearing their lines and Trent Alexander-Arnold – first-time – smacks the ball low into the corner beyond Guzan. It was more good work by Jadon Sancho in the buildup.Alli slides the ball across to Jesse Lingard, who wraps his right foot around the ball and bends it beyond Brad Guzan from outside the box. A lovely finish. Seconds after a crucial stop by Jordan Pickford, England lead. The USA look dangerous going forward but worryingly suspect at the back.23 min: Pickford makes a big save as England go to sleep at the back! Pulisic ends up chasing his own pass, after Dunk and Keane get sucked in to the ball. England don’t win it in the challenge and Pulisic gallops through the heart of defence to latch on to the ball. He bears down on Pickford, but shoots straight at the Everton goalkeeper’s torso. England survive. That could have been costly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

Her withdrawal meant May was made party leader without having been elected by members.As the most senior figure from the Vote Leave campaign still inside May’s deeply-ided cabinet, Gove’s backing is regarded as pivotal to her efforts to keep her Brexit deal alive.But the environment secretary is said to be urging the prime minister to shift her stance, and allow negotiators to go back to Brussels in a last-ditch bid to secure a deal that could be backed by parliament.Gove’s close ally, Conservative backbencher Nick Boles, has called for the UK to try to secure a close, Norway-style relationship in the short term – and then negotiate a free trade deal.Former Gove adviser Henry Newman claimed on Thursday that Raab had been frozen out of the Brexit process in recent weeks, with drafting changes sprung on him at the last minute.Gove was reported to have spoken up in support of May’s deal at Wednesday’s gruelling cabinet meeting, where most pro-Brexit ministers express scepticism.One senior Brexiter said it was highly unlikely May would accede to Gove’s demands, because she is now so closely associated with the Brexit deal.The wrangle comes as Downing Street reels from a blizzard of resignations – including that of Raab – after Wednesday’s five hour-long cabinet meeting, at which she initially appeared to have secured her ministers’ backing.Esther McVey resigned as work and pensions secretary on Thursday morning, as May prepared for a a three-hour marathon session in the House of Commons taking questions from MPs, many of them hostile interventions from her own side.A growing number of backbench Conservative MPs, including the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, are demanding a vote of no confidence in the prime minister’s leadership.One cabinet source said: “We think she can survive two resignations. But if it gets to three she’s in trouble.”Gove stood as Conservative leader after the referendum campaign in 2016, knocking his rival Boris Johnson out of the race, but losing out to Theresa May, who profited from the unseemly squabbling of her rivals.Even if May is not challenged for the leadership in the coming days, it looks increasingly likely that she will fail to get her deal through parliament when she presents it to MPs, expected to be in early December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e0a35dd6fadc8bf88e983f7f2d8b42f5485609/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2111db3a3849632d7d2cd7c93d4f870f","title":"may has no credibility left readers on the brexit deal","story":"Readers are discussing cabinet resignations and the prime minister’s statement in the CommonsMay, along with her plan, is dead in the water. The proposed agreement (should we now call it the “Draft Disagreement”?) seems unlikely to get through parliament and she now has no credibility left. Brexit, always an impossible fantasy, is unravelling. Surely this whole charade needs to be given a quiet burial and Article 50 rescinded so that we can move on to rebuilding our links with the EU as a fully-engaged member? CaroleB999It is becoming increasingly obvious that the whole decision should be passed back to the electorate. The argument from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg etc that “democracy has spoken” does not hold true. In June 2016 the people of this country were asked to sign a blank cheque after a campaign of lies and myths, “easy trade deals, 350 million for the NHS”. It has been proven over the past two wasted years Brexit is creating a crisis not seen since Suez and the second world war. Brexiteers are running scared of another vote, many young adults now have the vote, it is their future that is being played with. I should add I am 68 years old and a staunch remainer: the EU is not perfect but the alternative is much, much worse. kimorrisYou know what’s tragically hilarious about all of this? One of the reasons people want to leave the EU is because they believe the UK can negotiate stronger trade deals with the wider world than the EU can manage. How’s that looking, Leavers? We couldn’t even negotiate the orce settlement like professionals. Keith TaylorNo Deal looking very likely now. Bad times ahead, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable in society. The rich among us will feed like vultures on the financial chaos that ensues. Every food, health and welfare standard will get binned to obtain bad trade deals. The NHS will be sold piecemeal to American companies in order to facilitate trade deal too. It’s going to be a mess that’ll take us 20 years to recover from – if we ever do. NTDRaab, like Davis and Johnson before him, is running off the stage so he doesn’t have to confront the consequences of his outrageous lies. Easiest deal in history? We hold all the cards? This was supposed to be a glorious national liberation. Instead, we’re being humiliated and reduced. Or is that still ‘Project Fear’? UltralightbeamThis is the inevitable consequence of having a rational person as PM. She knew from the start that the Brexiter’s unicorns could not be delivered without trashing the economy. In retrospect it would have been better to have had Andrea Leadsom as PM and a cabinet full of true believers. Then they would not be able to hide behind May and pretend that they could have done a better job. I think a general election is on its way. SowesterHard to know what Corbyn is pitching. Is he suggesting we should go into a general election, where Labour will sweep to power on the promise of more extensions and transitions while Corbyn has his own pop at unpicking freedom of movement from the “four freedoms”, like a sword from a stone, so that the “six tests” are met? KlaatuI have now found a paragraph about Northern Irish citizenship. They are being allowed to have EU privileges we are not? That must be wrong. Nothing about the rest of us having our EU citizenship arbitrarily confiscated against our will. I am writing to our MP about that. Some time ago I wrote to Verhofstadt and he was sympathetic, saying he hoped to table a motion for us Europhiles to keep some form of EU citizenship but I have heard no more. The whole Brexit thing is gross insult to remain supporters (over half the electorate now it seems) and surely of questionable legality, or if not, most certainly morally unacceptable. weightheevidenceTwo years ago Britain walked out on a long marriage to the EU. The EU just didn’t understand Britain. Free at last, Britain would hook up with younger fitter models around the world. Yesterday Britain got shown into the new bedsit. On the bed was a box with lawyer’s bills, a maintenance agreement and an unfavourable custody arrangement. sanjeevaGo back and think again seems like the only rational idea at this point. What do the British people want? To jump right out, to maintain connection, or stay in? If the combined numbers of jump and connect are more than remain, let this miserable process continue. If Remain outnumbers both of those, we can draw a line under the past two years and everyone can get on with their lives. We’re all far more aware of how connected to Europe we are on security, science, manufacturing, the NHS, food production etc etc etc. Now is the time for the check and balance of a People’s Vote. tickyt"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2a911bff70f5927071218c1c82b3260c6afff5/0_37_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bfd3f5a61e4e4820a55c62859e57d09","title":"peers block lord lesters suspension over harassment claims","story":"Vote stops action against peer accused of pressuring woman to have sex with him A women’s rights campaigner has said she feels “victimised all over again” after the House of Lords voted to block the suspension of a Liberal Democrat peer who was found to have promised to make her a baroness if she agreed to sleep with him.Jasvinder Sanghera, a long-time campaigner against forced marriage, told the  she had no faith in anti-harassment efforts in the Lords after peers voted down the punishment imposed on Anthony Lester.The privileges and conduct committee announced on Monday that Lord Lester would be suspended until June 2022 for sexual harassment and “corrupt inducements”, after three separate inquiries over a year.The committee’s report said Lester told Sanghera: “If you sleep with me, I will make you a baroness within a year.”The suspension, the longest for a peer or an MP since the second world war, required endorsement by the full Lords chamber. However, after a debate lasting two and a half hours, another peer and supporter of Lester, David Pannick, forced a vote.He tabled an amendment to the report saying it should be sent back to the committee because it had not acted “in accordance with the principles of natural justice and fairness”. The vote was won by 101 to 78, stopping the suspension.Sanghera, 53, said she felt the punishment had been blocked by “what I can only describe as the old boy network”.She said: “I feel as if I’ve been victimised all over again, bullied and traduced. What I witnessed there today were many of Lord Lester’s friends, who declared that they were his friends, making representations on behalf of him. And I don’t think that was fair.“This process has gone through three levels, all legal appeals were rejected, and today they’ve undermined the whole process and undermined the commissioner and me.Lester, 82, who has denied the claims, objected to the process, saying it was wrong that he had been unable to cross-examine Sanghera’s evidence, whether directly or via a representative.Lord Pannick, also a leading QC, made the argument in the debate that “you are entitled to cross-examine or have cross-examination conducted, of the person who accuses you”.But Sanghera’s lawyers say they were surprised that Lester complained about the way the inquiry was handled only after it was over.The alleged harassment is said to have taken place around 11 years ago, and Sanghera first reported it to parliamentary authorities in November 2017.After an investigation by the Lords commissioner for standards, the subcommittee on Lords conduct recommended Lester be expelled – the first time such action would have been taken.However, Lester appealed, and, while the privileges and conduct committee upheld the conclusion, it opted for suspension, as the rule allowing expulsion was only introduced in 2015.Sanghera told the inquiry that the harassment began after she attended a meeting at the Lords and missed her evening train. Lester suggested she stay at his London home.He groped her thigh while driving her to the house and made suggestive remarks, she said. The next morning, when his wife had left, Lester chased Sanghera around the kitchen, she said.It was at a later meeting at the Lords, she said, that Lester made the offer. She told the inquiry: “He even spelled it out, putting my surname in, and asked me how that sounded.”The report said Sanghera, who was not named in the investigation but came forward afterwards, provided six witnesses, among them a judge, who were able to say she had described the events immediately after she said they had taken place.John McFall, the senior deputy speaker in the Lords, said he was “deeply disappointed” in the vote, and the privileges and conduct committee would meet next week to decide the next step.“I fully support the commissioner for standards and the work she has undertaken for many months. Every step of the way she followed the processes as agreed by the house and that have not been questioned before today. I would also like to express my sympathy to the complainant at what must be a very difficult time for her,” Lord McFall said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b12c90ea2253edf8aa040b5ec2dbebacbca71c/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37516ce7f52cf7badaba5d2fea7fa4da","title":"theresa may vows to see brexit plan through on day of turmoil","story":"PM says UK faces ‘path of deep and grave uncertainty’ if her efforts are derailedTheresa May pleaded with her party not to plunge Britain into “deep and grave uncertainty” by rejecting her Brexit deal, as she fought to shore up her authority after a bruising day of resignations and backbench mutiny.At a sombre press conference following a dramatic day of turmoil, the prime minister said she believed “with every fibre of my being” that the 585-page agreement unveiled on Wednesday night was “the right one for our country and all our people”.“If we do not move forward with that agreement, nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow. It would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it,” she said.Her defiant Downing Street statement came after an extraordinary 24 hours in Westminster, which included the resignations of two Brexit-leaning cabinet ministers – Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary – and a string of other junior appointees.The future of several other cabinet ministers remains in doubt. Environment secretary Michael Gove was offered but turned down the role of Brexit secretary vacated by Raab. It is understood Gove sought to insist on a change of Brexit strategy, which May’s robust statement gave little indication she could accept.It was unclear on Thursday night whether he could remain in his post having apparently questioned such a central plank of the prime minister’s policy. Friends said he was considering his position.As the most senior figure from the Vote Leave campaign still inside May’s cabinet, his departure could pose a significant threat to her grip on Downing Street.Gove’s fellow Brexiters Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, and Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary who was thought to have been trying to persuade May to give MPs a free vote on the deal, were also believed to be considering their positions.The threat of a challenge to the prime minister’s leadership also appears increasingly serious, after the influential backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg publicly withdrew his support.Pressed about whether she believed her authority had been dented by the string of resignations and the hostile reaction to the deal from many in her own party, May insisted “leadership is about taking the right decisions not the easy ones”.“As prime minister, my job is to bring back a deal that delivers on the vote of the British people … Am I going to see this through? Yes.”Raab had told chief whip Julian Smith of his decision to quit on Wednesday night after the fraught five-hour cabinet meeting that saw ministers grudgingly accept May’s deal. He held his post for just four months, after the resignation of David Davis.Speaking on Thursday, he said he believed it was a “terrible deal” and urged May to change course.“I felt the proposed deal with the EU suffered two fatal flaws,” he told Sky News. “The first one is the rather predatory terms being proposed by the EU, which I feel would threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom.“Secondly, in relation to the so-called backstop, basically what that would do is indefinitely if not permanently lock us in to a regime which I believe would be damaging to the economy but devastating to public trust in our democracy.”Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, submitted his letter to the chair of the powerful 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, expressing no confidence in the prime minister’s leadership.Forty-eight Conservative MPs would need to back a no-confidence vote in\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspto trigger a leadership contest, according to party rules.The ballot is based on “one member, one vote”, but in 2016 one of the final two candidates, Andrea Leadsom,\u0026nbspwithdrew from the race\u0026nbspafter a\u0026nbspdamaging interview with the Times about the fact that May did not have children. Her withdrawal meant May was made party leader without having been elected by members.If Brady receives 48 such letters, he must announce a vote of no confidence, which could be held within days. More than a dozen others said they had submitted letters by the end of Thursday – though there was no indication the target of 48 had been reached.At a hastily-convened press conference, Rees-Mogg predicted that a leadership contest could take place within weeks, and named a series of possible successors to May including Boris Johnson, Raab and McVey.He was speaking outside parliament just as May finished a three-hour grilling inside on her Brexit deal, which saw a string of hostile interventions from Tory MPs.During testy exchanges, May insisted she had clinched the best Brexit deal possible, but conceded that “difficult choices” had been made and that she “shared concerns” that the UK could be locked into the backstop arrangement aimed at avoiding a hard border in Ireland.One backbencher, Mark Francois, told her the deal was, “dead on arrival”.Jeremy Corbyn ridiculed her insistence that she would press ahead with the negotiations: “When even the last Brexit secretary, who, theoretically at least, negotiated the deal, says that ‘I cannot support the proposed deal’, what faith does that give anyone else in this place or in this country? The government simply cannot put to parliament this half-baked deal that both the Brexit secretary and his predecessor have rejected.”As well as Raab and McVey’s departures, two more junior ministers – Suella Braverman and Shailesh Vara – also quit, along with two parliamentary aides.Some senior Tories were infuriated at the wrecking tactics of Rees-Mogg and his colleagues, and May received staunch support from Nicky Morgan – whom May sacked as education secretary when she arrived in Downing Street – and Amber Rudd.Alistair Burt, the Middle East minister, said: “I think we’re all a bit tired of this. Out there are real jobs, real lives and real people who would be sabotaged by a no deal favoured by Jacob. Enough.”In her press conference, May made clear she remains determined to bring her deal to parliament, once the final details are hammered out with the EU27, and give MPs the chance to vote on it.“Their job will be to look at that deal and consider the interests of constituents … MPs from across my party will look at that deal and recognise the importance of delivering on the vote of British people,” she said.However, with Labour and the DUP pledged to vote against the deal, and a series of Tory rebels insisting they cannot back it, winning the “meaningful vote”, which is expected to take place in early December, looks like a daunting task.The DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said he could take May through a list of promises she made about the future of Northern Ireland but that would be a “waste of time because she clearly doesn’t listen”.He told MPs: “The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state with the breakup of the UK.”May began her press conference by saying that serving as prime minister was an honour and a privilege but “also a heavy responsibility”, adding: “That is true at any time but especially when the stakes are so high.”She insisted that she was working in the national interest and not the Tory party’s or her own, but said that she did not “judge harshly” those ministers who had left government.May is under pressure to appoint a new Brexit secretary, with final negotiations on the political declaration on Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU due to take place in the coming days.Earlier in the day, Donald Tusk, the European council president, had said he would call a 25 November Brexit summit to allow leaders to sign off on the deal, unless “something extraordinary happens”.When, later in the day, Tusk was asked about the resignations in London, he told reporters: “It is not for me to comment on the latest developments in London... the EU is prepared for a final deal with the United Kingdom. We are also prepared for a no deal scenario – but of course we are best prepared for a no Brexit scenario.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f2bfd59c548e24b0ddbf99d7358bb06bc1eb08/0_7_4297_2578/master/4297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9db8bd2f374eea5490ec891ee80a8fc","title":"brexit deal theresa may takes agreement to parliament politics live","story":"Prime minister holds press conference after resignations and tough questions from MPs in the CommonsThe former government minister, James Duddridge, suggests the number of letters required to trigger a vote may already have been reached as the Tory MP, Adam Holloway, becomes the latest to submit one.Duddridge, who sent in his own call to the 1922 Committee chairman, Graham Brady, during the Tory conference in October, said:I think I recall Brady said he will give the PM 48 hours notice before going public. We may have hit the 48 letters but no announcement.Here’s a look at some of tomorrow’s front pages – most of which, as one might imagine, lead on the Brexit story. is among those to note that, despite the forces of all political colours now arrayed against her, May fights on:It is perhaps revelatory that papers that usually have opposing viewpoints, particularly on Brexit, follow a similar line. They include the Times and the Financial Times, as well as the Daily  and the :Perhaps most notable is that the Daily Mail, under new management of course, which goes yet further. It attacks the hard Brexiters to whom it used to hand so much positive coverage, who it now accuses of denouncing May’s deal without offering a viable alternative.Moreover, it says that – beyond a hard Brexit and no Brexit at all – there is no viable alternative:In a not-dissimilar vein, the I paper and  focus on the fire May is come under from her own side:While the Daily Mirror and City AM both lead on the prime minister’s cricketing sign-off at this afternoon’s press conference:And finally, some might suggest the only paper to get it right is the Daily Star, which leads on a story about Holly Willoughby – giving the day’s Brexit news no more than a bottom corner slot:Theresa May has met Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, at Downing Street to discuss the Brexit plan this evening. A Downing Street spokesman has said:They commended the hard work of negotiating teams and the constructive discussions that have taken place with Spain and the European Union to ensure that important mutual interests are protected, and new opportunities are enabled for all.In particular, the prime minister and chief minister welcomed the conclusion of a protocol on Gibraltar that forms an integral part of the draft withdrawal agreement and will provide certainty to citizens and businesses in Gibraltar and the surrounding area.The leaders agreed that these arrangements reflected the determination of all parties to move forward in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation.Two leading Brexiter MPs, David Davis and Owen Paterson, have attacked Theresa May’s proposed EU withdrawal agreement at an event in Washington DC.Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said the withdrawal agreement proposed by the prime minister was “a very poor deal”, while Paterson said it was “so bad it cannot be allowed to proceed.”Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a neoconservative thinktank, the men – who were joined by Shanker Singham of the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank – complained that the deal effectively prevented the UK from having an independent trade policy and striking trade deals with other countries.“This is the greatest tragedy of this deal: it takes a country that could have been a major player in solving global problems, and it makes it completely irrelevant,” said Singham.Davis predicted that May’s deal would be voted down by parliament, and that the UK would then have to return to EU negotiators and request further concessions. Both Davis and Paterson said leaving without any deal would be preferable to parliament agreeing to May’s proposal.Davis conceded that “there may be a hiccup or two in the first year if we have a no deal outcome”, but argued that the EU would rapidly agree a free trade deal with the UK because it would be in both countries’ interests to do so.The former Brexit secretary has previously predicted incorrectly that the UK would rapidly agree a series of free trade deals following Brexit.A report suggests the arch-Brexiter, Michael Gove, has turned down the Brexit secretary job. It had been said his price for taking it would have been renegotiation of the draft agreement.Gove is currently the environment secretary.It appears Penny Mordaunt’s support for a free vote on the Brexit deal is being briefed out in Westminster this evening:The Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, has warned pro-Brexit Conservative backbenchers they run the risk of leaving the UK within the EU if they oppose Theresa May’s plan.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who appeared at an event alongside Cairns this evening, refused to speak to journalists after earlier batting away suggestions he might resign over the draft EU withdrawal agreement.The two ministers hosted a Board of Trade meeting at Swansea University, during which Cairns said the government’s lack of a Commons majority meant any successor to May would find it equally hard to satisfy all parties. He added:Changing the prime minister doesn’t change the arithmetic of parliament. So, therefore, colleagues need to accept the context in which we’re working.I would say to the hardliner Leavers who want to leave without a deal that they run the risk of not having a Brexit.And I would say to the ones who are Remainers who want to ignore the outcome of the referendum that they’re running the risk of leaving without a deal, which is the worst that each side would want.Cairns admitted the draft agreement was a “compromise”, and described the “backstop” plan to prevent a hard border in Ireland as a “negative” aspect.My colleague, David Pegg, is keeping an eye on the Heritage Foundation’s Brexit conference, where two Brexit-supporting former government ministers – David Davis and Owen Paterson – have been among those offering their thoughts:There has been some talk in Westminster about Michael Gove’s whereabouts but my colleague, Heather Stewart, has this:Here’s the full text of Corbyn’s email to Labour members (emphasis his):The government is falling apart before our eyes. Their half-baked deal has unravelled, the prime minister has lost all authority and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her Cabinet - let alone parliament and the people of our country.Our party conference agreed that this deal would be judged against our six tests, and if it failed to meet them we would vote against it.After two years of bungled negotiations, the government has produced a botched deal that breaches the prime minister’s own red lines, does not meet our six tests and will leave the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say.As I said in parliament earlier today, people around the country will be feeling anxious about the industries they work in, the jobs they hold and the stability of this country.We do not accept that the choice is between the government’s deal and ‘no deal’. We will work across parliament to stop a ‘no deal’ outcome. Labour has set out our alternative plan for a sensible Brexit that would work for all of our nations and regions, bring parliament and the country together, support jobs and our economy and guarantee rights, standards and protections.If parliament votes down this shambolic Tory deal – as seems likely – this will represent a loss of confidence in the government. In those circumstances, the best outcome for the country is an immediate general election that can sweep the Tories from power and deliver the Labour government this country desperately needs.If we cannot get a general election, in line with our conference policy, we will support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.We are ready to lead, ready to deliver a sensible deal that works for all our regions and nations and ready to build a Britain that works for the many, not the few.Jeremy CorbynLeader of the Labour PartyThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has written to party members this evening, talking up the possibility of a general election if Theresa May cannot get her deal through parliament – “as seems likely”. And one line stands out in particular:If we cannot get a general election, in line with our conference policy, we will support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.So, Corbyn is being explicit with members: He will back another referendum if he cannot force a general election.Now, that was clearly the case at conference this autumn – as Corbyn rightly points out in his email. But there were some concerns among remain-supporting Labour members about whether or not he really did back that after he told Der Speigel at the weekend that “we can’t stop” Brexit.The rumour mill had suggested Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, was considering resigning. So, her arrival at Number 10 shortly after the prime minister’s press conference caused some eyebrows to be raised in expectation.No need, according to the Daily ’s chief political correspondent, Christopher Hope:The Lib Dems, perhaps unsurprisingly, are giving short shrift to Theresa May’s defence of her Brexit plan this evening. The party’s leader, Vince Cable, says:The prime minister took a long time to say nothing this afternoon. She appears to be in denial.The facts haven’t changed. There is no majority in Parliament for her deal, and she has rightly conceded that ‘No Brexit’ is the real alternative to it. There must now be a people’s vote to break the deadlock and get the country out of this mess.Little known fact about Theresa May she has an exceptionally good memory. She can “read a full statement and repeat it almost verbatim”, Philip Cowley and Dennis Kavanagh write in their definitive account of the 2017 general election. “As one of her team noted: ‘She reads it through once, it’s an almost photographic memory. And I mean word-for-word, not paraphrasing.’”You saw that in action today. There were at least two lines that May used in her answers that sounded pre-scripted, and that she used twice. First, there was: “Am I going to see this through? Yes.” And then there was the spiel how she would be doing her job (negotiating a Brexit deal) and that after that it would be up to MPs to do their job (pass the wretched thing).As news lines, these don’t really take us us very far. The first is little more than a slogan, although at least it quashes, for the moment, any speculation that May is going to stand down. The second sheds a bit more light on the strategy she might use to get her deal through parliament MPs will be told it is their national duty to approve the deal, with the implication that if they vote it down, they will be held responsible for the catastrophe that will follow. What is curious about May, and probably a huge weakness, is her reluctance to take on the arguments of her opponents. She made a modest attempt to explain the need in the Brexit process to accept difficult compromises. But on a day when her Brexiter opponents have been dominating the airwaves, she made no attempt to berate them for the multiple fake promises they made during the EU referendum campaign, despite being given an open invitation to do so. (See 5.35pm.) You can’t win an argument unless you’re willing to tell your opponents they’re wrong. But she won’t. It is as if somehow she has internalised the Brexiter mindset.What rescued the press conference was her Geoffrey Boycott answer to the final question, which she delivered so well that it could have been staged (although I don’t think it was.) (See 5.52pm.) It made for polished TV, and was about as good a clip as May has ever delivered. But it is still just a slogan. To get Brexit through the Commons, she will need a lot more than that.That’s all from me for today.My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over.This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.Q: You are a cricket fan.

The answer to that question might in part be down to your genes, research suggests.Scientists say a genetic predisposition to perceiving the bitterness of particular substances appears to nudge us towards one beverage or the other.Dr Marilyn Cornelis, co-author of the research from Northwestern University in Illinois, said: “The study adds to our understanding of factors determining beverage preferences – taste, in particular – and why, holding all other factors constant, we still see marked between-person differences in beverage preference as well as the amount we consume.” The study, published in the Scientific Reports journal, involved two sets of data. The first was a large twin study which showed that, at least in those of European ancestry, particular genetic variants are linked to the strength of perception of different tastes: one specific variant was associated with slightly higher ratings of bitterness for caffeine, another to greater bitterness for quinine and a third to greater bitterness for a drug known as propylthiouracil, or prop.The team then looked at data from another source: the UK Biobank, a research endeavour that recruited hundreds of thousands of participants aged 37 to 73 between 2006-10 and involved the collection of genetic data as well as health information, including answers to the question of how many cups of different drinks participants consumed each day.Because our genes are fixed at conception, and our genetic variation can be thought of as random, they allow scientists to explore a sort of “natural experiment”, meaning they can look beyond many of the social or environmental factors that can muddy the waters of our hot drink habits.The team found people with a greater genetic predisposition to perceiving the bitterness of caffeine drank a little more coffee, but an increased perception of the bitterness of quinine and prop were linked to a small reduction in coffee drinking.The reverse patterns were seen when the team looked at the genetic variants and how much tea participants drank.The team also found that greater perception of the bitterness of prop was linked to a lower chance of being a heavy drinker of alcohol.While the study has limitations, including that it relied on self-reporting of tea and coffee drinking, the team say it could help shed light on which cuppa we prefer.“Given humans generally avoid bitter tastes, we interpret these findings as possibly a learned behaviour: if we can perceive caffeine well we associate this with the psychostimulant properties of caffeine and so seek more coffee,” said Cornelis.Cornelis said the findings for tea were harder to explain, but might in part be down to heavy coffee drinkers tending to be very light tea drinkers.Ong added the findings for tea might be down to tea containing lower concentrations of bitter substances, meaning it might prove more acceptable than coffee to those with heightened perception of bitterness.“Our taste genes partially play a role in how much coffee, tea or alcohol we drink,” he said. “The preference towards tea can be seen as a consequence of abstaining from coffee, because our genes might have made coffee a little too bitter for our palates to handle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac96cf6238c8e4e6ca7c3de3f755ce283a39b92/56_0_1942_1000/master/1942.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26e1d4df94982410114785756e412d4c 480w","title":"the lazy zombies guide to youth a radio course with the power to change lives","story":"A new course from ŠKODA is giving young adults a chance to explore their creativity, voice their feelings and expand their skillsOnce home to countless giants of broadcasting, Manchester’s Granada Studios is now a training ground for a new generation. Though the telly sets are long gone, it remains the home of Reform Radio, an online station that also acts as an incubator for young people interested in a career on the airwaves.And if getting ahead in creative industries means subverting expectations, it’s clear the latest batch of students are off to a good start. Huddled around mixing desks and microphones, the show they’re workshopping is called The Lazy Zombies’ Guide to Youth – a sardonic riff on the perceived lack of motivation and creative energy often attributed to the digital generation.They arrived on Monday with little to no relevant experience by the end of the week they’ll produce and present the show to a gathered audience of friends and family. A project from ŠKODA in partnership with The Prince’s Trust as part of the former’s Driver’s Seat Initiative – which aims to celebrate independently minded people who want to make a positive difference to the world – it’s open to 16-25-year-olds who are not in education or employment. That’s a fairly broad window of eligibility, so what drives participants to get involved?For Rhys Forteau, 19, it’s about generating a creative spark. “I think that doing something creative helps you understand yourself a bit better – you find new sides to yourself, and that gives you more motivation,” he says. “My mum wanted me to be a care assistant. I did a bit of training and I enjoyed it at first, but it’s not something I could see myself doing in five years’ time. This course has shown me I can make my own opportunities, not just follow in others’ footsteps.”Along with independent thought, another trait in no short supply among the group is tenacity. Jacob Bowen and Sophie Heng-Travis, both 24, have worked in a number of jobs since graduating with qualifications in creative fields, though both feel they have yet to realise their full potential. For them, the course is an opportunity to widen their skillsets and meet similarly ambitious people.“For me it’s about building my toolkit,” says theatre graduate Bowen. “It’s alright doing filler jobs for a while, but I graduated three years ago. It gets a bit tedious.”Writer and poet Heng-Travis agrees, and suggests it’s a lack of persistence that leads to a lot of young people falling short of achieving their dreams. “I think for some people our age, it’s sad that you have to settle and just do something that’s not what you want to do. But you have to make money and be part of the system, which can mean doing something that’s mediocre. That’s what I find frustrating. But you’ve got to be persistent, you’ve got to keep going.”Course tutor Adam Seymour has not only seen the effect the course has had on countless young people – he’s also a living, breathing testament to the power of training to change lives. He took a similar course himself as a student two years ago, at a time when mental health issues had been holding him back. “I didn’t have a lot of confidence in my own abilities,” says Seymour. “I needed a bit of a boost, a safe space, I needed people around me who were in the same boat, because sometimes when you’re suffering with anxiety and depression and other wellbeing issues, it’s hard to reach out to people.”Seymour’s experience suggests it’s not simply inidual qualities, but rather a joint mentality of determination, and a willingness to collaborate, that’s the key to making the most of a course like this. Bowen agrees: “Having a platform where we can use that fire in our belly, from all the things that are going on with today’s youth, is massively, massively important. It’s about getting together with a few different people from different backgrounds, being on a level playing field and having something to say.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe65b87703bc20d82471bd0973fbb747ddce33b/424_137_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a5d6d90abb53b06b0c38d325c1d324","title":"why young creatives are choosing theatre over digital mediums","story":"Theatre may not seem like the natural medium of young people, but a creative course from ŠKODA is finding that plenty of aspiring young people are keen to get a start in the craftGathered in a studio space within Birmingham Repertory Theatre are a group of people who have either discovered an incredible anti-ageing product, or are bucking a serious trend. According to audience-monitoring charity Audience Agency, younger people are in such short supply at the theatre that the typical crowd’s average age is 52 years old. This lot, it seems, are the exceptions.The group are taking a week-long theatre course that’s part of ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative, which works in partnership with the Prince’s Trust, to give people aged 16–25 not in education or employment a leg-up. The initiative includes starter courses in all sorts of digitally-focused creative industries that you might expect the younger generation to opt for instead of fusty old theatre, so what’s the allure of this most analogue of mediums?“It’s an evolving art form, which fascinates me,” says 21-year-old Freddie Apperly. “What’s considered the norm of theatrical practices today, could be old school and prehistoric in 20 years’ time.” Considering the proliferation of immersive theatre, and the cross-pollination of mediums evident in entertainment such as Secret Cinema and escape rooms, it’s hard to disagree with him.For Laurie Weston, 22, a grounding in theatre is the ideal way to pick up transferable skills. “It’s a great way to learn collaboration and teamwork,” he says. “You’ve got actors who bounce off each other, then you’ve also got people who design the set, sound and lighting who all have to work closely together to get the cues right.”To other young people, the very fact that theatre isn’t a primarily digital medium is all part of the appeal. “Curiosity drove me because I just wanted to know how it works,” says 18-year-old Harry Bell, who’s keen to get backstage to find out more about sound and lighting. “I went to see Chicago with school – now, I can’t remember a thing about Chicago, but I just remember thinking: ‘How are they getting those actors’ voices from there to my ears?’ I wanted to know how it worked, the acoustics of the theatre, I wanted to understand that.”As well as a reputation for appealing to older generations, theatre also carries an image of inaccessibility and elitism at a grassroots level. And while today’s would-be thesps are well aware of the barriers to entry, it seems these are not enough to put them off. For 20-year-old Danni Manley, it just means being more selective about the doors you try to shove your foot in. “I went to apply for drama schools, but you have to pay to audition and I couldn’t afford them all, so I only did two out of three,” she says. “It’s quite annoying. It doesn’t put me off, it just makes it harder.”Bell, for one, is taken by a medium that offers an alternative to the polished, nipped and tucked output of most digital media consumed through a screen. “With theatre, you can’t really fix anything in post,” he says. “You have to get it right, there and then. That’s definitely something I want to do, without a doubt in my mind.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36499f0240324c372cebdc13a7012790a4cb25e0/26_0_3601_2161/master/3601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7fdb50509a35e171f1fa24e1201dd02","title":"davis cup atp cup merge tennis","story":"Tennis might be fighting for its soul but Roger Federer remains its beating heart.On a day when it was learned that a merger of the revamped 118-year-old Davis Cup and the new ATP Cup – which will be held within six weeks of each other at the end of next year and the beginning of 2020 – is one solution being considered to break the impasse that has gripped the sport for five years, the Swiss cruised into the semi-finals of the ATP Tour Finals for the 15th time.He needed to win only five games against Kevin Anderson to move within two wins of lifting the trophy for a seventh time but he found another gear to win 6-4, 6-3 in an hour and a quarter. All of the matches in this tournament have been quick, some sadly so. This was a good match, but hardly memorable.Federer might yet have to get past the world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Saturday to reach the final, knowing his old adversary has stopped him here three times in the past, but his game is in sound shape.He makes his mistakes elegantly, moving on from a slightly skewed backhand to a cool, crisp forehand thrash as if swatting flies. And there were enough of those to put away last night to get him over the line.Victory put Federer top of group Guga Kuerten, so the only way he avoids a semi-final against Djokovic is if the Serb loses to Marin Cilic on Friday and John Isner beats Alexander Zverev.“I’m very happy,” he said. When isn’t he? Perhaps when wrestling with self-doubt after struggling with a hand injury that struck at the start of the grasscourt season, but there was no sign of physical inconvenience here.Other statistics will record that he made 14 unforced errors – 10 of them in a slightly nervy second set – but overall the performance had an air of flawlessness about it.Federer broke Anderson to love for 4-3 after 24 minutes and again without conceding a point in the ninth game – yet in between dropped his own serve. He double-faulted in giving up three break points but still held to secure the set. This was carefree, get-out-of-gaol tennis, entertaining and full of rich, expansive strokes. No wonder there were occasional mistakes from both sides of the net.He and Anderson were now in the semi-finals. All that needed to be determined was who would finish top of the group – and then the mathematical fun would start. As so often, it was Federer.The match meandered to an almost mundane conclusion, pleasant and pretty enough but without the requisite tension to command serious attention. Federer squandered two match points before breaking the big serve of the South African for a second time in the set to close it out.Elsewhere, there were waves on Planet Tennis. At an amicable meeting in London on Tuesday night, the Association of Tennis Professionals and the International Tennis Federation came closer than they have ever been to resolving their differences.However, while a merger of their rival Cups would be hugely popular with players torn between loyalty to their national teams and the lure of another cash-rich tournament with ranking points, an insider at the meeting said: “It is a definite possibility down the line but there is a bit of work to do to get there.”The stumbling block is the fact the ITF handed over stewardship of the Davis Cup to the Kosmos company run by Gerard Pique for $3bn (£2.35bn) over 25 years, so the ATP have to negotiate with the Barcelona star rather than the federation, and Pique is still learning about the internal politics of tennis.It was striking at the ATP launch of their event here on Thursday that the new venture has the backing of all the world’s best players, while the future of the Davis Cup – played for national pride but no money or points – remains the game’s Brexit conundrum: to remain or to leave. So much tennis, so little time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a71bb98868f1f29aa34efa816ab64c5702e2ab8c/0_643_5114_3069/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fff7b0c739aba68785796cfd69cfe823","title":"world chess championship game five magnus carlsen fabiano caruana","story":"Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana played to a fifth draw in as many games on Thursday in the latest episode of their world championship showdown in London, as the Norwegian champion adroitly weathered early fireworks to negotiate a peaceful result after 34 moves and three-and-a-quarter hours.Caruana, playing with the white pieces, led with a Rossolimo (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6), marking the third time in a week the players opened with the Sicilian variation. The American was first to deviate with 4. O-O, then prompted gasps with 6. b4!?, a highly aggressive move offering a pawn sacrifice with the hope of creating pressure and confusion and, ideally, winning chances in the long term.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw.

Bxa1 d6 11. bxc5 Ne7 12. Qe2 b4 13. Qc4). Caruana played at an incredible pace during the first act, taking no longer than 66 seconds to complete any of his opening 13 moves, demonstrating a formidable depth of preparation.The American required more than 31 minutes before settling on 19. Bc3, taking extra care to not squander whatever advantage remained from his opening surprise – even if the computers indicated a level and drawish position by that point. No real progress was made over the next hour and the players shook hands after another bloodless draw.Caruana’s early 6. b4!? crowd-pleaser, a Molotov cocktail in a match that had adhered to a safe, conservative tenor in the days since Friday’s exciting opener, was the predictable focus of discussion at the post-game press conference.“Well, this line is really interesting and if black is cooperative it can get very exciting,” Caruana said. “But Magnus knew the line quite well and I think played in a very logical way.”The world No 1 said he had not been bothered about Caruana’s start. “To be honest I was pretty happy about the opening,” he said. “I felt as though after it calmed down, only black could ever really be better. But I couldn’t find a way to push it.”The general thinking was that Caruana faced extra pressure on Thursday as white. That’s because Carlsen, who won the draw and elected to play Game 1 as black, will get to play back-to-back contests on Friday and Sunday as white under the regulations, which dictate the rotation of the colors is reversed at the midpoint of the match.He added: “I can only play for a win if I get something and I can only really be disappointed that I missed a chance if I get some sort of chance in the game. And if a game is like this where we both play more or less correctly and neither of us makes a serious mistake, I don’t think that I can really be disappointed.”Carlsen admitted he was looking forward to consecutive games as white.“It’s like any round-robin tournament,” the Norwegian champion said. “If you have a double black or a double white, you kind of single that out when the tournament starts. That is either your opportunity to strike or when you’re at your most vulnerable. I am looking forward to it, obviously, and we’ll see what happens.“But most of all I’m just more or less happy with the way things are going with black as it’s clear to the naked eye there is serious room for improvement at this point.”Thursday’s contest took place two days after the apparent bombshell intel blunder that’s threatened to overshadow the match itself, where a short video clip revealing confidential details of Caruana’s preparation was uploaded to the Saint Louis Chess Club’s YouTube channel before it was quickly taken down, but not before crucial screen shots were captured and disseminated on social media.The footage included pictures of an open laptop with a list of openings allegedly researched by the world No 2 along with the identities of three grandmasters – Leinier Domínguez, Alejandro Ramírez and Ioan-Cristian Chirila – who could potentially be working as seconds in the challenger’s camp.Speculation over whether it was a ghastly error by Caruana’s club or a deliberate misinformation campaign intended to spread false intelligence to the Carlsen camp have swirled since the video entered the public domain.NRK reported on Thursday that while Carlsen was aware of the video’s existence ahead of Tuesday’s fourth game (though he hadn’t seen it), Caruana’s team opted to wait until after play ended to inform the American of the development, lest it interfere with his mental state.“They must have assumed that he was unable to handle this shortly before the game,” Norwegian international master Torstein Bae told the network. “Then they think they should give it to him afterwards. It must also mean that the information is not so crucial.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9050faa46c24c29ec0ee9eabde1390343c0e2300/0_176_5273_3164/master/5273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a0bd9898b1873c3674a75a70872280","title":"amazon and high street chains kick off black friday early","story":"Britons are expected to spend more than £10bn during November discount eventAmazon has fired the starting gun on Black Friday, the US tradition that has become a near-fortnight long £10bn shopping extravaganza in the UK.The web giant has been joined by other high street street names, including Argos and Currys PC World, in making an early start to the bargain shopping event on Friday 23 November.Amazon and some big chains have lined up discounts on tens of thousands of products – from large-screen 4K HD TVs, wireless speakers, headphones to laptops – to entice reluctant Britons to start spending from this Friday.The high street crisis, from which 85,000 retail jobs have disappeared in the first nine months of this year, means shoppers have not had to wait until November to get their hands on a bargain as desperate retailers cut prices to attract shoppers. But the promotions planned between now and Christmas will be key to the fortunes of retail chains that make the bulk of their profits at this time of year.“We have seen more clothing retailers participating in the event each year and while a number of big names such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer are not participating, online stores such as Asos, boohoo and Gymshark are encouraging consumers to move online to get a discount.”When Black Friday arrived in the UK five years ago, the promise of a bargain led to scuffles as shoppers scrambled to pick up deals. But in recent years the event has become more sedate as shoppers surf the internet from their sofa to find the best deals, particularly on coveted home appliances and personal gadgetry such as smartphones and fitness trackers.A number of chains, including M\u0026ampS, have turned their back on Black Friday as it puts pressure on them to cut prices at what should be the industry’s most profitable time.Amazon is billing this year’s wave of promotions as its “biggest ever Black Friday sale” with tens of thousands of “lightning deals” that offer bargains in limited quantities. The biggest reductions include a 55in Philips 4K Ultra HD TV for £1,199 – a £300 discount – and more than £100 off DeLonghi coffee machines.In previous years shoppers have sat on their hands in October and splashed out in the Black Friday sales. This trend showed up in the monthly ONS figures with retail sales falling last month as shoppers kept a tight rein on spending amid the growing Brexit uncertainty.“It highlights how Black Friday is encouraging shoppers to hold back buying full-price items and heavily impacting retailer sales in the weeks prior to the event,” said Mills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4894b3c6554ce70f5125a7166270a7c0b01f3c48/28_901_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97fdc4d8ef9234d7e079dc830a0e0c66","title":"which apple macbook pro laptop should i buy","story":"Mary needs to replace her 2009 MacBook Pro but is overwhelmed by the options. Which is the best choice? I have soldiered on with a 2009 MacBook Pro, which I use for internet access, social media, photos, and my research. But in order to access the university library remotely, I have to use an up-to-date operating system, and my Mac is so old I can no longer update it.So, I need to buy a new MacBook, but I am overwhelmed by the options. Do I need a Touch Bar? How much memory and SSD do I need? MaryFollowing the product refresh on 30 October, Apple has four MacBooks that do much the same job. The good news is that, if you can survive on a 2009 MacBook Pro, any of them would be fine for your purposes. The bad news is that they all have features that would put me off buying them, though, with luck, they won’t necessarily put you off.However, I do think it’s essential to visit an Apple Store or other stockist so that you can compare at least two 13in MacBooks side by side. These are the old MacBook Air (best keyboard, worst screen) and the MacBook Pro (horrible keyboard, great screen).I can tell you which chips are faster, and so on, but your personal experience will be dominated by the quality of the keyboard and screen. A blog post can’t tell you which ones you will like, or where you would prefer to make compromises.For me, the biggest problem with the new MacBooks is the butterfly keyboard, which was first introduced with the 12in MacBook in 2015. The second version appeared in MacBook Pros, where a number of users had keyboard failures due to dust or detritus getting under the keys. The latest MacBooks have a third version with extra sealing to keep out dust. We have yet to see how it stands up over time.Apart from that, I find the butterfly keyboard provides a horrible typing experience. I learned to touch-type on typewriters, and I prefer keyboards with mechanical keys with lots of travel. Butterfly keys have almost no travel. This would push me towards the old MacBook Air, which has a very good keyboard by laptop standards.Sadly, the old MacBook Air has other problems. In particular, the touchpad and screen are worse than the ones in the new MacBook Air. (They’re not bad, but they are not as good.)Happily, tastes vary. Some people prefer flat, unresponsive keyboards, and you may find you like the butterfly keyboard. If so, it makes your choice easier. I just think you need to give it a serious go – type a few hundred words on it – before you commit to using it all day every day … or carrying an external USB keyboard around.You don’t need a Touch Bar. In fact, no one really needs a Touch Bar. Either way, they are only fitted to the more expensive MacBook Pros, and I assume you’re not interested in buying a much more expensive MacBook than you need.The 13in mid-2009 MacBook Pro had an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, which is dire by today’s standards. The base model only had 2GB of memory (expandable to 8GB) and a 160GB hard drive, though custom upgrades included 128GB and 256GB SSDs. The lowliest MacBook you can buy today will have better specifications.Unfortunately, you cannot upgrade today’s MacBooks, so you have to buy as much power as you will ever need. For longevity, it would be better to have 16GB of memory and a 256GB or larger SSD, but Apple charges a huge premium for these upgrades.Fortunately, MacBooks hold their value quite well, so the alternative is to go for the base spec and, if you find you need more power, sell it and buy a new one.There is a non-obvious problem in that two of your possible MacBooks have Intel Core M processors, which compromise on speed to provide better battery life. Apple first tried this with the 1.1GHz dual-core M-5Y31 chip used in the 2015 MacBook (12in screen). Today, Core M chips are used not only in 12in MacBooks, but also in the latest MacBook Airs.It’s not obvious because Intel changed its naming scheme. People who might have been put off by the “Core M” designation probably won’t notice that they are getting a Y series chip – specifically, a Core i5-8210Y – instead of the more powerful U series chips used in mainstream laptops.I have nothing against Core MY series chips, and my 8GB128GB touch-screen Lenovo Yoga 700 has the same Core M3-6Y30 used in some MacBooks. The difference is that it’s a machine for casualholiday use, not my main system and it only cost me £339.99. I wouldn’t buy one as my main machine, and charging £1,200 for one is ridiculous.A Core i5-8210Y should be fast enough for your light uses – which may grow over time – but it’s still poor value for money in a MacBook Air.Apple has retained the old 13in MacBook Air, and it looks the best value for money at £949, despite its fifth-generation Core i5-5350U processor and non-retina screen. It has, in my view, the best keyboard, and it still has good old-fashioned ports, including an SD card slot and a magsafe connector. In all other respects, the new MacBook Air (2018) is far superior.The old 12in MacBook is still available, but it’s underpowered and overpriced, with the 1.2GHz Core M3-7Y32 version (2017) costing £1,249. The only reason for considering this machine is that it’s the smallest and lightest (0.92kg) MacBook you can get.The new 13in MacBook Air is smaller and lighter than the old version, has a far superior screen, a bigger force-touch trackpad, and better speakers. It’s also more expensive at £1,199. The drawbacks include the butterfly keyboard and the Core MY series processor.Finally, there’s the 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar (mid-2017), which provides a faster seventh-generation 2.3GHz Core i5 (7360U) processor, much better graphics and better colour rendering for an extra £50, ie £1,249. The Pro also has a brighter screen – 500 nits instead of 300 nits – which should be much better for outdoor use. You lose the Air’s wedge shape, which is more comfortable for typing, but the Pro isn’t significantly heavier than the new Air (1.37kg vs 1.25kg).I’d like the MacBook Pro more if it had the old Air keyboard, but it seems to me it’s the best buy – if you can afford it. I also think it’s your best bet for future operating system updates.Upgrades are, as mentioned, expensive. Increasing the Pro’s 8GB of memory to 16GB costs £180, and upgrading the 128GB SSD to 256GB costs £200, so the spec you really want costs £1,629. Adding AppleCare bumps the final price up to £1,878.It’s a lot of money, but think of it as £1 a day over five years and it won’t feel so bad.As a graduate student, you should qualify for an educational discount, which will bring down the price. Check to find out whether it’s best to do this via your university, online, or at an Apple Store.Apple also offers trade-ins on old equipment via its GiveBack scheme. I can’t tell how much you’d get without the serial number of your MacBook Pro. It’s probably not a lot, but at least the old warhorse would get recycled properly.Have you got a question?

What if it had focused on some of the artist’s less endearing moments?The 2018 John Lewis ad is heartwarming. Elton John sits alone at his piano, playing Your Song while moments of his life flash before his eyes. He sings in a stadium, he sings in the studio, he sings in a pub, he sings at a school concert. It’s a very sweet advert with a very simple message: somebody better call Elton John an ambulance right away, because this is exactly the sort of thing that happens right before you die.In fact, the advert is probably too heartwarming. Just a few weeks ago, the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody was heavily criticised for its toothless portrayal of Freddie Mercury’s worst excesses, and the same could be said for the John Lewis advert. Elton John isn’t a great pop star because he sings songs about little dancers, crocodiles that rock and being able to stand up. No, Elton John is a great pop star because he is knotty and complicated and, well, a bit of a dick sometimes.If the John Lewis Christmas ad is going to go down as a lasting tribute to Elton’s career – and, boy, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d write – then it should have picked some better memories for him to have. Luckily for you, I have written a new version. There is still time to make this before Christmas, John Lewis.It is Christmas morning. Elton John sits alone at his piano, wistfully tapping out opening notes of Your Song. He looks old and vulnerable. He blinks. He swallows. Then, as the melody soars beneath his fingers, he drifts into a reverie and is transported to …Las Vegas, March 2018. Elton John is in the middle of his Million Dollar Piano residency, playing Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting for all it’s worth. But something is troubling him. He leans over to look at an audience member he invited onstage. “Fuck off,” he mouths. Ten seconds later, more aggrieved, he mouths it again, then points angrily, then stops playing, then leaves the stage in a huff. When he returns, he tells the entire audience “You fucked it up”, before he spins away again, lost in a dream.Taiwan, 2004. Elton John’s private plane touches down in Taipei. It’s distant and exotic, just one of many astonishing places that Elton has visited as a direct consequence of his mother scrimping and saving for a piano all those years ago. He is swarmed by photographers, amazed that such a global star is visiting their country. His response? “Rude, vile pigs! Do you know what that means? Rude, vile pigs! That’s what all of you are.” An appalled photographer shouts: “Get out of Taiwan!” To which Elton replies: “We’d love to get out of Taiwan if it’s full of people like you. Pig! Pig!” The strings soar as he is swept even further into a river of nostalgia.New York, March 2000. Elton John becomes upset during a performance of his own musical and storms out.France, 1996. A woman says “Yoo-hoo” to Elton John while he is playing tennis. In response, Elton storms off the court. “I’m never coming to the south of France again,” he seethes.London, the 1980s. After spending the last few days fully awake, Elton John phones one of his employees and angrily orders him to somehow make London less windy.The music now reaches a crescendo, and then …It’s Christmas morning again. Elton finishes playing Your Song and, with a nostalgic tear in his eye, gently shuts the lid. But then he notices the cameraman in his peripheral vision and loses his temper, screaming profanities and flinging vases until the cameraman is forced to escape and flee for his life. Finally, the new slogan appears: “John Lewis. If we can deal with him, we can deal with you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c739a96ffd27c5235163bde6a09f0b67ef64bf/0_35_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbe9c2ad93672369fadf83db9caf0193","title":"beto orourke medium blogpost analysis running","story":"The Texas Democrat published a stream of consciousness Medium post about – what else? – the act of running. Here’s what he said, and what we think he meantAs if the punk band, skateboard and photos of him in a sundress weren’t evidence enough, Beto O’Rourke has solidified his role as the most Gen-X dude alive by dusting off another signifier of the Y2K era: a meandering, hastily proofread blogpost about his feelings.As many have pointed out online, the post about running – possibly a thinly veiled allegory about what’s to come for the exciting Democratic candidate who recently over-performed in his race for a Senate seat against Republican Ted Cruz – reads like the stream of consciousness work of a modernist author.Only it’s, you know, not exactly a towering literary achievement. O’Rourke does have a very creative way of spelling “Massachusettes”, which may be a bit of poetic license.Typically, if this were any other bro in a creative writing class, we wouldn’t bother spending much time parsing the text’s meaning. But considering it’s the work of a man a lot of people think might have a chance to be president someday, we’ll indulge him this time.Here’s what he said, and what we think he meant. As the blogpost opens, we find O’Rourke going about his morning routine, outfitting himself in warm clothing, like a warrior donning his armor, to withstand the harsh reception he is sure to face. From the elements, yes, but also from the political climate. What is he preparing for? A run.Here O’Rourke references the direction from which he is being attacked. From the right side, which is clear enough, and blowing due south, there being few places in the country further south than his home state of Texas. He will come in for a lot more of that in the years to come if he is intending to run for president.His being the first footprints in fresh snow is too sophisticated a metaphor for me to unpack here, sorry.As for “the crazies” line, is this man giving voice to the idea that you’d have to be a glutton for punishment to run against Trump?O’Rourke mentions faces and snow eight and nine times, respectively, throughout, which is clearly a tacit admission he has a cocaine problem. JUST KIDDING. But there does seem to be hidden meaning in the way he describes various figures handling the cold on the most vulnerable part of the body.As he runs toward the Washington Monument – the most iconic symbol of George Washington, the man synonymous with American leadership – he thinks about turning around. Before long he comes across a man who has decided to do just that, shielding his face, as if in weakness, a sign of giving up. The man he sees is the version of himself, having decided he isn’t up to the task.To paraphrase Joyce: “On a snowy winter morning, he is young Beto, a mirror within a mirror, he beholdeth himself, the young figure of then is seen, precious manly, walking on a nipping morning.”Here he sees a third man, not the one turning away, not the one who’s ducked, momentarily as he has, behind the cover of the trees, but one embracing it all, without compunction or caution.Soon he ascends the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument dedicated to the man widely considered our greatest president. He reads his words, and describes their effect on his physical body. If the cold is a symbol of the negative throughout, of fear, Lincoln’s words are the opposite: they bring literal warmth to his blood.Quoting Lincoln here, this could mean a lot of things but let’s just go with saying it’s a dig at Cruz, the big religious windbag.If the results of the midterm elections have shown us anything, it’s that the suffering of the Trump era isn’t quite as inevitable as it may have seemed. The winds have changed. As any runner will tell you, running with the wind makes you go a lot faster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533645b485d7865be44e819106cfbd91e35cd46b/0_175_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fa3743fea5f652c2d7b967d3df219ca","title":"florida senate race hand recount governor","story":"Republican Ron DeSantis appears to have won governor’s race over Andrew GillumFlorida’s election torment is set to continue after officials ordered a hand recount of ballots in the knife-edge US Senate race between the Republican Rick Scott and the Democrat Bill Nelson.After a troubled machine recount finished on Thursday, Scott had a lead of 12,603 votes, or 0.15 percentage points – within the threshold of 0.25 points that by state law triggers a manual recount.But the eagerly watched race for governor appeared to be over, with the Republican Ron DeSantis virtually assured of victory over Democrat Andrew Gillum, according to unofficial results posted on the Florida secretary of state’s website. Gillum, bidding to become the state’s first African American governor, did not have enough votes to force a manual recount.Scott, currently the state’s governor, tweeted: “With the statewide machine recount finished, our margin of victory has increased by nearly 1000 votes. @SenBillNelson, it’s time to admit this race is over.”But there was no sign of Nelson throwing in the towel. His lead campaign lawyer, Marc Elias, announced a lawsuit against Palm Beach county, which failed to meet the recount deadline due to malfunctioning equipment.“We have sued Palm Beach County and the Florida Sec of State to require a hand count of all ballots in the county due to systematic machine failure during the machine recount,” he tweeted.Elias also noted that Hillsborough and Broward counties were reporting incomplete results. “We are monitoring the situation but we will take steps to ensure that every lawful vote is counted.”Around eight million people voted in Florida’s midterm elections. Initial counts before the recount showed Scott with a narrow lead over incumbent senator Nelson.In beleaguered Broward county, the recounts ended on Thursday with minutes to spare before the 3pm deadline. Brenda Snipes, the county’s widely criticised elections supervisor, told reporters: “We are excited to be at this point.”But she admitted that the total included 23 invalid provisional ballots that were mistakenly mixed in with valid ones and were now impossible to separate.In a mark of the level of chaos prevailing in Florida for the past eight days, she acknowledged that, if the 23 votes proved decisive in any of the races, “that will be a proper election contest issue”, but she felt it would be unfair to disenfranchise the 182 who did vote. However, the batch of 205 will remain “segregated” from the rest of the election in case of challenges.Broward county is a Democratic stronghold. In the Senate, Scott polled 210,513 votes there, while Nelson gained 469,949 votes. In the first count, the figures were Scott 211,119, Nelson 471,334.For the governorship, DeSantis received 221,252 votes, while Gillum noted 480,304. In the first count, the figures were DeSantis 221,873, Gillum 481,677.On Thursday, the US district judge Mark Walker cleared the way to include ballots from as many as 5,000 people across the state who submitted ballots by mail that were rejected by election officials.Amid tension and confusion, counties have until Sunday to inspect the ballots that did not record a vote when put through the machines. Those ballots are re-examined to see whether the voter skipped the race or marked the ballot in a way that the machines cannot read but can be deciphered. The election will be certified on Tuesday, a full week after the election.The drawn-out recounts have revived uncomfortable memories of the disputed 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore, which ended only after the US supreme court stopped the counting and in effect put Bush in the White House."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d1ed94efa7ede5c7074aba8731f9514c986143b/0_422_924_554/master/924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2789928c95eb6ff43c58bc4a12be2bfa","title":"canada dying man wish preserve tattoos","story":"Chris Wenzel hoped his children could appreciate the intricate designs that adorned his body after his death. An Ohio-based company made it happenIt was a dying Canadian man’s wish that the tattoos that covered much of his body should outlive him.Chris Wenzel of Saskatoon hoped his children, and even maybe his grandchildren, would one day be able to appreciate the intricate designs.“He fell in love with art and had such a passion for tattoos,” his wife, Cheryl Wenzel, told the Canadian Press. “He would say he was a slave to the needle because he loved to tattoo so much.”And in his final months, Wenzel, a well-known tattoo artist, discovered an Ohio-based company that could potentially make his wish a reality.When he died at the end of October, at the age of 41, Cheryl quickly contacted Save My Ink Forever, which specializes in removing and preserving tattooed skin.Operated by father-son team Michael and Kyle Sherwood, the company provides tools, directions and paperwork to ensure the skin is carefully removed and preserved shortly after death. They then use a propriety process to preserve the designs.In Wenzel’s case, the estimated fee for preserving the many tattoos which covered much of his upper torso, exceeded C$80,000 ($60,635).“I don’t care what it takes. I’m going to get this done for him,” she told the Canadian Press.Typically, Sherwood’s company works with small tattoos. But with Wenzel, Sherwood travelled to Saskatoon to personally oversee the job which he called “groundbreaking” in an interview with the Canadian Press. Sherwood was able to remove seven distinct pieces of art from Wenzel, including from the chest, back, arms and legs.Sherwood, a trained mortician, won’t preserve tattoos from the face or genitals, nor will they work on any tattoos that aren’t designed by professionals. To date, the company has successfully preserved more than 100 designs.The family plans to present the preserved tattoos to the public at an upcoming tattoo expo in the spring.Cheryl Wenzel also told Chris before he died that she also intended to preserve her own tattoos, according to CTV News.“I know one day I’ll be hanging here with my husband,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38235d689265870214e38cdccf23651bae3bfeed/75_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6660810234a85d06fd9a21a365c1d2","title":"silvio santos sbt owner claudia leitte","story":"Viewers demand Silvio Santos be removed after telling Claudia Leitte he couldn’t hug her because it would make him ‘excited’He is one of South America’s most powerful TV tycoons, an 87-year-old media mogul who has for decades been a fixture on Brazilian screens.But many viewers are now demanding that Silvio Santos, the celebrity owner of Brazil’s SBT network, be pulled off the air after he made the latest in a series of improper and offensive remarks to a guest.During an telethon benefiting disabled children last weekend, Santos told Claudia Leitte, one of Brazil’s most famous singers, that he couldn’t hug her because it would make him “excited”.“The way you are dressed it makes me want to get up out of my seat, have a few beers and then … seek comfort,” he smirked, prompting uneasy laughter from the studio audience and a grimace from the singer.Santos has a reputation for his infelicitous and vulgar remarks: he once declined to dance with Brazilian pop star Anitta because, he said, it would arouse him he told a woman from a troupe of plus size dancers she was pretty despite being its only black member and asked a small child if she preferred sex, money or power – all on live television.Two days after the programme aired, Leitte challenged Santos in a Facebook post. “We see an example of what happens with many women every day, in many places. This is rampant, cruel painful and scary,” she wrote. “We are the victims.”Coming after last month’s election victory of far-right president-elect Jair Bolsonaro, the storm has exposed some of Brazil’s social faultlines.Conservatives – including the president-elect – say they want to return to a more “traditional” past, but Bolsonaro’s rise has prompted an outspoken reaction from Brazilians who despair at his sexist and authoritarian attitudes.Many see Santos as part of the same macho mindset.“Silvio Santos represents a patriarchal culture, a sexist culture,” said Jacqueline Pitanguy, a sociologist and director of human rights, non-profit group CEPIA. “It is clearly a case of sexual harassment.”Video of the incident clearly shows Leitte’s discomfort when Santos said: “You are no longer a pretty little blonde. Now you are a sexy, provocative woman.” “What we saw on TV was a pathetic scene of a woman being embarrassed,” said Regina Navarro Lins, a TV psychologist and writer. “How long will women have to put up with this?”In an Instagram post, the actor Bruna Marquezine said: “When a presenter assaults a singer on national network, we can see how violence is normalized in our society. It’s become so normal we don’t know now how to react. Shame, fear of retaliation and exposure paralyze us. But you have to remember: THIS IS NOT NORMAL.”Bolsonaro has not commented on the incident, but later phoned into the telethon, telling a delighted Santos he was a fan.Many viewers supported a national icon they said was doing his job as an entertainer. Santos’s daughter, Daniela Beyruti, defended her “super father” on Instagram, saying she missed old-style TV, with “lots of joking and little embarrassment”.A spokeswoman for SBT said neither the channel nor Santos would comment.Santos started out as a street vendor, launched the Silvio Santos Programme in 1963, selling products via competitions, and set up his SBT network during Brazil’s military regime.Days before the telethon, SBT screened patriotic interludes of postcard Brazil images, one of which bore the slogan “Brazil, love it or leave it” – a phrase used during the dark days of the military dictatorship Bolsonaro has praised. The interludes were removed after complaints.“I thought this was shocking,” said Maurício Stycer, a TV critic who has written a Santos biography. “He needs to get up to date.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Pivotal moment in history of Northern Ireland: Bridge to barricades of the pastConcern in Dublin for May\u0026rsquos prospects as ministers resign and MPs move to oust herDead man was in his 40s and had just returned home from Ireland football matchChief of Staff says he has \u0026lsquounique\u0026rsquo perspective to give Pay CommissionDublin Midlands Hospital Group working with HSE after \u0026lsquoisolated\u0026rsquo incidentBusiness leaders in Belfast tell Karen Bradley \u0026lsquoany deal is better than no deal\u0026rsquoPatients\u0026rsquo daycare payments, covering the cost of a meal and transport, stolenKashimbo Musonda was dismissed from her post at Waterford University Hospital in 2017Desmond Duffy said he \u0026lsquocovered up\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquodenied\u0026rsquo abusive relationship with Desmond Sullivan\u0026lsquoSerious concerns about the nature and extent of development for this site\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Bord Plean\u0026aacutelaAngela Merkel insists alternative to deal agreed this week is disorderly BrexitAccused stole the money from 29 accounts of relatives and deceased members of Synergy Credit Union in North Cork over a seven-year period, court hearsJudge \u0026lsquoregretfully\u0026rsquo turns down application after garda\u0026iacute warn of \u0026lsquopowder keg\u0026rsquo situationAction against HSE over alleged delay in cancer diagnosis will be heard in JanuaryRosita Boland wins journalist of the year for Ann Lovett boyfriend interviewBrexit secretary Dominic Raab resigns along with seven others after release of draft dealNineteen patients with genetic emphysema will continue receiving key medicationBan on piercings proposed amid fears they make youngsters vulnerable to abuse"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3699340.1542315316!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern secretary sticks by theresa may and draft deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKaren Bradley speaks during a press conference at the Grand Central Hotel after meeting  business leaders to discuss the draft Brexit deal.  Photograph:  David YoungPA WireNorthern Secretary Karen Bradley has called on politicians to apply “cool heads” and support the draft Brexit deal in the UK’s “national interest”.Ms Bradley, after meeting a number of Northern Ireland business leaders in Belfast on Thursday evening, also expressed strong support for the British prime minister Theresa May. “I support the prime minister – there is no better person to do this job. I supported her leadership in 2016 because this is a woman who gets the job done, this is a woman who has gone out and negotiated hard,” she said.Ms Bradley, after hearing business leaders tell her “any deal is better than no deal”, rejected claims that the Brexit agreement was dead and that Northern Ireland had been sold out. “People need to understand this is the deal on the table this is the deal that the 27 member states are prepared to sign up to,” she said.“Northern Ireland will not be in the Single Market, it will not be in the Customs Union, it will be leaving along with the whole of the United Kingdom on March 29th next year.” Ms Bradley expressed satisfaction with her meeting with some 20 business leaders who are members of Northern Ireland’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representing companies and big employers such as Allstate Northern Ireland Diageo Asda BT SSE Airtricity Dale Farm and Danske Bank.She said: “It’s very clear from the conversations that I have just had that actually what businesses and people in Northern Ireland want is politicians to come together and do the right thing, think about the national interest and support the deal so we can leave the European Union on March 29th next year in a measured, organised, co-ordinated way that is right for the United Kingdom and the people of Northern Ireland.” She believed the people of Northern Ireland had an important part to play in persuading parties such as the DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party that the draft Brexit deal was better than no deal.“I think the people of Northern Ireland, when they see that this is a good deal for the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, should tell all their politicians exactly that,” she said.After the meeting, John Healy, vice-president of the Northern Ireland Chamber, said: “It is clear that businesses recognise the huge efforts made by the prime minister and across government to reach this milestone.” Mr Healy, who is managing director of Allstate Northern Ireland, the American insurance company that employs 2,300 people in the North, added: “It is NI Chamber’s opinion that any deal is better than no deal for business.” He said the chamber would study the proposed deal carefully. “With people’s livelihoods and the future prospects for many companies in the balance, more time is required to deliberate the real-world implications of this agreement over the coming days.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesThe Conservative revolt against Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal has taken the gloss off the Irish Government’s happiness at securing a draft treaty that met and exceeded its hopes, and has thrown the future of the backstop into doubt once again.Senior Government sources confessed on Thursday that they were watching half in horror, half in fascination as the procession of resignations gave way to the counting of letters requesting a vote of confidence in Mrs May as Tory leader.Many in Dublin expressed admiration for Mrs May’s seemingly indestructible determination to keep going no matter what is thrown at her. Few, however, express much confidence in her chances of success.Less than 24 hours earlier, it had all looked a lot different. On Wednesday night, following the publication of the text of the draft treaty, there was quiet (and in some cases, not so quiet) delight in Irish Government circles that the Border backstop had been included in such strong terms. Indeed, with the agreement introducing a UK-wide backstop, it was better than Dublin had hoped for most of the negotiations.At his press conference in Government Buildings on Wednesday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described it as “one of the better days in politics”.The election lobby in Fine Gael believed that the outcome would enhance Mr Varadkar’s standing politically, and talk of an early election bounced around Leinster House, as it does with every decent poll for Fine Gael or every hint of a breakthrough in Europe.However, at a meeting of Fine Gael Ministers on Wednesday night, during a wide-ranging discussion on the political situation and the talks on the confidence-and-supply agreement, Mr Varadkar told them the window for a pre-Christmas election had closed. In reality, it was never open very wide. But a Brexit victory would be a political boost for the Government, and everyone – inside and outside the administration – knows it.The truth is that the draft treaty was a significant achievement for the Government and the officials and diplomats who work for it.But that may come to naught if the UK – by whatever route – walks away from the agreement it made in Brussels earlier this week.If the UK’s commitment to the draft treaty is destroyed by the machinations of the Tory party and the ambition of the British Labour party to force a general election, several senior sources at political and official level in Dublin believe that probably means the prospect of a soft, managed Brexit has evaporated.The choice then will be between a hard Brexit next March and a second referendum that could cancel Brexit completely – an all-or-nothing gamble that both thrills and terrifies Dublin."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

TopshopArcadia will fulfil the existing orders,” he said.Beyoncé faced calls to cut her business links with Sir Philip after Lord Hain used parliamentary privilege last month to name him as the businessman who had obtained an injunction preventing the Daily  reporting details of gagging orders signed by some of his alleged victims.Yasmeen Hassan, from the campaign group Equality Now, said: “Beyoncé has put herself forward as a women’s rights activist. She and her team need to look closely at these allegations.”Another activist, Nimco Ali, said: “Beyoncé should say, ‘I don’t want to work with Philip Green’.”Ivy Park, named after the singer’s daughter, Blue Ivy, sells items such as hoodies and leggings, part of a trend towards so-called ‘athleisure’.It was previewed at Topshop’s Oxford Street store in April 2016, with Beyoncé, who is estimated to be worth £258million, saying at the time: “My goal with Ivy Park is to push the boundaries of athletic wear.”That was days before the BHS scandal erupted, engulfing Sir Philip and his entire business empire.The creation of Ivy Park had been announced almost two years prior to that, Beyoncé saying: “I have always loved Topshop for their fashion credentials and forward thinking.”Sir Philip was subsequently pictured with his arm around her at the opening of Topshop’s New York store.Their relationship dates back even further, with Beyoncé having sung at his son Brandon’s bar mitzvah in 2005.Ivy Park items were still being advertised on Topshop’s website yesterday, including a £42 sweatshirt, a £149 bomber jacket, £139 joggers and a £20 sleeveless tank top.The range, which was expected to remain available in-store, is also sold via Selfridges, Asos, JD Sports and Vosins.Earlier this week, Mr Cowell said he would have “regretted” not buying out Sir Philip, who he said he “stopped talking” to three years ago.Last month, Topshop was forced to cancel the launch party for its latest collection after a designer, Michael Halpern, pulled out over the on-going scandal.A fashion source said of Mr Halpern’s decision: “His brand is about female empowerment. That’s his ethos. He couldn’t go ahead with this — it wouldn’t be a good look.”Sir Philip has denied any unlawful sexual or racist behaviour and has insisted he had only ever engaged in “banter” with employees.Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May clings on after devastating day of ministerial resignations over planTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit draft withdrawal agreement - read in fullWho could replace Theresa May as Tory leader?

Previously they had only attempted to cross the Channel in rickety makeshift vessels, even canoes, she said.French authorities have had to change tactics in the past 12 months, Lt Parrot said, with a far more joined-up approach between maritime authorities, border forces and intelligence agencies. She said there was close cooperation between French and British authorities and work was ongoing to identify international smuggling rings.On Tuesday afternoon, seven suspected migrants were also found in a lorry arriving from France at Dover docks. One person needed medical treatment on arrival.Then on Wednesday, in the space of just over 12 hours, three groups of migrants risked their lives crossing some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world in small open boats in a desperate bid to reach Britain. Marine experts say if the attempts continue there will be deaths.At 4.30am nine Iranian migrants - including a woman and a four old boy - were rescued from a Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat (RHIB) after the Coastguard and RNLI were scrambled to help a vessel reportedly in distress in the south west shipping lane. They escorted the RHIB to Dover\u0027s Western Docks where they were met by Border Force and immigration officials.Border Force was next alerted at 9.15am by the Coastguard and RNLI to a small fishing vessel which had rescued 10 Iranian men off the Kent Coast. The tiny white boat, only designed to carry four people, was escorted into Dover by a lifeboat where it was met by Border Force officers.Finally, at 2pm the crew of a Gas Tanker ship spotted a RHIB in a shipping lane off Ramsgate, Kent. Five people were picked up and taken on board the vessel, which then headed to Falmouth to hand the iniduals over to Border Force officials.One highly experienced sailor, who did not want to be named, said: If this does not stop now there will be deaths, the Lifeboat crews will be picking up bodies out of the water rather than cold people on dinghies.Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke said: To see so many brazen attempts to break into Britain in one week is unprecedented and deeply concerning.That people are taking the risk of crossing such a busy shipping route on small craft - some even with young children on board - shows just how desperate they are.The Home Office must act urgently to tackle this growing problem by boosting our borders budget and the number of skilled officers.A Home Office spokesman said: We are alert to the risk posed by people attempting to reach the UK illegally via small boats.This year we have increased the number of coastal patrol vessels and, in light of recent events, have stepped up deployments along the South-East coast.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May clings on after devastating day of ministerial resignations over planTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit draft withdrawal agreement - read in fullWho could replace Theresa May as Tory leader?

He was a real lump.I felt discomfort as soon as he sat down because I was pinned against the side of the cabin. I asked whether they could move him or move me but it was a full flight and they decided not to move me to a crew member\u0027s seat because I\u0027d have to keep on getting up to allow them to get to the galley.Mr Prosser\u0026#39s case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on FridayThey said there wasn\u0027t anything they could do so I said I wanted to make a formal complaint which I did with the on-board customer services rep.I had no choice but to go back to my seat and the discomfort at being squashed up against the cabin soon turned to agony.He is claiming between £5,000 and £10,000 as general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity.The case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on Friday.Before the hearing, a spokesman for BA said: As the case is subject to ongoing proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May clings on after devastating day of ministerial resignations over planTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit draft withdrawal agreement - read in fullWho could replace Theresa May as Tory leader?

When asked about Japanese nuclear facilities and malicious software, Sakurada said USBs were “basically never used” in the utility systems. Mr Sakurada was brought into PM Shinzo Abe\u0026#39s cabinet as part of a reshuffle following his re-election as party leaderAides, sensing their minister was poorly briefed, could be seen rushing to give Sakurada sheets of paper with information during his exchange.Fellow MPs laughed incredulously at his replies, which were circulated widely on Japanese media and on social media.Masato Imai, an opposition MP, said “It\u0027s unbelievable that someone who has not touched computers is responsible for cyber security policies.”Mr Sakurada’s comments also prompted a backlash from voters on social media too. Doesn\u0027t he feel ashamed? wrote one Twitter user.Today any company president uses a PC. He doesn\u0027t even know what a USB is. Holy cow.Another joked that Sakurada was possibly working on his own kind of cyber security by avoiding computers.If a hacker targets this Minister Sakurada, they wouldn\u0027t be able to steal any information. Indeed it might be the strongest kind of security!Mr Sakurada was appointed cyber security minister just one month ago following a cabinet reshuffle after prime minister Shinzo Abe\u0027s reelection as head of his political party.In this short space of time he has already come fire for other embarrassing comments in parliament. These include mispronouncing an opposition lawmaker’s name and repeatedly stating I don\u0027t know the details when questioned about his new Olympic brief.Mr Sakurada complained after one of his unimpressive performances in parliament that he had not been given some questions in advance, blaming his stumbles the opposition MP Renho Murata. “Since there was no prior notice about the questions, I had no idea what would be asked at the session,” the Asahi newspaper quoted him as saying.When Renho asked him how much funding the central government would contribute to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, Sakurada claimed the amount would be 1,500 yen, equivalent to just $13. This is considerably less than the actual sum of 150 billion yen. He also suggested that he did not know that Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, had asked the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March to allow his country’s athletes to take part in the 2020 Games.Although the minister is not expected to have much hands-on responsibility in the handling of either cyber security or the Olympics, Mr Sakurada\u0027s high-profile stumbles are seen as an embarrassment for the prime minister.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May clings on after devastating day of ministerial resignations over planTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit draft withdrawal agreement - read in fullWho could replace Theresa May as Tory leader?

Within hours of that statement, the Prime Minister faced multiple ministerial resignations and a battering by MPs from all sides of her draft Brexit agreement in a gruelling three-hour session in the Commons.There is no doubt that the PM is one of the toughest politicians in British politics today, and deserves some credit for trying to achieve the impossible and hammer out an agreement that would satisfy everyone.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).As Amber gets ready to become Queen of Aldovia, she experiences some royal pains and struggles to see how some aspects of her life and her personality – such as her activities as a blogger – will fit within her new life.A Christmas Prince\u0026nbspwas a somewhat unexpected success for Netflix.The romantic comedy, which has all the hallmarks of its genre, became a viral hit following its release in November last year.Netflix itself poked fun at the film\u0027s most dedicate viewers in a tweet reading: To the 53 people who\u0027ve watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: Who hurt you?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

It is completely unacceptable to turn a blind eye to children playing gaming machines that are restricted to over-18s, which risks young people becoming addicted to gambling.”On Wednesday, the government made a U-turn over the timing of a cut to maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in the face of a revolt by MPs.A reduction in the top wager from £100 to just £2 to combat problem gambling will now come into force in April, after more than 70 MPs set out to sabotage Treasury plans to push it back to October.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling was down 2\u0026nbspper cent down against the euro\u0026nbspat €1.1256.The UK currency had fallen slowly before\u0026nbspthe resignations while the FTSE 100 was broadly flat\u0026nbspas markets greeted news of the Brexit deal with caution.However, the shares of UK-focused firms were pounded as\u0026nbsppolitical uncertainty increased throughout the day.Housebuilders were especially hard hit, with Persimmon and Taylor\u0026nbspWimpey\u0026nbspdown 9 per cent and 8.6 per cent respectively.Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief economist at WorldFirst\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbspAll eyes are now on Theresa May with a challenge to her leadership increasingly being viewed as the next catalyst for another sterling collapse.Brexit deal is ‘lose-lose’ and ‘damage control’, Donald Tusk saysMr Raab announced his decision to step down on Twitter saying: “Today, I have resigned as Brexit Secretary. I cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU.”Ms\u0026nbspMcVey cited concerns over the future of the Union and the lack of control over money, law, borders and trade policy.\u0026nbspMr Raab and Ms\u0026nbspMcVey\u0027s\u0026nbspdramatic resignations will plunge Ms May\u0027s leadership into fresh crisis, and come barely\u0026nbspan hour after Northern Ireland minister\u0026nbspShailesh\u0026nbspVara\u0026nbspalso decided to quit in protest at the Brexit deal.David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, predicted that other ministers would also offer their resignations making Ms May\u0027s position increasingly tenuous.It now seems probable that a vote of no confidence will be tabled, with some reports stating that the requisite 48 letters will be sent by lunchtime, he said.Unsurprisingly there’s been a swoon in sterling with the currency lower by more than 1 per cent\u0026nbspagainst all of its major peers.So far there’s been minimal reaction seen in the stock market with the FTSE rising a little in recent trade to move up to its highest level of the day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is completely unacceptable to turn a blind eye to children playing gaming machines that are restricted to over-18s, which risks young people becoming addicted to gambling.”On Wednesday, the government made a U-turn over the timing of a cut to maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in the face of a revolt by MPs.A reduction in the top wager from £100 to just £2 to combat problem gambling will now come into force in April, after more than 70 MPs set out to sabotage Treasury plans to push it back to October.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Long-form streaming television, with a completely new actor.No replacement has been announced for Cruise yet, but fans have already started discussing possible options on online discussion boards.Here are nine actors who could conceivably play the former US military police major on the small screen.The 6ft 4in, 260-pound wrestling-champion-turned-actor seems like an obvious choice whenever someone is needed to play a beefy\u0026nbspcharacter (the man played Hercules, the mythological poster child of burliness,\u0026nbspin the 2014 film of the same name).With past roles in\u0026nbspGI Joe: Retaliation\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspFast \u0026amp Furious 6, the 46-year-old Johnson\u0026nbsphas the action film experience to boot, too.Kraskinski rose to fame as the personable Jim in the US version of\u0026nbspThe Office, before stunning viewers as the athletic father in his acclaimed horror film\u0026nbspA Quiet Place.The 6ft 3in actor further leaned into\u0026nbspthis pivot by starring as former Marine Jack Ryan in the TV adaptation based on Tom Clancy\u0027s novels.But while the part confirms Krasinski\u0027s ability to credibly play an action hero, it could actually play against him. The part of Ryan has strong similarities with\u0026nbspthat of Reacher and Amazon has confirmed that the TV series based on Ryan\u0027s adventures would be renewed for a second season, meaning Krasinski\u0027s dance card could be full.The 6ft\u0026nbsp5in\u0026nbspSwedish actor rose to fame in 1985 as the brawny Russian boxer Ivan drago, Rocky\u0027s antagonist in\u0026nbspRocky IV –\u0026nbspa role he\u0027s reprising in\u0026nbspCreed II, out next week in the US.Earlier this year, Lundgren\u0026nbspstarred opposite\u0026nbspJean-Claude Van Damme\u0026nbspin the action thriller\u0026nbspBlack Water.His past credits also include the three instalments of\u0026nbspThe Expendables, the action thriller\u0026nbspIcarus, and dozens of additional action flicks.Lundgren had what it takes to play Reacher back in 1985, and he still does now.Standing at six feet tall, McConaughey\u0026nbspis in the ballpark of Reacher\u0027s height.His natural frame does appear slender than that of Reacher, but McConaughey is no stranger to extreme physical transformations in the name of a part.He was muscular in Magic Mike (though his physique was more six-pack-abs stud than strong military vet), partly bald and pudgy in\u0026nbspGold, and rake-thin in\u0026nbspDallas Buyers Club.Surely, he could use his chameleon powers to step into Reacher\u0027s shoes.The 6ft 3in\u0026nbspactor is best known for his part as the godlike superhero Thor in the Marvel Universe.Stan Lee, the late co-creator of Marvel who died on Monday, once described Thor as stronger than the strongest person.While Thor comes from the fictional realm of Asgard, there\u0027s nothing barring\u0026nbspHemsworth ​from taking his superhuman strength to more earthly planes.Standing at 6ft 4in tall, Elliott is certainly fit for a character of Reacher\u0027s dimensions.He\u0027s not blond, but then again, neither was Cruise – and if authenticity must absolutely prevail, it\u0027s nothing a quick bleach job won\u0027t fix.The Canadian actor doesn\u0027t have an extensive action resume, though, having most recently starred as John Wayne in the biographical drama\u0026nbspTrumbo\u0026nbspas well as the sitcom\u0026nbspMom.He\u0027s six feet tall and a\u0026nbspFast \u0026amp Furious\u0026nbspalum who has not only acted in, but also worked as a producer for the action franchise.\u0026nbspDiesel is also famously muscular and frequently documents his weightlifting routine on social media.Sturdy? Check.\u0026nbspSkarsgård\u0026nbspfollowed a strict diet and adhered to a rigid training routine to appear as burly as possible\u0026nbspin David Yates\u0027s\u0026nbspThe Legend of Tarzan.Action credits? Not really, but from his breakout role as vampire Eric Northman in\u0026nbspTrue Blood\u0026nbspto his Emmy-Award-winning as abusive husband Perry Wright in\u0026nbspBig Little Lies,\u0026nbspSkarsgård\u0026nbsphas shown that he certainly has range.Similarly to Krasinski, the 6ft 2in Pratt rose to fame in a slightly cosier role than his current filmography suggests.While he didn\u0027t seem particularly athletic as the hilarious Andy Dwyer in\u0026nbspParks and Recreation, Pratt packed on more muscle to appear as\u0026nbspPeter Quill  Star-Lord in\u0026nbsps of the Galaxy\u0026nbspand other Marvel films.His acting credits are currently dominated by the\u0026nbspsuperhero movies and the science fiction adventure\u0026nbspJurassic World\u0026nbspfranchise, but Pratt could conceivably branch out as Reacher.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And all editorial practices and output will conform to the standards, code of conduct and established ethos of The Independent.The Independent – which started life as a national newspaper in the UK, has, over many decades, established a global reputation for respected independent coverage of the Middle East.And now the brand has a recently strengthened its team. This new project is part of the strategic growth of the title, which has recently expanded its overseas reporting, with correspondents in Jerusalem, Delhi, Moscow and Istanbul.Further roles in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and Seattle are planned, as well as additional staff in the main London and New York newsrooms, enriching the title’s international footprint at a time when many news publishers around the world are cutting back.Zach Leonard, Managing Director, Independent Digital News and Media, said: “The Independent is known and respected around the world for the quality of its journalism and the trust and authority it has earned through 31 years. As a fully digital publisher, our influence and reach have never been greater, with a loyal user and subscriber base and a total readership in excess of 100 million each month.“This new chapter brings an opportunity to build on that heritage and increase our reach at a fascinating time of rapid change in the Middle East. We look forward to showcasing new ideas and provoking debate with new audiences across the region and beyond.”The four new websites – independentarabia, independenturdu, independentturkish and independentpersian – will launch later this year. Social media accounts will be publicised as the services are launched. The Independent will continue to publish its own content, as it does now, in the English language.By 2022, it is expected that two-thirds of the world’s population will be using smartphone technology. And much of this growth will take place outside of the more mature markets of the UK and Europe. For news publishers with a strong legacy and reputation for international reporting, this represents a huge opportunity.Dr\u0026nbspGhassan Alshibl, the Chairman of SRMG, said: “We deeply believe that SRMG, through this comprehensive partnership forged with The Independent, is growing the level of its international licensing businesses to a higher altitude. Our reach, with this multilingual project targeting hundreds of millions of readers around the world, will be farther, and our audiences will be enormously wider.“As part of SRMG’s global business initiatives we began in 2006 with a number of the biggest publishers in the world, we have been demonstrating in all our partnerships, like today with IDNM, SRMG’s eagerness and commitment to grow and strengthen its content platforms to be distinctly competitive in the wider space of the global media industry based on the strong professional pillars of credibility, authenticity and knowledgeable authority of quality journalism.”Both the Independent Urdu and Independent Persian are recruiting for a number of journalist positions in New York, London and Islamabad.Independent Persian is seeking reporters, copy editors, translators and also office administrators. All applicants must be fluent in Persian and English.In Islamabad Independent Urdu requires translators, reporters and copy editors.

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling was down 2\u0026nbspper cent down against the euro\u0026nbspat €1.1256.The UK currency had fallen slowly before\u0026nbspthe resignations while the FTSE 100 was broadly flat\u0026nbspas markets greeted news of the Brexit deal with caution.However, the shares of UK-focused firms were pounded as\u0026nbsppolitical uncertainty increased throughout the day.Housebuilders were especially hard hit, with Persimmon and Taylor\u0026nbspWimpey\u0026nbspdown 9 per cent and 8.6 per cent respectively.Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief economist at WorldFirst\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbspAll eyes are now on Theresa May with a challenge to her leadership increasingly being viewed as the next catalyst for another sterling collapse.Brexit deal is ‘lose-lose’ and ‘damage control’, Donald Tusk saysMr Raab announced his decision to step down on Twitter saying: “Today, I have resigned as Brexit Secretary. I cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU.”Ms\u0026nbspMcVey cited concerns over the future of the Union and the lack of control over money, law, borders and trade policy.\u0026nbspMr Raab and Ms\u0026nbspMcVey\u0027s\u0026nbspdramatic resignations will plunge Ms May\u0027s leadership into fresh crisis, and come barely\u0026nbspan hour after Northern Ireland minister\u0026nbspShailesh\u0026nbspVara\u0026nbspalso decided to quit in protest at the Brexit deal.David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, predicted that other ministers would also offer their resignations making Ms May\u0027s position increasingly tenuous.It now seems probable that a vote of no confidence will be tabled, with some reports stating that the requisite 48 letters will be sent by lunchtime, he said.Unsurprisingly there’s been a swoon in sterling with the currency lower by more than 1 per cent\u0026nbspagainst all of its major peers.So far there’s been minimal reaction seen in the stock market with the FTSE rising a little in recent trade to move up to its highest level of the day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSocial jet lag is a new phenomenon where people shift their sleeping patterns backwards and forwards during weekends and holidays. It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lloyds fell 5 per cent and Barclays 4.1 per cent.Retailers were also hit, with Marks and Spencer losing 4.7\u0026nbspper cent and Next 4 per cent.There was also pain for\u0026nbspeasyJet, which could be unable to fly planes to and from the UK in a no-deal Brexit scenario, losing 6.6\u0026nbspper cent.The Royal Mail’s shares slid\u0026nbsp6.4\u0026nbspper cent lower, taking the shares to 323p, below the 2013 float price for the first time.\u0026nbspThe overall FTSE100 index was, however, flat on the day, supported by the almost 2\u0026nbspper cent slide in sterling and the fact that many of its constituents are multinationals, earning revenues abroad in foreign currencies.The more UK-focused FTSE250 Index closed 1.31\u0026nbspper cent down.“The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders,” said Laith\u0026nbspKhalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown.\u0026nbsp“These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices.”“The sense that it might not just be the Brexit deal that is unravelling but also the government, suggests another dimension to the selling: concern that if the Conservative government falls, Labour might replace it in the event of a snap election,” said Ken\u0026nbspOdeluga\u0026nbspof City Index.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The majority said they had seen vermin in the house including rats, mice and bedbugsWomen and children seeking sanctuary in Britain are living in overcrowded houses ridden with vermin, a report has shown, almost a year after the Home Office was ordered to take urgent action over poor conditions in asylum housing.The report, seen exclusively by\u0026nbspThe Independent, reveals that asylum seeking families are being placed in accommodation so dirty it has made children ill and driven some women to self-harm.Politicians and charities said the “appalling” conditions were the result of both long delays in asylum decisions and mismanagement in the outsourcing of contracts by the Home Office allowing private firms to “cut corners”.Asylum seekers forced to make 40-mile journeys to Home Office meetingsAsylum seekers ‘could contribute £42m to UK if allowed to work’The research, by\u0026nbspthe charity Refugee Rights Europe,\u0026nbspcomes almost\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbspyears after a report by the Home Affairs Select Committee described asylum\u0026nbspaccommodation\u0026nbspas a “disgrace” and called for “urgent action” to\u0026nbspbe taken by the Home Office and providers to deal with the\u0026nbspissue.Since 2012, the Home Office has outsourced the provision of asylum accommodation to private providers Serco, Clearsprings and G4S, and despite widespread criticism of the conditions in the housing, the original five-year contracts were extended in 2017 for another two years.The research was carried out in collaboration with the\u0026nbspMEENA\u0026nbspCentre and the Baobab Women’s Project, which both support women and children asylum seekers. The report focused on the state of asylum housing in\u0026nbspBirmingham, which is run by\u0026nbspG4S. The research included a survey of 34 women, most of whom are single, orced or widowed, and many of whom have young children.Half of respondents said they found their accommodation either “dirty” or “very dirty” when\u0026nbspthey moved in. The majority said they had seen vermin in the house including rats, mice and bedbugs.Support workers told researchers that in some cases, children had developed chest infections and other illnesses as a result of the unsanitary accommodation.One Eritrean asylum seeking mother who moved into the housing when she was pregnant said: “The sofa smells. It’s very dirty and with the baby it’s not good. He has a throat problem, and the floor is so dirty. Everything is dirty.”The housing was often found to be overcrowded, with a third of respondents sharing a room with another person, while some reported staying in rooms with six, seven or even eight other people.One woman from Eritrea said: “The room they give me is very very small and has no cupboard. So small that I can not keep my things in there. I have to store them in the kitchen and the communal living room.”Many respondents said they felt unsafe in their accommodation, with nearly a third (31 per cent) of reporting having witnessed violence, and one in five experiencing violence themselves.A third of respondents said they did not feel safe raising complaints about their accommodation to their landlord or housing officers. When asked why, the majority said that they were afraid of losing their accommodation, while others said they did not want to seem “rude or ungrateful”.Peeling wallpaper could be seen in one bathroomThe report also raised\u0026nbspconcerns that many asylum seeking women were being placed far from available services and support networks and GP surgeries, leading to isolation and disruption to their children’s development.One single mother of four was forced to move four times over a short period of time, and said she had been unable to find a place in a nearby school for her 11-year-old son, who then had to travel long distances to attend school.\u0026nbspA support worker reported concerns that developmental issues in children had been missed by “postcode based” health visitors when they were moved around.Alarmingly, it appeared as though dispersal policies sometimes led to the continued separation of families and spouses. In one case, a Syrian family who had gone through a family reunification process in Britain had been placed in different cities.Half of the women interviewed reported that they had slept rough since arriving in the UK, which researchers said highlighted gaps in the accessible provision of accommodation for asylum seeking women in all stages of the process.In light of the findings, Sarah Taal, coordinator and advocate at Baobab Women’s Project, said it was “imperative” that the Home Office ensured clean and well-fixed accommodation.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May chuckles at a press conference in Downing Street after a tough day in which multiple cabinet members have resigned and a number of MPs have tabled votes of no confidence in her leadershipPro-European Union, anti-Brexit demonstrators hold placards and wave Union and EU flags as they protest outside of the Houses of Parliament.

The Home Office must ensure that iniduals seeking sanctuary in the UK are provided with humane living conditions.”Thangam Debbonaire, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on\u0026nbspRefugees, said: “The only people benefiting from this system are the private contractors providing this shoddy accommodation. These companies are being offered contracts worth £4bn over the next 10 years, and past experience shows they are not being managed properly. This allows them to cut corners and make a fortune out of desperate people.“Staffing shortages and incompetence at the Home Office mean delays to asylum decisions, forcing people to live in squalor for years.”Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the charity had seen similar issues, citing the example of pregnant women being forced to sleep on sofas in communal areas because they were unable to climb the stairs of their accommodation.He added: “And too often families and iniduals seeking asylum are housed in areas totally unsuited to their circumstances, far from the services they need to effectively navigate the process. Living on only £5.39 per day, they are unable to travel to see their solicitors.”A Home Office spokesperson said the department would be making a number of improvements to the design of the future services as a direct result of stakeholder feedback, which it said would address many of the concerns raised.The spokesperson added: “We demand the highest standards from our contractors and their accommodation. All properties are inspected by the providers on a monthly basis, in addition to regular inspections carried out by Home Office officials, to ensure that we maintain these standards.“If an inidual has concerns about their accommodation they should raise these either with their accommodation provider or directly with the Home Office. Where there is evidence that standards have fallen short, we work with providers to ensure issues are quickly addressed and when they do not we can and do impose sanctions.”John Whitwam, of\u0026nbspG4S, said:\u0026nbsp“We always take complaints about the accommodation we provide very seriously and with specific examples we can follow them up. Asylum seekers access our free 247 service centre by telephone in large numbers to report problems, in some months we receive in excess of over 4,500 calls per month.“This demonstrates a service which is working well and asylum seekers are comfortable and willing to engage, reporting issues. Any defects raised by service users are also subject to the same strict timeframe regulations as the inspections.”Asylum and ImmigrationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This would depart from the usual practice of voting on amendments to the motion before the main motion, amended or not.\u0026nbsp“The Procedure Committee recommends that, when considering the section 13 motion, the House should not depart from its usual practice of voting on amendments before voting on the main motion.”Under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, passed earlier this year, the Commons must vote to approve the draft Brexit deal and a statement on the future relationship between the UK and EU if the withdrawal agreement is to be formally ratified.MPs on the\u0026nbspProcedure Committee said there were three\u0026nbspoptions for\u0026nbspholding a “meaningful vote” on the deal.The first would see the Commons follow its\u0026nbspusual practice of voting on amendments\u0026nbspbefore voting on the motion itself. However, the process\u0026nbspwould be adapted to allow for a much lengthier debate than the usual 90 minutes and to ensure that more than the usual one amendment is voted on.The second option would involve voting on the substance of the motion and then deciding on possible amendments. This was rejected by the committee.A third possibility would see MPs vote on a series of non-binding motions expressing varying views, before holding the binding vote on the main motion.Charles Walker, chair of the Procedure Committee, said:\u0026nbsp“The decision that MPs will be required to make on any motion to approve a withdrawal agreement will be one of the most momentous decisions ever taken both for the House of Commons and for the country.“However it is clear that there are ergent views on how the procedure should operate. Today’s report sets out three potential models for MPs to consider, with a recommendation that the House should not depart from its usual practice of voting on amendments before voting on the main motion.”\u0026nbspUltimately the Commons itself will decide what form the votes take. The government will table its proposal in the form of a business motion and put it to a vote of MPs.Live: Theresa May vows to fight on as ministers desert herPolice left with ‘no idea’ how to protect British public after Brexit What is the Brexit deal?

Conservative remain backers - around 8 MPs - have also spoken out against the deal.\u0026nbspThe PM could be forced to find up to 100 MPs from elsewhere, though that number may be whittled down by the whips.But the SNP and the Liberal Democrats are pro-Europe, and Labour is due to vote against it, so she may struggle to make up the numbers.3 What does the Brexit deal mean for UK citizens living in Europe?Protecting citizens rights has been a key issue as more than\u0026nbsp3 million EU citizens live in the UK and 1 million UK nationals reside in European countries.The agreement safeguards the existing rights of UK citizens who were living in the EU up to the end of the transition period\u0026nbspand vice versa. Family members will be able to join them, as under current rules. Children born after Brexit will also be covered.However it does not clear up questions over\u0026nbsponward movement for Britons\u0026nbspwho might want to move to another EU country from the one they are living in after Brexit.It also doesn\u0027t cover what happens to people who want to\u0026nbspwork in different countries, which is one of the main concerns for British nationals living in the EU.\u0026nbsp4 What does the Brexit deal mean for the Irish border?The Irish border has been the most difficult issue to square for negotiators.Ms May has promised to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic amid fears it could herald a return to violence and threaten the peace process.The agreement includes a backstop, which would keep the whole of the UK within a customs union with the EU to prevent the need for a endless checks at the border.The backstop is a type of safety net. It comes into force after the end of the transition period and will stay in place until Brussels and London come up with a better plan.Northern Ireland would also stay aligned to parts of the EU\u0027s single market, so goods coming in would need to be checked to see if they meet EU rules. Goods going in the other direction would not have the same checks.None of this is popular with Brexiteers or the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), as they fear it keeps the UK too closely tied to Brussels.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So we will continue to argue as hard as we can for that sensible option.”The Scottish National Party leader spoke about her “profound concern” that making special provisions for Northern Ireland as part of the Brexit plan would give that country “unfettered access” to the European market, leaving Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.She told the audience: “I as First Minister spend a lot of time talking to companies that are considering investing in Scotland, employing people in Scotland, expanding existing operations, and we do really well at attracting companies to come and invest here, we’re the best performing part of the UK outside of London for attracting inwards investment.Created with Sketch.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The 585-page document was signed off by the Cabinet after five hours of heated discussions but it has inflamed Tory backbenchers who say there is little to show for the \u0026pound39 billion orce bill the country will have to pay.

If either side fails to do so, this could be referred to an independent arbitration panel.The backstop includes a mechanism which either the UK or the EU can trigger to review the arrangements, which could ultimately lead to the backstop ceasing to apply.

Or do you think the Prime Minister has broken promises and ultimately left the UK at the mercy of Brussels? The under-pressure Prime Minister cleared the first hurdle when Cabinet ministers finally approved the draft terms of her agreement with Brussels after a marathon five-hour meeting, which stretched on far beyond its expected time. Reports suggested as many as a third of the 28 ministers attending voiced doubts about the draft agreement drawn up by UK and EU negotiators after 19 months of talks in Brussels.

We do not agree on all those choices, but I respect their views.It comes after the Prime Minister stood on the steps of Downing Street last night and warned MPs that if they failed to back it in Parliament, the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal or not leave at all.Offering the nation an ultimatum,\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspsaid: \u0026ldquoThe choice before us is clear - this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Dominic Raab has resigned over May\u0027s Brexit deal  (Image:  )Following the release of the 585-page agreement document, prominent Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg - the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) - wrote to all Tory MPs urging them to vote against it.The ERG, led by Mr Rees-Mogg, claims it has 80 MPs ready to vote against what it sees as Mrs May\u0027s capitulation to Brussels.Mr Rees-Mogg yesterday directly raised the spectre of a leadership challenge to Mrs May during a Commons debate.The leading Brexiteer highlighted areas of the deal where he said the honourable Prime Minister had reneged on promises over leaving the customs union, maintaining the internal integrity of the UK and leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.He told MPs: As what my right honourable friend says and what my right honourable friend does no longer match, should I not write to my right honourable friend the member for Altrincham and Sale West?This was a reference to Sir Graham Brady MP, the chairman of the Tory 1922 committee, to whom MPs must write to express no confidence in a leader in order to trigger a challenge.Meanwhile, rumours have continued to swirl at Westminster that the tally of Conservative MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May is about to reach the 48 threshold needed to trigger a vote on her position.Sources said the delivery of letters to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady was imminent, with a total of 48 needed to trigger a vote on the Tory leader\u0026rsquos position.Brexit news: EU leaders will agree the Brexit plan on the 25 November  (Image:  )Speaking outside 10 Downing Street minutes after the crunch Cabinet meeting concluded, Mrs May acknowledged she faced difficult days ahead as she prepares to seek the backing of the House of Commons in what is expected to be the toughest vote of her parliamentary career.\u0026nbspShe said: I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.But with Mrs May\u0026rsquos Cabinet giving the green light to Britain\u0027s Brexit blueprint, it clears the way for the special Brexit summit in Brussels for EU leaders to approve the deal later this month.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker issued a statement that decisive progress had been made, clearing the way for a special summit for leaders of the remaining 27 EU states to rubber stamp plans.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Theresa May faces the fiercest battle of her political career (Image: EPA )The European Council will hold an extraordinary summit in Brussels on November 25 to finalise the UK\u0027s withdrawal agreement, council president Donald Tusk confirmed.This is when leaders of the remaining 27 EU states will be asked to put their stamp on the document and the agreement will then be sent for ratification to both the Westminster Parliament and the European Parliament.The British Government would hope to stage a vote in the House of Commons before Christmas, and if every obstacle is cleared, the deal would come into effect in time for the UK\u0027s departure on March 29 2019.It is expected the debate will stretch over several days and will end in a meaningful vote, possibly in early December, before the next scheduled European Council summit on December 13.

A senior Downing Street aide overseeing Brexit legislation also quit. Mrs May was braced for a battle to hold onto her leadership after Jacob Rees-Mogg led backbench Eurosceptics in demanding an immediate no-confidence vote among Tory MPs. But in a defiant salvo at her party foes, the Prime Minister insisted she would fight any attempt to force her out and would not be deflected from her Brexit plan.

Yes.In response to a question about whether she would resign as captain, cricket-loving Mrs May told said: One of my cricket heroes was always Geoffrey Boycott.And what do you know about Geoffrey Boycott? Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end.Mrs May\u0027s authority was on the line in the aftermath of her attempt to force her Cabinet to back the deal agreed between UK and EU negotiators early this week.Mr Raab quit early yesterday after failing to persuade the Prime Minister to dump her deal and return to Brussels with a final offer.He was soon followed out of the Cabinet by Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and a string of other frontbenchers.Mrs May then found her deal under attack from MPs across the Commons during a gruelling three-hour question and answer session.In one withering intervention, Mr Rees-Mogg accused her of misleading MPs about how closely the UK will be tied to Brussels through her deal and threatened to formally demand a vote of no-confidence in her leadership.Brexit news: Theresa May may face more resignations and political pressure tomorrow (Image: )The backbencher, chairman of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tories, then held a meeting with colleagues before heading to the St Stephen\u0027s Entrance to Parliament to announce that he had written to party chiefs to demand the ballot.This is not Brexit. It is a failure of Government policy. It needs to be rejected, Mr Rees-Mogg said.He goaded the Prime Minister by naming leading Tory Brexit supporters including Boris Johnson, David Davis, Mr Raab, Ms McVey and Penny Mordaunt as potential successors in Downing Street to deliver a clear break with the EU.Mr Rees-Mogg predicted the 48-plus letters from Tory backbenchers needed to trigger a confidence vote would be delivered after a string of members of his European Research Group pledged to follow his lead.Backing the move, former Brexit minister Steve Baker said: We\u0027ve tried everythng to change policy but not the Prime Minister but it has not worked. We need a new leader.Andrea Jenkyns, another former frontbencher, said: From what MPs are telling me, more letters have gone in. I have even had current ministers tell me that in a vote of no confidence they would vote Theresa May out.She can fight it, but I am confident she will not win it.Ms Jenkyns claimed it was time to save Brexit and our party with a new leader.Brexit news: Theresa May issued a rallying cry in Downing Street today (Image: )Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee and custodian of the letter demanding a confidence vote, was understood to have held a meeting with Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith yesterday but did not publicly speak about a possible ballot.Allies of the Prime Minister were appalled at the open disloyalty yesterday.The Chief Whip said the Prime Minister would not abandon the withdrawal agreement in the face of widespread opposition among MPs.Leaving Downing Street, he told reporters: The Prime Minister is moving things on in the best interests of the country.The Prime Minister will not be bullied and will not change course.Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan said Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s intervention was deeply destructive for the Government and for the Conservative Party.If this Government is undermined further, we could destroy the Government, we could significantly damage and even destroy the Conservative Party, he told the BBC.This could lead us to being almost ungovernable for a bit.Senior backbencher Sir Nicholas Soames, another loyalist, said: It should be a point of Honour to see off the European Research Group and it\u0026rsquos hard-Right members who have been ruining the fortunes of our party for years.Mrs May launched her bid to sell her deal to Parliament and the country with a Commons statement yesterday morning.She found her Brexit deal attacked both Leave and Remain-backing MPs on both sides of the House.Mrs May rebuffed a string of attacks on her deal from all sides of the Commons during three hours of questioning.Brexit news: Campaigners outside Westminster today as Theresa May clung to power (Image: )Rejecting accusations from Labour that she had bowed to pressure from Tory Brexiteers, the Prime Minister said: I have kowtowed to no one. The instruction I take is the instruction that was given to every Member of this House by the British people in the referendum in 2016.Mrs May also rebuffed an invitation from Labour to confirm whether she thought the UK will be better off under her Brexit deal compared with being a member of the EU.Labour MP asked her to say hand on heart, whether she believes that what she has negotiated is better than the deal we have now.The Prime Minister replied: I firmly believe that this country\u0026rsquos best days are ahead of us.We will get a good deal with the European Union and take advantage of our independence outside the EU with our trade deals around the rest of the world.In a hushed chamber, Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs that while the Prime Minister was unquestionably honourable her deeds had failed to match her words.He said the deal failed to deliver her promises of pulling the country out of the EU\u0027s customs union, protecting the integrity of the UK and ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.In a reference to Sir Graham Brady, he added: As what my right honourable friend says, and what my right honourable friend does, no longer match, should I not write to my honourable friend the member for Altrincham and Sale West?In an intervention that made Mrs May wince, former minister Mark Francois told her that she had done her best but more than 80 Tories were ready to line up with opposition parties to vote down her deal.It is therefore mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons, he warned.The stark reality, Prime Minister, is that it was dead on arrival at St Tommy\u0026rsquos before you stood up, so I plead with you to accept the political reality of the situation you now face, he added.Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Nigel Dodds signalled that the 10 MPs from his Northern Ireland party could end their parliamentary alliance that props up Mrs May\u0027s minority Tory government.I could stand here today and take the Prime Minister through the list of promises and pledges that she made to this House, and to us privately, about the future of Northern Ireland in the future relationship with the EU, but I fear it would be a waste of time, since she clearly does not listen, he told her.He accused her of pledging to pay a \u0026pound39billion orce bill to Brussels for nothing and praised resigning Tory ministers for their strong actions.Mr Dodds added: The choice is now clear: we stand up for the United Kingdom\u0026mdashthe whole United Kingdom and the integrity of the United Kingdom\u0026mdashor we vote for a vassal state, with the break-up of the United Kingdom. That is the choice.Andrew Bridgen, one of Mrs May\u0027s most outspoken Tory critics, told her: The Prime Minister is well known for her dancing - sadly having seen the withdrawal agreement it\u0027s now clear whose tune she\u0027s been dancing to.He pointed out she had campaigned for Remain, she voted Remain, now surely it\u0027s in the national interest for her to leave - perhaps following a short transition period.It took 57 minutes of the Commons session for any MP to voice support for the Prime Minister and her draft deal.Sir Peter Bottomley told her he backed her in trying to get the sovereignty she has argued for, and the prospects of prosperity, security and a fruitful partnership across the channel, the North sea and across the world.He added: The alternatives, if we do not go through with this, are the probability of crashing out and the possibility of a Government led by the Leader of the Opposition, neither of which is a desirable alternative.Speculation that International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, another Eurosceptic minister, could follow Mr Raab and Ms McVey out of the Cabinet subsided last night after she held met Mrs May in Downing Street and was seen leaving by ministerial car.

including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby. Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired in , costing the party its Commons majority.Critics in her own party are circling over her handling of Brexit while a number of cabinet ministers resigned on November , , over her soft orce deal with the EU.She could be forced out MPs demand her exit and she loses a subsequent vote.There would then be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to her government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.There could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000240614813.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg children vandalised house brexit","story":"The MP for North East Somerset caused controversy after airing his views on abortion and gay marriage. Then, on August  his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He has batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October  he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August , , when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea. Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003730276661-e1541888658682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp lives in social housing","story":"Shadow development secretary Kate Osamor has faced intense criticism after it emerged that she promoted her son in his House of Commons job, regardless of his conviction for having £, of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bestival in Dorset last year.Now the Sun on Sunday can reveal that Ms Osamor and her son Ishmael, , are living in social housing in Tottenham, north London -

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What I can tell you is there’s no orchestrated attempt to put letters in.He continued: But sensing the levels of frustration and annoyance colleagues are feeling it would not surprise meorganically letters are going in.The ERG has responded with fury to early reports of Mrs Mays Brexit deal.They claim it will leave the UK tied to the EU permanently thanks to the controversial Irish backstop meant to keep the border open.If Sir Graham, chair of the  Committee, receives  letters asking for a confidence vote, he must hold one within days.Mrs May will be kicked out of powershe fails to win the backing of  of the Tories  MPs.Butshe survives, the party cant hold another vote of confidence for at least a year.Another way Mrs May could be forced out is through a motion of no confidence in the entire government.A ’no confidence’ vote is a formal motion in the House of Commons with the wording: “That this house has no confidence in HM Government.”If there is a vote of no confidence, there will be a two-week ‘cooling off’ period in which time Mrs May will still remain in Downing Street.She will then try and talks to form a new government, butno government can be formed, the prime minister will be forced to call a date for a general election.Of course Mrs May could decide at any time she simply doesnt want to be Prime Minister any more.That will automatically trigger a leadership contest, where Tories will bid to become the next leader and PM.MPs will whittle down the challengers to just  - and those will then be handed over to the Tory membership who will vote and become the next PM.If all of them drop out - like in the summer of  where Mrs May became PM - whoever is left will become leader of the country automatically.They will then go to the Queen and ask permission to form a new government.Mrs May could also be forced out by way of a General election.If two thirds of MPs voted in the House of Commons for a fresh vote, then Parliament would be dissolved and the public would be asked to go to the ballot box yet again.In the event that Labour won more seats than the Tories, Mrs May would automatically be booted from No.If the Tories won the most seats then its likely she would try and form another government - whether on her own or in coalition with another party.Anything is possible in politics right now - even another referendum.If Mrs May decided to call a vote on her deal or No Deal at all, voters could be asked which they would prefer in another Brexit vote.In the event that the Government lost that, Mrs May would almost certainly have to leave office, as David Cameron did in .Today Mrs Mays job hangs by a thread after four ministers including Dominic Raab quit in protest at her deal.She told MPs in the Commons today that her deal was the best on offer, and she believed it was the best thing for the country.But furious MPs are still sending in letters of no confidence in her - and she could be toppled within hours."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000448294295.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu army terrible mistake","story":"But there’s something rather wonderful about Donald Trump’s ability to speak the truth, with no frills attached.And not care who he p***es off. It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter. We were snowed in for a week. Nobody could come to visit.The missus couldn’t get to the shops to buy anything.It was just about perfect. All you need is a few bottles of Jack Daniel’s and some soup. Make sure you’re prepared.LUCKY, lucky earthquake victims.Here’s Paris Hilton in Mexico, visiting survivors of the  earthquake.And giving them bottles of Paris Hilton perfume and cushions with “Paris Hilton” stamped across them.Just exactly what they needed.Paris said: “I love the people, I think they are all beautul, they have great hearts, they are beautul inside and out, they are very genuine and incredible.”Just like you, Paris, just like you. A WOMAN who met the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester says she was offered an interesting proposition.Have sex with me, the -year-old goat suggested, and I’ll make you a baroness.Can’t say fairer than that, can you The most I’ve ever offered is a bag of Pickled Onion Monster Munch.Lester has been suspended from the House of Lords as a result.Thing is, it’s always the liberals who get up to this kind of stuff.Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and now Lester.Ladies, I’m telling you,a liberal bloke approaches you in a bar telling you how pro-feminist he is, activate your alarm, call the Old Bill and get the hell out, sharpish.THIS is Sophie Michelle. She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off. Threatening to kill anyone who supports her.We should give the poor woman asylum in our country, away from the Islamist savages in Pakistan.But the Government fears “reprisal” attacks by the extremists.That’s a gutless response and devoid of ­principle.Give Asia Bibi a home here. We’ll deal with the savagesthey try ­anything on.We’re getting used to it, after all.I’M trying to work out which of the Remoaners I dislike more. Gary Lineker or Tony Blair.I suppose Gary didn’t illegally invade a sovereign country.But then Blair never sported a stupid goatee beard or spent half of his le selling crisps.Although I daresay he would have donethere’d been enough dosh in it.Lineker, like many other remoaners, was demanding a second vote on Brexit.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot. You surely know it.Do not kid yourself no one is paying attention. The public has been sold a pup again and again. It has had enough.Come clean with Britain. This deal is not wholly without merit.

a table of commonly used slang words and their meanings.When their colleague shared a photo of the table to Reddit, hilarious comments began flooding in.Discussions about whether the slang was accurate, when it came about and from what regions ensued.And there were plenty of linguistic puns in between.The debate kicked off by questioninganyone in the UK besides Jamie Oliver actually uses the word pukka.When one Reddit user questions the use of the word, Daedeluss is quick to mention its a term readily used in Jamie Olivers cookery shows.The conversation then descends into calling the chef insufferable and attacking his infamous lisp.Hytyt even says its used as an insult for people who spit in the kitchen he works at as people say: Alright Jamie, dont soak the food.Next up in the animated debate was those who thought the list was wrong - as the slang wasnt from the UK.Many Reddit users seemed to think the slang terms like crikey and shotgun were better suited to our Australian and American counterparts.They then went on to discuss the usage of the term shotgun, as its used dferently throughout the UK.After some commenters had expressed that they wanted to have a copy of this table for reference, someone kindly uploaded a printable version for other foreign expats to make use of.This proved useful for many who said they always struggled when going to meet their British partners families.While some discussed the origins of the words on the table, some useful commenters decided to contribute their own slang.Apparently the word peng has been around for seven or eight years according to Jimofwales on Reddit, but others arent so sure they understand its meaning.As the original post by u althorno was about a French colleague, sll decided to make this absolute corker of a joke about Monet.It read: Monitarily  Surprised a Francophone cant spell monet - in reference to the French artist and the incorrect spelling of monetarily.Continuing with the theme of French language jokes, this person innocently asked what the French slang was for up the duff - as in pregnant.But the reply was simply: Ruine ta vie - meaning ruin your le.The next joker decided to take a hit at the tumultuous time of British and US politics - comparing both countries to sinking ships.It read: If the UK and the US are both ships. The UK is a ship with a hole in it. The US is missing half the ship and it is on fire. There is an orange captain of the ship saying, It is fine, it is a lie that you cant sail with half a ship.A sad but hilarious conclusion to the responses on Reddit.The table used to translate British slang is similar to that used by Surrey Police to help officers understand teenage slang.They learnt phrases like peng and wagwarn.When it was shared on Facebook some parents even commented that they found it useful too."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fish7.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"freaky creature turns its face inside out like something from a ridley scott alien film","story":"Looking like something out of a Ridley Scotts Alien film, it writhes in a gloved hand and appears to be grinning.Fisherman Roman Fedortsov, who caught and filmed the freaky fish, made a scary sound as he said: If this creature could scream, I think it would scream like this.”The trawlerman, from the city of Murmansk in north-western Russia’s Arkhangelsk Oblast region, posted the clip on Instagram.

Their departures were followed by five lower-ranking aides.And on a day of high drama:An hour after Mr Raab and Ms McVey announced their exits, Mrs May made a statement in the Commons where she was mauled by MPs on all sides.Mr Rees-Mogg declared war by announcing he had written to the powerful Tory  committee demanding a no-confidence vote.Mr Gove then seemingly turned down the chance to take over as Brexit Secretary with sources saying he would take it onlyhe could renegotiate the current withdrawal deal.But the PM defiantly pledged to carry on in the national interest eventhe compromises involved were not comfortable.She said: “The choice is clear. We can choose to leave with no deal.“We can have no Brexit at all. Or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated.“I choose to deliver for the British people. I choose to do what is in the national interest.”The chaos sent the Pound plunging as markets took fright at the chances of a Brexit deal receding.Rocked by Jacob Rees-Mogg’s bid to replace her with a prominent Leave campaigner, the PM vowed to cling to power even when Tory MPs do manage to trigger a confidence vote in her as party leader.A threshold of  letters demanding one could be reached as early as Friday, with the pivotal vote of all  Tory MPs expected on Monday or Tuesday next week.Even impartial Tories predicted the result could be very tight, with as many as  to  MPs voting against Mrs May or abstaining - making it nigh on impossible for her to carry on.But the PM  signalled last night that she will stay on evenshe wins the vote by a margin of just ONE.When asked that by The Sun, she insisted: “Am I going to see this through  Yes.“Leadership is about taking the right decisions, not the easy ones.”Meanwhile the depth of the crisis that has gripped the Tories became clear when it emerged grandees fear the party will now split apart.The Sun can reveal that emergency planning has already begun for le after Mrs May.Some ministers have initiated  secret talks with moderate Labour MPs for a ‘Government of National Unity’ behind No’s backs as the only hope of ending the Brexit deadlock in the Commons.One mid-ranking minister involved in the clandestine talks told The Sun: “We are speaking to sensible Labour people to see what might be possible.“It’s early days, but we may well end up needing to govern with them when Theresa goes. It really is that bad in my view.”Friends say Mr Davis is ready to take on the jobit comes this side of Christmas.The PM said she was “sorry” so many ministers had decided to go, and admitted some decisions she has had to take to strike an agreement with Brussels were “dficult and sometimes uncomfortable”.But she remained unrepentant about her controversial Brexit deal, which Brexiteers argue leaves Britain tied to EU rules for years after we leave.Mrs May insisted: “I believe with every fibre of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country”.But she also issued a thinly veiled warning that funding for schools and hospitals could be slashedMPs reject her deal and the UK spins out without one, saying the UK then faces “a path of deep and grave uncertainty”.The crisis was sparked when Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab revealed he had resigned at .am yesterday – the second Brexit Secretary to go on five months.Furious at the level of dictation that the UK will be forced to take from Brussels under the plan, Mr Raab told The Sun: “I don’t want to submit to the blackmail of my country”.There were also three resignations in the lower ranks, with Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Ranil Jayawardena quitting as PPSs at the Department of Education and the Ministry of Justice, and Rehman Christi quit as a Tory vice chair.Then at pm, hardline Brexiteer leader Mr Rees-Mogg struck, revealing he had handed in his letter of no-confidence in Mrs May to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee.A series of other members of the European Research Group faction that he chairs are followed suit, as Mr Rees-Mogg declared: “What we need is a leader who will stand up to the European Union”.But he argued: “Coup is the wrong word. This is entirely constitutional, by the rules of the Conservative Party”.He said he himself would not stand to replace her, but named four potential candidates – Boris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab, and Penny Mordaunt.ERG bosses told The Sun they are unsure they have the numbers to succeed, but still believe a powerful show of force from Brexiteers will sink Mrs May.The PM’s refusal to dump her Brexit deal during tense exchanges in the Commons pushed the MPs over the edge, they said.During an electric three hour-long grilling of Mrs May, ERG vice chair Mark Francois told the PM her deal was “deal on arrival in St Tommys” and pleaded with her “to accept the political reality you face”.Mr Francois claimed  Tory MPs will now vote against her deal, as well as Labour, the DUP, the Lib Dems and the SNP, adding: “It is mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons”.In another bitter attack on her, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told the PM her deal is “a vote for a vassal state to break up the United Kingdom”, and said there was no point in saying more, as “she doesn’t listen”.The Brexiteers’ leadership challenge sparked bitter recriminations from Tory loyalists, and exploded a full-blown civil war in the party.Chief Whip Julian Smith hit back to say Mrs May “will not be bullied”.Foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan raged: “This is foolhardy, self-indulgent, and wrecking. What’s their alternative “They risk bringing down the Government, destroying the party’s prospects and quite possibly breaking it altogether”Scottish Secretary David Mundell branded Mr Raab “a carpetbagger”, adding of him: “I’m sure this is more about manoeuvring and leadership.Prisons minister Rory Stewart attacked Mr Rees-Mogg and the ERG as “pompous people producing medieval fantasies”.And senior backbencher Bob O’Neill added: “It’s total self-indulgence by my colleagues, they should be ashamed of themselves”.Another senior Tory minister added: “I am now extremely worried about the start of our party. It is being stretched to widely and it is going to break.”Mrs May was Thursday night struggling to replace Mr Raab as his job as well as Ms McVey’s went unfilled overnight.She will be forced to carry out a signicant reshuffle on Friday.Explaining the failing, the PM said: “I have had rather a busy day”.Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Ms Mordaunt both held tough conversations with Mrs May yesterday over their futures, and No aides fear they too could also still resign.The Development Secretary again asked the PM to give all Tory MPs a free vote on her deal when it reaches the Commons.Friends say the PM is considering her request overnight.He has to noty Downing Street within  hours of receiving the th letter.He would call a simple yes no ballot of all  Conservative MPs asking whether the leader should stay.The Sun knew of at least  letters of no confidence from Tories with more expected today.A ballot could be held on Mondaythe  figure is reached by then.

One attendee said: “I’m really shocked, something changed very late. Dom genuinely appeared to believe people would be relieved when they saw the detail. Then bam, two days later he’s gone.”Later on Tuesday Mr Raab was sent a draft of the Withdrawal Agreement and was left stunned that things he had warned must be included to get the deal through Parliament had been haggled away.Mr Raab had pushed hard for a “unilateral” way of Britain walking away from controversial Irish “backstop”, but instead he found the insurance option that would keep Britain tied to Brussels customs rules for years to come as the basis of a future trade deal, rather than a last resort.And he had seen key parts of the draft future trade deal plan that left the door open to a looser Canada-style deal stripped out in behind closed doors talks with Brussels that he was cut out from.In the final version of the text, all of the things he warned were needed to sell the deal to Brexiteers were gone.When Mrs May’s  strong top team finally got around the table at pm on Wednesday, Mr Raab surprised colleagues – by hardly saying a word.The Prime Minister went around the table, with Mr Raab speaking first, to gauge opinion of dferent Ministers - with  speaking criticising the exit terms.Some thought he was being “weasley” but secretly he had already made his mind up.He was not the only one around the table seething in anger - and his silence was in stark contrast to the anger of Esther McVey.The Work and Pensions Secretary stunned Cabinet colleagues by ripping into the Prime Minister over the “sell-out” and demanded everyone have a vote to register the scale of the rebellion in official minutes. It was swtly denied by the PM’s Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill.Pals said Ms McVey had realised she had probably gone too far and decided straight after the showdown that she’d have to go – given relations with No. were already at an all-time low over Universal Credit before the Budget.One ally told The Sun: “She wrote the letter after Cabinet and then fired it off this morning.” They added it was “rubbish” that she was reduced to tears.“Anyone who knows Esther knows that’s cobblers,” the source said. Another cabinet source added: “In a way Esther spoke for us all. We all felt appalling treated and she did not pull her punches.”The first signs of trouble emerged publicly on Wednesday evening after the PM admitted her five hour Cabinet session had been “impassioned”.But behind the black door Mr Raab had taken the Chief Whip aside to tell him he could not tolerate what he was being asked to sign up for.In a bid to calm tensions No had “kettled” Ministers inside No with a glass of “cheap red wine” while the PM addressed the nation - but their bid to sooth tempers failed.By dawn on Thursday it was clear he would not be the only going - his walk out sparking a wave of junior Ministerial departures and finally tipping the Tory right to declare it was time for a new PM.All the resignations followed the same structure, a tweet with a photograph of their letter explaining their reasons. With rolling exits every  minutes throughout the morning, Downing Street insiders began to fear an orchestrated plot.Tory whips were despatched around the sprawling parliamentary estate to sound out whether wavering MPs would back the PM in a looming confidence vote.As the flurry of resignations began to ease, Theresa May’s next headache began.Jacob Rees Mogg gathered  members of the hardline European Research Group bloc of Brexiteers to the grand wood led Committee Room of the House of Commons.After keeping their powder dry for months, the ERG were finally ready to push the button.Ever since the Tories election disaster last June, the group led by Mr Rees Mogg had urged hotheads to bide their time - but now he ruled Mrs May’s time was up.At one point the growing throng of reporters gathered outside was so large the House of Commons doorkeepers had to get police officers to marshal the crowd.Emerging from the room to declare it he was calling for a No Confidence vote, Mr Rees Mogg quipped. were getting into a bit of a bottleneck, like the negotiations.Marching through parliament, with two dozen reporters and TV cameras mobbing him, he insisted he had not launched “a coup” but insisted I am not offering my name as leader.” And the media circus continued outside the grand St Stephens entrance to the House of Commons - the very spot that Theresa May launched her bid to be PM in July .Mr Rees Mogg told the crowd: This is nothing to do with the ambition of Brexiteers. It is everything to do with the ambition of Brexit for this country. But it was clear the hardliners have decided time was up for the PM andthey cannot defeat her, at least they can show Downing Street the have the numbers to defeat her hated Brussels deal.The ERG know that they would only have one shot at taking out the PM and today the name on their lips as a replacement was Dominic Raab.One Brexiteer said: “He’s standing has risen dramatically,these letters go in I wouldn’t put it past us to pick him unanimously as our would-be leader.” And his predecessor in the Brexit Secretary role David Davis told The Sun: “He’s done the right thing.“This deal does not meet either the expectations of the referendum or the promises of the manesto.“No Brexit secretary can stay in place in the face of that. And I should know.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Britain should be able to make its own FTA with America, opening that largest of all national markets to free access for British companies.And a free trade agreement with the US would also allow the UK to import American goods at the best available prices.The same applies to China. If Australia can negotiate a free trade agreement with China which gives  per cent of Australian exports to China tarf and quota-free access, then Britain can do the same.Countries such as Japan and Australia are also keen to make free trade agreements with the UK.More than that, both those countries have said they would be delighted to have the UK in the great Asia-Pacic trade arrangement, known as the Trans-Pacic Partnership.That includes  countries from Canada to Australia to Mexico to Singapore.So when you stop to think about it, there is a wealth of opportunities Britain could seize outside the EU, whereasthe UK were to stay in the EU, the EU would negotiate trade agreements on Britain’s behalf.Those agreements,they could be concluded at all, wouldn’t be designed just for the UK they would have to suit all the other  countries of the EU, and we know their interests are often very dferent from Britain’s.The EU sees Brexit as a threat.It fears a liberated Britain would steal a competitive advantage over the EU and that investment, as well as trade, would flow more to Britain’s shores than the EU’s.That, ultimately, is why the EU wants to keep Britain in the customs union.If it does, then Brexit will be no threat the EU will make trade policy for the UK and it will also write Britain’s regulatory requirements.The danger of Theresa May’s agreement with the EU is that it runs the risk of locking Britain into the EU regulatory arrangements and denying Britain the opportunity to negotiate trade agreements.In other words, the UK would gain almost nothing from leaving the EU.On the contrary, it would lose one important thing — the right to have a say over regulations and trade policy.So that’s what all the fuss is about.It would be better to crash out of the EU than be locked indefinitely in the single market and the customs union.Indeed, it would be better to stay in the EU and participate in decision-making than leave but let the EU decide the destiny of British regulations and trade policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It may be turgid but the draft Brexit deal is vitally important - and itll decidethe Prime Minister is toppled. The agreement is set to be signed off in an EU summit on November . But it could have a huge impact on Northern Ireland businesses and keep the UK locked in the orbit of Brusselsthings go wrong. MPs from hard Tory Brexiteers to Labour have demanded it is voted down when it comes to a crunch decision in Parliament, due within a month. And theyre calling no confidence in the PM. That would throw Brexit back to square one and is likely to remove the flailing Prime Minister from office. So what is in the Brexit deal and why are people so het up about it  Weve taken a closer look.  Weve signed up to a transition period that will continue pretty much all EU rules until December . Now this could be extended - and crucially, we dont yet know how long for. The deal only covers to the year xx. Which to put it mildly is a bit vague. Senior officials insist that by the time MPs have a vote, therell be a maximumof extra transition - which would then be whittled down further. But its likely to prompt a huge row. The transition period can only be extended once. And it would be done by the UK making a request before  June . This request would be considered by an arbitration . That  would have  UK members,  EU members and  independent member, chosen through a legal process. We dont know who theyd be. Eventhe transition period is extended we could still end up in a backstop. For more on that, read on...  Under the backstop - a backup plantheres no agreement for the Northern Ireland border - there COULD be checks on some goods between Northern Ireland and the UK. Theresa Mays DUP allies say this is unacceptable and its likely to prompt a huge row. Northern Ireland firms will access the EU Single Market as a whole without restriction. This will mean Northern Ireland will have to apply EU law on industrial, environmental and agricultural goods. That means some of these goods would need checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  The backstop -it kicks in on  January  - will extend EU customs rules across the whole of the UK. This makes Brexiteers furious because it will stop us signing trade deals with the rest of the world - and lock us into Brussels rules without any say on them. Whats worse, we can only quit the backstopthere is mutual agreement between the UK and the EU. Senior UK officials insisted the EU would have to act in good faith. But thatll be cold comfort to Tory Brexiteers. European courts will still have a big hold on the UK  Any judgements from the European Court of Justice handed down during the transition period will be binding on the UK. And the arbitration  that resolves disputeswill not intervene in cases involving EU law. Instead the European Court of Justice will rule on those questions. And we still have a long way to go...  Senior UK officials tonight admitted there is still a lot of negotiation to go. The UK has now unlocked negotiations on the so-called future framework for a deal that can lead to trade after Brexit. They are trying to get parts of that closed off before MPs have their meaningful vote in Parliament. So sit tight - theres a very long way still left to run.

A few days ago, a picture of one of its streets – Austin Avenue – was used on an attack advert by the Republican party in the United States. “They’ve no right,” Doris Telford, , a retired advocate for elderly people says. “They’ve never even been here.” Scott Michael, , nods. “We’re fed up of people saying we’re a shanty town,” he says. “We’re a community.”  A tenant of one of the houses in the picture asks not to be identied. “I didn’t have a choice about moving here,” she says. “The council moved me out of London because of the benefit cap. It’s a good enough place but the houses are falling down.” Built when motoring was in its infancy, Jaywick’s streets are named after cars, and the street plan was designed to look like a car grille.In the s, newly mobile families were able to get to the seaside at weekends, and a shyproperty developer had the idea of selling them land to build chalets on. During the postwar housing crisis people started moving to Jaywick permanently. Now, decades on, many of theseoriginally shytemporary homes are desperately patched up, or in dereliction, but local spirit remains strong.Even the village’s one pub is called the Never Say Die.  Today, at the Community Centre, built on what was once the boating lake, most of Jaywick has squeezed in to see Mr Alston, the man from the UN, and to hear searing testimonies organised by Unite Community. One man, called Steve, tells Alston he and his we had both been made redundant by the job centre. “The debts just kept racking up,” he says. “We were relying on foodbanks.We could just about afford to feed the kids, but we were missing meals. I felt I needed to provide, as a man, and I couldn’t do it. I didn’t realise how bad it had affected me. “In January , I contemplated taking my own le. I thought no one will miss me, I’m useless. I’m just going to end it.” When he tried to get help he was told he could only have telephone counselling. Another speaker, Trisha, tried to take her own le after getting pound, into debt.She’d worked her whole le for the NHS but left with spinal problems. Help from Christians Against Poverty made her realise “I’ve got a lot to live for and a lot to offer”. But she adds: “Now, my area has gone to Universal Credit and I’m struggling again. All the clothes I’ve got on now are from the British Heart Foundation. I was six weeks with no money coming in, living off baked beans.” She finishes sadly: “It’s a lonely world out there.” Wheelchair-user Erin’s family went from “a comfortable middle-class two-income household” to near destitution after she had a brain haemorrhage. The family have found themselves excluded from the rental market because of insidious ‘no DSS’ rules.  “So I am to be made homeless,” Erin says. “I don’t where I am going to be putting our -year-old child to bed. This is the hostility faced by disabled people under austerity. We’ve even lost the very human right of a home.” Alston is clearly moved by what he’s heard, and he reassures people their testimonies “are not going to be for nothing”. At the end of the meeting, in carefully chosen words, he echoes one of the final speakers. “Mike says that ‘Austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity’. That’s right. Poverty is a choice. You can choose not to make people poor.”  Outside, night has fallen, and opposite the Community Centre the boarded-up Mermaid Inn and the derelict Dolphin Diner are a reminder of what Jaywick once was and could be again, given a fair chance. Today, the world will hear from Alston. How bitterly ironic that while he’s been here one of the politicians most responsible for these stories – Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions – has resigned.Not from shame, but because she now hopes to become Prime Minister.

During her press conference, the resilient Prime Minister was asked how many wickets need to fall in her Cabinet before she resigns. And Mrs May cited the former England batsman as her Brexit inspiration. Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it. And he got the runs in the end. Im going to do my job of getting the best deal for Britain, she declared. Am I going to see this through  Yes, our leader said. It was a reference to the prolic former Yorkshire cricketer widely regarded as one of Englands most successful opening batsmen, thanks to a stubborn belligerence and staying power. The quip has been widely shared on Twitter since.  Boycott is famed for a rigid playing style centred on intense concentration and solid defence. Mrs May previously described him as a batsman whose priority was the occupation of the crease, fastidiously accumulating runs at a snail’s pace. The right-handed batsman, who has since become a successful commentator, played  Test matches against Australia during Ashes competitions, scoring , runs with seven centuries. But he was once run out on purpose by a young Ian Botham, the all rounder frustrated that his captain was not scoring runs fast enough and under orders from the vice captain to get him out.He played for Yorkshire from  to , and made his Test debut in . His last Test was in .And Mrs May has indeed displayed similar resilience and graft today, after seven letters of resignation, including two from Cabinet ministers .  During her tumultuous day, the Prime Minister also faced letters calling for a vote for no confidence from several MPs, notably Jacob Rees-Mogg. The influential Brexiteer confronted Mrs May with his no confidence letter and told her that her words and deeds no longer match. But speaking at the press conference, Mrs May also said: My approach throughout has been to put the national interest first - not a partisan interest and certainly not my own political interest. If we do not move forward with that agreement nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow.

Judi James, a leading communication ace, toldthe Prime Minister won the dance-off against Rees-Mogg despite showing several signs of tiredness at Number  Downing Street. She also compared her nemesis and influential Brexiteer Rees-Mogg to a Bond villain and Ming the Merciless, the ruthless tyrant in the Flash Gordon comic. Nevertheless, Mrs May vowed to stand and fight in a stubborn statement warning of consequencesshe is forced from power. Speaking exclusively to , Ms James said: Despite the presidential setting of her statement tonight the start of her speech was so poorly and ambiguously worded and her and her facial expression initially so drawn that it was dficult to guess whether her aim was to resign or to fight another day.  In the end she mustered her energy and gave a speech that was a reiteration of her stance in Parliament this afternoon, only with several verbal and non-verbal swerves to avoid questions about the very obvious problem of the cabinet resignations and the Ming the Merciless stance being taken by Rees-Mogg. For sheer resilience and grit it looks as though she could have won the dance-off against Rees-Mogg.  She clearly showed several signs of tiredness, with her face getting shiny and her words becoming confused at times, but she corrected herself with good humour, rolling her eyes to the ceiling when she called a reporter by the wrong name and throwing her hands to her face in a gesture of mock-shock that sadly also probably provided the papers with their shot for tomorrows front covers. May has lost some of the steel that she can show when shes battling at her best, but to fight back from a last cricketing-based press question by comparing herself to Boycott as her exit line suggested shes not going to give up easily any time now.  After three solid hours of grilling in the Commons, where her own backbenchers provided most of the open back-stabbing, and then this speech and press questions May is still clinging to her Brexit solution with no body language clues or tells suggesting she secretly knows she is trying to bluff or sell the country a load of snake oil. She arrived in the House looking puffily pink-eyed but her emotional display today ranged from a very normal-looking sparring with Corbyn where she raised a finger of power and righteousness or sat laughing and mocking his points, to a more charming and patient-looking fielding of questions from the benches on his side through to some much more testy and impatient-looking replies to questions from her own benches. Her responses to her back-benchers involved a speeding up of her verbal delivery and a staring ahead to suggest shes had more than enough of the dissenters in her own party and it was then that she looked truly rattled.  When Rees-Mogg threw his killer point and then sat back to use the unblinking stare of a Bond villain though she carried on regardless and this repeated assertion that she is doing what is the best for the country does seem to be her genuine belief that she could stick to whether anyone  believes it or not. Was it Custers last stand  She looks isolated, and clearly tiredness was understandably a problem, but her constant repetition andto her core message and her emphasis of the dangers of any alternatives suggests she could stick to her guns, genuinely believing she is right, to the bitter end.

Its his big moment - the pinnacle of months of campaigning for a hard Brexit he knew the Prime Minister wouldnt deliver. The famously plummy-voiced Old Etonian chairs the European Research Group, a forum for the Tories extreme Eurosceptic backbenchers. Today he wrote to Graham Brady, the chair of the influential  committee of Tory MPs calling for a vote of no confidence in Mrs Mays leadership - and his group urged others to follow suit. Its likely to start an avalanche of similar letters to Brady, andhe gets  therell be a vote. If Mrs May loses the vote, shes out.  So who is Jacob Rees-Mogg - and more importantly, what are his views on issues that arent all about Brexit  Heres a quick reminder. Who is Jacob Rees-Mogg   Parliamentary history geek Mr Rees-Mogg, who even wears a double-breasted suit in family snaps, is the son of a former Times newspaper editor and amassed a vast fortune through his City firm Somerset Capital Management. He has six eccentrically-named children with his aristocrat we Helena, whose ancestors include Charles I advisor Thomas Wentworth and former Prime Minister Charles Watson-Wentworth. A painting of his horse hangs in the National Gallery. Her family inherited the sumptuous stately home Wentworth Woodhouse, which was given a pound.million repair grant by the Tory government last year despite soaring homelessness. Mr Rees-Moggs quirky mannerisms have given him a cult status among Tory activists with one, Ross Atkinson, getting a tattoo of the word Moggmentum on his chest. The Mirror later revealed Facebook rants in which Mr Atkinson complained sex assaults were a cultural norm for refugees.  He sparked fury last year by claiming the huge rise of food banks is uplting. The free marketeer insisted the state cant do everything adding: I think there is a need for some private charity on top of what the state provides. The MP told LBC radio: I dont think the state can do everything that it tries. It provides a base of welfare that should allow people to make ends meet during the course of the week but on some occasions that will not work. And to have charitable support given by people voluntarily to support their fellow citizens I think is rather uplting and shows what a good compassionate country we are. There are two Trussell Trust food banks alone in the MPs North East Somerset constituency, while he lives in a Grade II-listed manor house with Helena, the children and a nanny.  Committed Catholic Mr Rees-Mogg said last year he is opposed to abortion, even for women who have been raped. The traditionalist backbencher said he was “completely opposed” to abortion, adding: “Le begins at the point of conception.” Askedhis opposition was so absolute it included cases of rape and incest, he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I’m afraid so. Le is sacrosanct. It begins at the point of conception, and I think it is wrong.” Labours Yvette Cooper said the idea that the Conservative Party would consider someone with Mr Rees-Moggs views as a potential leader was an appalling thought. She added: Eveybody’s entitled to their own personal views and their own personal views and their own conscience views about an issue like abortion, but for somebody who the Conservative Party seem to be suggesting could be the next Prime Minister to want to control women’s bodies in this way, even in cases like rape and incest, I personally find quite shocking.  Speaking at a fringe event at Conservative Party Conference, he said: “I loathe this idea that we’ve got to give baubles to young people. I think it is so desperately condescending. Young people are not some alien species that we have to treat dferently from other voters.” Of Labour he added: “Of course they want to give everyone free tuition. because they’re socialists. They like spending other people’s money. That’s what socialists do.”  In a  article he said zero-hour contracts were an excellent way for students to find work in the university holiday. People find these contracts could be an important stepping stone from unemployment and welfare dependency to employment, he declared. They benefit business, consumers and taxpayers by keeping costs down. And he claimed Labours campaign against the exploitative measures was the standard response of the left to market forces. And he opposes gay marriage  Last year Mr Rees-Mogg said he supported the teachings of the Catholic church, which opposes same sex marriage, because marriage is a “sacrament.” He added: “The teaching of the Catholic church is completely clear. The marriage issue is the important thing. This is not how people arrange their lives. It’s that marriage is a sacrament, and a sacrament is under the authority of the church, not of the state.

A deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it chances of survival are fading. Theresa May faces defeat for the deal in the Commons, a Tory no confidence vote, and seven resignations - including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey. As time runs out, plans are now being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and have to stockpile food and medicine at the stroke of pm. The government has issued  technical notices on the practical effects of No Deal - everything from driving licences to cats. FOLLOW IT LIVE HERE  A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But thats not what whove written this guide for. More than enough has been written about business. Instead we have looked through the facts to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader - and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen.  No Deal will happenBritain cant find a compromise between all these issues that keeps everyone happy enough before  March . It will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increase the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . . You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There would be a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least four months before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on  March  would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November , government papers warn.  The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  Flights could be grounded in a worse case No Deal Brexit. British airlines hoping to fly planes between the EU and UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the government admits. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. The government says it envisages granting permission to EU airlines and getting permission to fly in the EU. But Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said there was a risk that flights would be groundedgoodwill fails. He told MPs: “It’s not implausible, it’s not impossible. It could happen deliberately, it could happen by mistake. It depends on how friendly or unfriendly the accompanying music is while all this goes on.” . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you may need an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents would be sold at , post offices from February. Currently theyre sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left stranded with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your cheap holiday bus to the continent faces being cancelled  The government warns UK coach operators may be unable to access the EU at all. Currently, the EU is part of the “Interbus Agreement”, which allows for coach operators to run occasional and regular services in other countries. The plan is for Britain to rejoin the agreement as a third country member. The new agreement will only apply to occasional services - so coach holidays and tours can continue. But regular services would not be permitted. The documents urge UK operators to rewrite their terms and conditions to allow them to subcontract some or all of their journeys to EU-based operators. The document also warns new checks at EU borders are could cause delays at ports. But the government promises “contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.”  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, deal is reached at a technical level between the UK and EU.  November : Cabinet meeting reluctantly agrees the deal after  hours but  ministers speak against it.  November : Theresa May gives statement to Parliament.  November : Emergency EU summit with  other leaders to sign off the deal. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to agree a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. Tory ministers could hand corporate giants a massive tax cut in a No Deal Brexit , a top Cabinet figure revealed in October. Dominic Raab said the government will “pull every lever weve got” to ease business “disruption”the UK leaves the EU with no agreement in March . The Brexit Secretary even left open a radical idea of slashing corporation tax from % to % - which would firms a huge tax break while millions of working families struggle. He spoke on the fringes of the Tory conference hours after Chancellor Philip Hammond said he was reserving “fiscal firepower” to “support the economy” in No Deal Brexit.  A leaked warning revealed NHS chiefs fear RUNNING OUT of drugs in a chaotic No Deal Brexit . NHS Providers, the body for inidual hospital trusts, sounded the alert in a private memo to Tory ministers and the head of the NHS. The bodys chief executive Chris Hopson declared there is a lack of communication nationally about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. Without national planning and coordination, there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices, he wrote.  As a result, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patientstheres no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lesaving drugsports are blocked, meaning they cant be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: Were working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry.  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. . Your local supermarket giant faces having to stockpile food  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiledwe crash out of the EU without a deal. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s MS stockpiling. . You could be affected by civil unrest  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - and the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, eventhose scenarios are very unlikely. The government has been actively hiring experts on civil emergencies to deal with leaving the EU. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recruited three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job description warned any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types.  A major motorway is being closed overnight for more than a month in the run-up to Christmas so it can be turned into a lorry park in case of a no-deal Brexit . Highways England began preparations in October for the M in Kent to be used as a holding area for lorriesthere is gridlock at ports like Dover. But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, was furious. He said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members.  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Kristy Watson, from Victoria in Australia, made the decision to post the photos on Facebook in the hope that no mother, no family ever has to go through the pain, heartbreak and loss she has suffered. The -year-old cafe worker said it was dficult to come to terms with being pregnant as a single mum, following three dficult miscarriages, but calls it the most beautul experience. She praised her body for being strong enough to carry a baby when she didnt believe she could, but  weeks into the pregnancy she had an inkling something was wrong. I knew something wasn’t right, she explained. From the horrible swelling in my feet hands and face, the headaches that lasted weeks on end, the blurry vision, my blood pressure going up and down I knew that this weren’tjust normal ‘pregnancy symptoms’.  But after numerous amounts of doctors visits, in and out of hospital, even trying to contact another hospital for a second opinion I was told it was just normal. Kristy claims that for the next six weeks she was repeatedly sent home after sharing her concerns with doctors. It was not until a nurse sat down on the end of her bed,  weeks and five days into the pregnancy, that she found out she had pre-eclamspia, a condition that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine. The nurse also told Kristy that her baby no longer had a heartbeat. Three days later, she was induced and endured a -hour labour before finally getting to hold her leless baby boy, who she named Kaycen. She bathed him, dressed him in his baby clothes and lay him in a cot surrounded by teddies.  She warned women to listen to their gut, fight for answers and make sure theyre listened to. I felt my sons last movements on the th of July around . to then not be able to find a heart beat the next morning at am, Kristy said. I had to go from having my whole le line, my world move around and be healthy in my belly to then be induced to deliver my sleeping baby. I had lost my gorgeous little boy due to the system letting me down and not listening to me when I knew something was wrong. I had to watch my family be so heartbroken over the loss of their nephew, grandson and cousin and myself because no one cared enough to help when I needed it. I want people to know my story so they know when their gut is telling them that something is not right to fight for answers, to travel back and forth until they know what is going on, to make sure they are listened to. Because I now have to go home to a nursery full of everything I needed to raise my little boy.  To an empty cot that my son never got to lay in, to books I never got to read him, to his favourite outfit I never got to dress him in all because I was not heard. I now go home empty handed with a heart so broken that it’s going to take a long time to heal. She ended her heartbreaking post with an appeal to other women to listen to what their bodies are trying to tell them - and insist that doctors check them over until they have an answer. Please listen to your bodies, I know some people don’t have to go through the stress I had to go through weeks leading up to my sons death. We have to look after ourselves just as much and I couldn’t imagine any other mother having to feel like they failed their child like I’ve had to. She added: Please feel free to share, I don’t want this post to be looked at as a blame on anyone. I want people to know what I went through and in any way help prevent such a thing happening to someone !

It also affects their speech, as well as their ability to move their eyes or even blink. Alex, from Coventry, says he knows when Erin is happy because she always puts her head on one side and says ooh.Erin, from North Carolina, in the US, added that its great having someone who understands her.Their condition is very rare, with only around  people with it in the UK and less than , worldwide. But Alex and Erin found love after meeting on a social media site for people with Moebius syndrome. And despite only meeting four times, they are already engaged.  Alex said: “If I meet people for the first time they might smile at me in greeting and then they are wondering why is he being rude  Why is he not smiling back  And I’m like I’m not smiling back because I actually can’t…I actually can’t do it. The main issue that I have is that I can’t show facial expression, so my speech is slightly slurred, and I can’t smile or express any emotion.As you can also see I don’t have all my fingers and I have not got all my toes either, so walking is quite dficult.  Growing up, Alex had a happy childhood until he reached his teens, when he was severely bullied. He said: I was the only disabled student and I got bullied and I hated it.It just made it really, really hard for me to cope and I was like, why have I been made like this  All my friends were getting girlfriends, I felt quite excluded from that. Dating was really, really hard.If you went onto a dating site and said, ‘look, I am a really nice guy, got my own house, got a good job, but one of the dficulties is that I can’t smile.’Its a bit of a relationship killer before it even gets started.”  But things have turned around for Alex after he found love with Erin. She said: At first, I would never have thought that I would ever fall in love with someone that was born with the same thing I was. But I mean it’s not just the Moebius, we have a lot of other things in common too. It is so nice to have someone that understands me for me.I love his British accent. It makes me melt. It does it just gives me chills. Being unable to smile at each other has meant that Alex and Erin have had to find other ways to communicate their feelings.  Alex explained: I can tell when Erin is happy because she always puts her head on one side and goes “ooh,” and I think although we can’t show facial expression, we know each other’s mannerisms, so when we’re upset or when we’re frustrated or whatever, there is a lot of nonverbal communication that goes on. I think the eyes tell a lot too, even not just Alex, but my family and friends have always said that they can look in my eyes and I smile with my eyes, they know I am happy. The couple have recently spoken to a specialist about the chances of passing on the condition to any future children.  Dr Jonathan Cole, who has studied Moebius syndrome for many years, said: With the genes,it were the same gene that you both had,it was a gene, then that would obviously increase the chance that any child that you had would have Moebius. If you had dferent genes they are likely to be very recessive and rare genes so the chances I would imagine would be less. But then you have to say, well, you have a child with Moebius, so you have a child with Moebius. And there again, who better to take care of a child with moebius, then two parents that have it  But for now, the lovebirds are focusing on their relationship. Alex said: Just having Erin’s hand in my hand, just means the world.It means we don’t have to show any facial expression. And I know when Erin is looking at me that there is a smile inside somewhere. Erin replied: There is a very big smile.- Body Bizarre is on Saturdays at pm on TLC UK.

The daughter of author and local radio presenter, Nicola Harlow, who said that she received a text from her daughter before she went missing that read: I love you, so sorry. It has now transpired that Ursula, whose mum described as older than her years and sensitive had been looking at suicide sites on Instagram and was self harming at the time. Her family attended the inquest at Bradford Coroners Court and were told by Coroner Martin Fleming that there was going to be a lot to take in, according to ExaminerLive . Ms Harlow told the court that before Ursula had left for school that day she stopped by the door and said: I love you. The post mortem revealed Ursula died from a head injury after she jumped from the bridge.  Ursula, who lived with her mum in Halax, west Yorkshire had a history of self harm.It transpired that in five days before her death she refused to remove her school blazer during a cookery lesson. This lead the school to believe she may be self harming. Her dad, David Keogh, was unaware of the pain she was inflicting on herself, but he was worried about her obsession over social media. She had told him about a childs suicide note she had seen online. The court heard that Ursula had got the bus to the bridge with a friend who she gave a sealed envelope which said: do not open until pm. Inside was her suicide note. Ursulas mum told the coroner that she felt fobbed off by her GP after she went to discuss her daughters self destructive behaviour.

Denise Fergus had to wait until the programme went out to learn of its revelations about her little boy’s case at the same time as millions of other viewers. And she was reduced to tears as James Bulger: The New Revelations raked over details of how two-year-old James was tortured to death by -year-olds Jon Venables and Robert Thompson in . She was furious that the Channel  show aired Thompson’s confidential parole papers, which her own legal team had been denied permission to see.  Denise, , said: “I didn’t know what to expect. I was on pins all day before [the broadcast]. I didn’t know what I was going to see or hear in it. I felt like I was an outsider looking in on someone ’s story. I was fuming. He is my son, not theirs, and I was not allowed to see what they were saying about him. “I feel like they consider him their property. He is not a property. He was a little boy and he is mine.”  Denise says she has complained to show bosses about the documentary, which she believes was too sympathetic towards the murderers. And she is also demanding an inquiry into how the confidential parole papers were broadcast on the show this week. They contained statements from Thompson, who told of his “shame and revulsion” over the Liverpool murder as he made a bid for freedom in . Denise said: “Why were they allowed to see them and we weren’t  I want to know how they got them.” The Probation Service was not available for comment last night but it is understood bosses do not believe the leak came from their offices. Denise also felt the programme was biased towards the killers. She said: “I just felt it was all one-sided. They tried their best to get sympathy for them two.”  And she felt it went into too much grisly detail, adding: “When they started going into detail about what they did to James, that’s when I had to leave the room. People know the details. They don’t need to hear it all the time. They didn’t have to do that. “I kept telling myself, ‘Don’t break, carry on watching, just get through this’, but it got too much in the end.” After watching with husband Stuart, , at their home in Kirkby, Merseyside, Denise tweeted: “I’m upset, fuming with the one-sided sympathy with the evil killers of my beautul son.” Yesterday she added: “I think they’d already made their minds up about what they were going to show.” Thompson and Venables, now , were convicted  years ago this month over the murder of James and released on licence aged  with new secret identities. Thompson has led a largely unknown le since his release in . Venables is serving  months for possessing child abuse images, his second term for the offence. Channel  did not comment last night but it is understood the decision not to allow Denise to see an advance copy of the show was taken after legal advice.

The businessman claims his back was injured after having to sit next to the overweight inidual. Stephen Prosser, , who works as a company director, claims he suffered soft tissue damage after the man wedged himself into the seat next to him. The pair were given seats by BA next to each other on the -hour flight from Bangkok airport in Thailand to London Heathrow on January , . Mr Prosser, who is only ft in, claims that the obese passenger was so large that his body fat spilled into his seat by several inches.  The freelance civil engineer said he was crushed against the side of the plane by a ft in man weighing -stone. His lawyers say Mr Prosser was forced to adjust his body and sit in an awkward and uncomfortable position for the whole  hour and  minute flight. Mr Prosser says he was left suffering symptoms from his injuries for the following three months - and is now seeking damages. But British Airways deny the claims - stating Mr Prosser did not not display any signs of injury when leaving the flight. Dad-of-two Mr Prosser said: Id spent Christmas  with some friends in Thailand and was ing home on January , . Id paid over pound, for the flight and usually I fly Thai Airways but because BA had a sale on and were cheaper I went with them. Just as the plane door was about to close, this ft in elk, weighing about -stone got on-board and sat between myself and another passenger who had the aisle seat. He was a huge bloke, not just overweight but really big boned as well. He was a real lump. I felt discomfort as soon as he sat down because I was pinned against the side of the cabin. Im only about ft in and weigh  stone. I suffered problems with my posture -years ago when I used to drive to Kent for work every week so I knew I was in trouble straight away. As soon as the plane had taken off and we were allowed out of our seats I took the matter up with the flight attendants. I asked whether they could move him or move me but it was a full flight and they decided not to move me to a crew members seat because Id have to keep on getting up to allow them to get to the galley.  They said there wasnt anything they could do so I said I wanted to make a formal complaint which I did with the on-board customer services rep. I had no choice but to go back to my seat and the discomfort at being squashed up against the cabin soon turned to agony. To be honest the big guy looked in pain himself as he had his knees wedged into the seat in front so I didnt want to bother him personally. I think its up to the staff to take control of a situation like that and they should have asked the passenger on the aisle seat to swap with the larger man in the middle. But they didnt and I ended up doing a lot of damage to my back over the course of a nightmare -hours. Mr Prosser says he continued to see a chiropractor up until May this year. Defence documents to the claim show Mr Prosser was sitting in a window seat on the plane and the obese passenger was in the middle seat. Immediately after take-off Mr Prosser asked to speak to the Customer Service Manager and refused to sit in his seat. The airline manager was under the impression he wanted an upgrade and told him the flight was full. Mr Prosser told the manager he would have back pain and would not be able to go to workhe wasnt moved. But the manager found the comments surprising after it was less than half an hour after take-off.  The manager said the passenger next to Mr Prosser was well built and over six feet tall, but certainly not fat. British Airways say the passenger did not have fat which was spilling over the arm rest. Mr Prosser, of Tonypandy, South Wales, was offered extra pillows and blankets to support his back - which he accepted. He is claiming between pound, and pound, as general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity. The case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on Friday. Before the hearing, a spokeswoman for BA said: As the case is subject to ongoing proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.

Claire, , married warehouse worker Greg Riley, , on October , she asked people to wear orange, the colour of Batten disease awareness. Kaycee was a bridesmaid on the big day. Some terminally-ill children celebrate half birthdays, and the wedding had special signicance because it was held on the same day as Kaycees. “I cried when I walked down the aisle, but I wasn’t crying because I was marrying the love of my le, I was crying because I was thinking about all those boys and girls who have died from this condition, Claire said. “I told my guests they couldn’t come unless they wore orange. But, seeing them all there in that sea of orange, made my heart swell. Mum-of-six Claires nightmare began in September  when Kaycee began suffering from tics, then epilepsy. Then Kaycee began falling to the floor for no reason, before suffering delayed speech. “We visited the doctor and asked why Kaycee wasn’t developing like a normal child, Claire said. “After that, we went through  months of pure hell – with countless blood tests and MRI scans to figure out what was wrong. “During that time, Kaycee was only getting worse. She was losing teeth, as she kept falling over and could barely walk properly.”  Eventually the family were told Kaycee had CLN Batten disease – meaning her le expectancy was between just eight and . “The nurse who gave the diagnosis had to Google it right in front of us, because even she didn’t know what it was, Claire said. “None of us had ever heard of it. There had never even been a known case in our area, but we were told it was terminal there and then.” Sent home with an A sheet of information about Batten, still in shock, Claire and Kaycees stepdad Greg faced the ordeal of telling her five siblings - Bryan, , Natasha, , Callum, , Tyler, , Tazim,  – the diagnosis. It was a complete nightmare, which will always be permanently etched on my brain. It was truly heartbreaking, Claire, from St Helens said. Determined not to give up, the devoted mum spent day and night Googling the condition, until she found cerliponase alfa treatment. It is a form of enzyme replacement therapy administered directly into the brain which, while not a cure, can slow down the progression of the condition. But, costing around pound, annually per patient, Claire discovered it was very rarely available in the UK. She said: “I got a phone call from the BDFA - Batten Disease Family Association - charity telling us we could have the treatment free –we got in quick enough. “There were only five funded places - as there still are - in the UK and three were taken, so we went straight to Londons Great Ormond Street Hospital to get it.” Since then, Kaycee and Claire have visited the hospital every fortnight for two years for the treatment - funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence– travelling for over four hours each way. Claire continued: “The treatment involves a needle infusion straight into the brain, which takes four hours to drive through a syringe. It can’t cure Kaycee, but it does slow down the effects. “She’s usually awake for the whole four hours, so I have to stay by her side and watch movies with her, to make sure she doesn’t fidget and move anything she shouldn’t.”  One of the most agonising aspects of Batten disease, according to Claire is that, while it can be similar to caring for an elderly person with the same condition, all her daughter wants to do is run around and play with other children. “She has frequent short-term memory loss and can barely recall what she does during the day. Her vocabulary is extremely limited. She can say, ‘mum’ and ious grunts and groans, which only her family can interpret. Often she wears nappies and drools – at her worst times, she’s a mess, she said. Taking Kaycee to play areas is a particular challenge for Claire, who finds watching her daughter stumble and struggle stand up to play with other children heartbreaking, while her daughter ends up screaming in frustration at her limitations. Conversations with Kaycee can also be painful, with Claire sometimes having to leave the room to cry, as she cannot understand what her little girl is trying to tell her, or why she is distressed. “I’m constantly aware that more bad turns could be around the corner. Eventually, Kaycee will need tubes to assist in feeding her, but right now she still laughs and giggles like any other child.” Although they face many obstacles, the family have still enjoyed fun times - such as a trip to Disneyland Paris for two nights provided by the charity Make A Wish in August . And one of Claires proudest moments was getting the news that Kaycee is included in the final three for the Child of Courage awards on November th. But Claire said the Bradshaws biggest celebrations are on Kaycees birthdays, adding: “Half birthdays for terminally ill children are celebrated for obvious reasons. We never know how much time is left, so every minute is precious. ”We got married on her last half birthday this year and I was very happy for her to upstage me, as the wedding was designed to be a celebration for her as well as me and Greg. Our family and friends partied well into the night after the ceremony, and even Kaycee’s favourite teacher at her special needs school attended. “I show her pictures and try to remind her of the big day. I’m not sure she even remembers it, but I want to at least try to keep the memory alive for as long as possible. “Raising awareness for Batten disease was a big part of my wedding day, too. Sometimes it swallows my le, but until we beat it, I won’t leave it alone. “Forget the honeymoon, we can just have a caravan holiday at some point. Every time I go to bed at night she sleeps with me, that’s my way of keeping her safe. “I want her to see me every morning and night. I stroke her eyelashes and fingers and make sure she falls asleep. When I say goodnight, I think, ‘Is this the last time I’m going to say this ’ “Peoples wishes and desires in le change all the time. Mine are always the same - to keep Kaycee with me. I want her to be here when there’s a cure, that’s the bottom line.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sweet way queen subtly praised","story":"NewsSweet way the Queen subtly praised Camilla in Prince Charles birthday toastThe Queen made a lovely speech to Prince Charles on his th birthday - including a tribute to the Duchess of CornwallShareByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  NOV News \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Prince of Wales turned  on Wednesday, and to celebrate the Royal Family gathered to pay tribute to the future monarch.

Bouled was a six bedroom sprawling house and Maria and Derek Broaddus couldnt wait to move in with their three young children. However as they brought in contractors to prepare the house for their imminent arrival, strange things started to happen. And the events that followed threw a spanner in the familys plan and meant that the five never actually got to enjoy any time in their beautul . millionhome.  According to The Cut, Derek, who was senior vice-president at an insurance company, had bought the house after celebrating his th birthday. One night in June after negotiations had closed on the house, Derek was working on the renovations when he discovered a letter had arrived in the mail. The envelope featured clunky handwriting and was simply addressed to The New Owner. Inside was a typed note, which was the first in a series of terrying letters the Boaddus family would receive.  It read: Dearest new neighbour at  Bouled, allow me to welcome you to the neighbourhood.  Bouled has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its th birthday, I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming. My grandfather watched the house in the s and my father watched in the s. It is now my time.  Do you know the history of the house  Do you know what lies within the walls of  Bouled  Why are you here  I will find out. The mysterious writer proceeded to reveal they had already begun watching the house and detailed what they had witnessed over the last few days. I see that you have flooded  Bouled with contractors so that you can destroy the house as it was supposed to be. Tsk, tsk, tsk... bad move. You dont want to make  Bouled unhappy. The writer also mentioned the familys children and askedthey had filled the house with the young blood I requested   They added: Once I know their names I will call them and draw them too me. There was noaddress on the envelope and no clue as to who wrote it, other than that it was signed by The Watcher. The Watcher finished by saying: Who am I  There are hundreds and hundreds of cars that drive by  Bouled each day. Maybe I am in one. Look at all the windows you can see from  Bouled. Maybe I am in one. Look out any of the many windows in  Bouled at all the people who stroll by each day. Maybe I am one. After reading the letter, Derek turned all the lights off in the house and called the police.  Later that night the couple emailed John and Andrea Woods, the people they had purchased the house from to askthey had ever gotten a similar letter. Andrea replied the following day revealing that they had received an odd letter just before they moved out, but in their previous  years in the house had never experienced anything like it. A few weeks later Maria found a second letter in the mail box, this time addressed to them by name. In this one The Watcher boasted about having learnt more about the family - including the names of the kids.  It said: I am pleased to know your names now and the names of the young blood you have brought to me.  Bouled is anxious for you to move in. It has been years and years since the young blood ruled the hallways of the house. Have you found all of the secrets it holds yet  Will the young blood play in the basement  Or are they too afraid to go down there alone. I would [be] very afraidI were them. It is far away from the rest of the house. If you were upstairs you would never hear them scream. Who has the bedrooms facing the street  Ill know as soon as you move in. It will help me to know who is in which bedroom. Then I can plan better.  This letter scared them so much they stopped bringing their children to the house. Then they decided they wouldnt be moving in at all. Maria and Derek had no idea who was responsible for the letters and everyone became a suspect. The police also had no leads. The couple attempted to sell the house, with no luck and were forced to find tenants for the property - but the rent didnt even cover their mortgage. Two and a half years after the first letter arrived, when they thought The Watcher was out of their lives for good, they were horried to receive another letter.   Bouled survived your attempted assault and stood strong with its army of supporters barricading its gates. My soldiers of the Bouled followed my orders to a T. They carried out their mission and saved the soul of  Bouled with my orders. All hail The Watcher! Four years on from the whole ordeal, Derek has finally broken his silence and opened up about how the familys lives were turned upside down by the messages. Speaking to The Cut, he said: I was a depressed wreck. Its like cancer. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night thinking What would my le be likethis didnt happen  We lost Christmas a couple of times, and you dont get that back. Maria also revealed that ever since shed been having terrying nightmares about The Watcher wearing boots and carrying a pitchfork and calling to the kids. They still have no idea who did this terrible thing to them.

But his small British team had remarkable success against the murderous drug cartels in Colombia. The ex-VAT inspector’s unit could not compete in terms of size with the US authorities fighting the same battle. Yet the Brits masterminded the seizure of a record poundbillion worth of drugs. And while the gung-ho American narcotics agents publicly bragged about triumphs, Tom and his team went about things in a typically understated British way by keeping their exploits quiet. Only now is he lting the lid on his time in capital Bogota, starting in .  Speaking to the Mirror in a London pub, Tom said: “We were the British equivalent of Narcos. Everyone’s heard of the DEA [the US Drug Enforcement Administration] and the US agencies doing their stuff in Colombia, and the reason is because they talk about it. “They would say after a seizure that it was down to the DEA in Bogota and straight away the bad guys would go looking for the informant. “We never claimed a single result. No one even knew the Brits were there, because we didn’t want them to. We weren’t egotists. “Our idea was to let others take the credit and keep our heads down. The DEA were looking for glory. This is the first time the British story has been told.”  Now in his s, Tom grew up in Seaham, Co Durham. He joined HM Customs and Excise after studying languages, in the hope of finding adventure abroad. But he was sent to be a VAT inspector in Birmingham. When bosses gave him the job as a drug liaison officer in Bogota  years ago, it was in violent chaos. Weeks earlier Medellin Cartel boss Pablo Escobar – responsible for an estimated , to , deaths during a reign of terror that included the bombing of Avianca Flight , which claimed  lives in  – had been killed by police in a rooftop shootout. The Cali Cartel then took over as the dominant cocaine gang. The Americans, who had dozens of DEA officers there, aimed to take out the top brass of the cartels, one by one.  Tom could not replicate this because the UK did not have the resources there – he had just a handful of staff. Instead he wooed informants – including a prostitute who gleaned information during pillow talk – and found out about shipments before they left. Targeting the ports was something that had never been done. Based in the British embassy, Tom and his network penetrated the crews who raced coke-laden speed boats across the Caribbean sea and identied “motherships” carrying tonnes of the drug to Europe.  Tom – not his real name – developed a network of  informants who helped to intercept  tonnes of drugs. No investigator in history is thought to have been behind more seizures. Corruption was re. Workers were being offered – as Escobarsays in the hit Netflix drama series Narcos, “plata o plomo” – meaning, silver or lead. Most took the money rather than the bullet, so Tom had to offer cash. He added: “The Cali and North Valley cartels were the biggest organised crime groups in history. “Their intelligence services were so far ahead of anything that any other country had in that region, let alone crime organisation. The capabilities of the bad guys was terrying.  Tom, who has revealed his story in his new book Narco Wars, arranged customs training courses as a cover for meeting port staff, and urged them to work for the British government. After spending months grooming a customs inspector in the port of Cartagena, Tom asked the man for information and got a chilling reply. The man said: “If you repeat what you have said to me to anyone  around here, it will get you killed. “You are a nice guy. So I’m going to forget what you said and pretend that I never heard it... I think you are going to get yourself killed.”  While Tom survived, others did not. A key informant was shot dead by hitmen after a friend betrayed him. Tom said: “He had a we and kids, and he didn’t deserve to die. To some extent I was to blame.” Drug lords vowed to hunt down “the Brit” as he became known, but Tom rejected calls toto the UK. He said: “London said come home for six months... but I had invested so much work building up the sources. If I went home I might lose them. I had to plead with London to let me carry on.” It all ended in the early s, when new laws made handling informants impossible abroad. Stopping the flow of drugs into the UK is now down to the National Crime Agency. Recent figures show drug seizures are down to the lowest level in  years. And while alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is on trial in the US, Tom believes the war on drugs has failed. He added: “A lot of [my] friends have died. Was it worth it  No, because we are no better off... The war will not be won with bullets. It can only be won through education and mass media and social media campaigns. These are our most powerful weapons.”Narco Wars is published by Milo Books, priced pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"bank of scotland announces closure of main dundee branch","story":"Bank of Scotland is to close its main Dundee city centre branch.Lloyds Banking Group has confirmed the closure of its Nethergate bank which could cease to operate by February.The Kirriemuir branch is also set to shut its doors along with six others across Scotland.It#s understood there will be no compulsory redundancies following the announcement and staff could be redeployed to other duties.The news comes less than a year after  jobs were axed from the Bank of Scotland  call centre office above the city branch.BoS has blamed the #changing ways# customers use its services on the decision to shut the flagship bank.A Bank of Scotland spokesman said:  “We have made the dficult decision to close the Bank of Scotland Dundee City and Kirriemuir branches.#This is due to the changing ways customers choose to bank with us, which has resulted in the branches being used less often.“We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.

For the -plus who travelled to watch the weekend win at Ross County, it might be well nigh impossible.Because at the Global Energy Stadium on Saturday, Neilson’s Tangerines looked every inch the kind of side that finish top of this notoriously dficult of leagues. That was largely down to there being nothing pretty about this win.Under McKinnon, Laszlo and even Neilson already, United have shown when it comes to quality football,everything clicks there’s not a team in the second tier who can live with them.They can pass any side off the park, keep possession and conjure enough chances to comfortably win a game.For all but a few sides with genuine aspirations to win the Championship, however, that’s seldom enough. This is a ision where the team finishing first must also have the ability to grind out wins.It’s what St Mirren did last season, Hibs the one before and even Rangers found they had to be able to do as they got up two years ago.Even Neilson’s young Hearts side that galloped away with the title in  did, on the few occasions when necessary, show they could dig deep and battle for points.Now, and arguably for the first time since they dropped down from the top flight, it’s a quality United possess.They ended County’s nine-game unbeaten home run since the start of the campaign, not through playing the kind of football of which we know they’re capable, but by standing up to the physical challenge that’s always posed by the home side up there.Yes, United had to do plenty defending, but through a clear game plan, organisation and a willingness of players to put their bodies on the line, it was executed so well that, for all their territorial dominance, the Staggies had very few clear sights of goal.A nice bonus stemming from that fact was, for the first time in his short tenure, in the build-up to the game injuries were a signicant issue.Frederic Frans and Callum Booth were doubts last week and unable to train with the rest of the squad until a Friday session confirmed they wouldn’t make it. In William Edjenguele and Paul Watson, the manager found able deputies.He’s said since he arrived at Tannadice winning promotion would take a squad of highly committed players.He now knows he has that and try as they might not to, the fans must be getting excited."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bec01fb2effb.jpg ","title":"tonight dundees glen kamara buzzing to build on first international goal","story":"After opening his international goal account last time out, Glen Kamara is “buzzing” to have the chance to help Finland qualy for the Nations League play-offs.The -year-old fired in his first-ever senior goal as his country saw off Greece - last month in Tampere to keep up their % record in League C Group Two.The Finns head to Athens tonight needing just a point to confirm their promotion to League B after a superb run that’s seen them yet to concede a goal in their four matches that’s also seen a home-and-away double over Estonia.The team’s successes over the past few months are in complete contrast to his club season at Dundee this campaign.With the Dark Blues languishing at the foot of the Premiership table and goals few and far between, manager Jim McIntyre has urged his midfield to provide more goal threat.And Kamara, who has been pushed further forward by his new boss lately, says he has ambitions to add some club goals to his single international effort.“I’d say I’ve had about one shot in my time at Dundee!” the former Arsenal man said.“I definitely need to shoot more and try to help out the team with goals, it is something I’m working on.”And despite firing in a goal for his country that sealed victory over the Greeks, Kamara wasn’t overly proud by the quality of his first touch.He said: “What was the goal like  Don’t watch it!“I made a really bad touch into a good touch and a finish.“It was great, something I didn’t expect but I was buzzing after it.“It’s a great feeling to score for your country and we got a - win over Greece as well.“They are coming up again so we’ll have to be ready again.”Ranked th in the world and below upcoming opponents Greece and Hungary in the world rankings, the Finns’ record of four wins from their first four Nations League games have surprised onlookers.However, Kamara insists nobody within the camp is surprised at how well they’ve fared.Under manager Markku Kanerva, the Eagle Owls as they are nicknamed, have spread their wings and begun to fly after years in the international wilderness following the retirement of former Ajax great and Liverpool forward Jari Litmanen.That’s despite a lack of household names with Norwich striker Teemu Pukki most likely to be known to football fans on these shores after an unsuccessful spell at Celtic.Momentum is building, however, and the Finns will be hopeful of finding a backdoor route to Euro  through winning their Nations League group.That needs at least one point from tonight’s trip to Athens or the game against Hungary in Budapest on Sunday.Kamara said: “The team is in a good place, the manager is doing well and they are a good group of boys.“Things are going well in the Nations League and we have a good chance of winning our group.“We have Greece and Hungary up this week and with a win I’d say we’ll top the group.“That’s maybe surprised a few people but the team knew we were good enough after playing a few games together and,you watch us, you can see we are at a good level right now.”Kamara’s Dundee team-mate Benjamin Kallman has also featured for the full national side this year, though is more often involved with the U  squad.He remains at Dens Park this week as the young Finns don’t have any fixtures scheduled."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times.

When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

In the words of the National Audit Office, the DWP ldquodoes not know how many claimants are having problems withor have suffered hardship.William Beveridge designed the current benefit system  years ago with the express intention of ending poverty, or in his words the ldquogiant evil of ldquoWant. Today, the purpose of Universal Credit is very dferent.The purpose of Universal Credit is made clear in DWP documents that describe how the systemrsquos success or failure is judged. It aims to increase employment by \"changing the behaviours and attitudes of low-income families.Questions around families being able to cope, experiencing hardship or needing to use foodbanks simply do not appear. There is however copious data about peoplersquos job searches and their attitudes to work.The result is thatyou ask how strongly claimants agree with the statement \"any job is better than none the DWP can give you full and detailed answers. Ask whether those same families can feed their children and the silence will be deafening.A benefit system is always a balancing act between competing principles. Overall cost, incentivising work and ensuring that families have enough money have always been set against each other. Universal Credit strikes a new balance emphasising lower costs and work incentives. These necessarily come at the expense of providing an adequate income.Churches are seeing some of the human consequences of this new balance. Some impacts, such as the run on foodbanks, can be counted. We also hear stories of families needing help to get nappies for newborns, or unwell folk walking for hours to get to the Jobcentre because they cannot afford a bus.Today these peoplersquos experiences are being brushed under the carpet ndash but it is these peoplersquos voices that must be heardwe are to stop Universal Credit pushing families towards foodbanks.The Budget announcement of a few billion and further delays will not rescue Universal Credit.A properly funded ing benefit system has the potential to enable people held back by poverty to reach their full potential. However, this is impossible in families that are simply focusing on finding their next meal. The principle of preventing hardship must be reintroduced.Universal Credit needs a comprehensive overhaul where genuine poverty experts ndash those who face poverty every day ndash are included in the process. This is not an impractical pipe dream ndash Scotlandrsquos experience  are already helping design the new Scottish Social Security System.I do not know what the result of such a redesign would be but I do know that by tackling hunger and listening to those affected by the benefit system we have a much better chance of releasing the enormous potential that Universal Credit increasingly locks away.Rev Dr Richard Frazer is the Convener of the Church of Scotlandrsquos Church and Society Council"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-emphatically-denies-cover-up-of-salmond-allegations","story":"The First Minister said she was ldquoabsolutely satisfied that the Scottish Government and the SNP had acted appropriately at all stages.It comes after it emerged the SNPrsquos former Westminster leader was told of concerns about Mr Salmondrsquos behaviour a decade ago.Angus Robertson, who lost his seat as an MP in , was reportedly told female employees at Edinburgh Airport had complained about the former First Minister.Police interviewed staff at the transport hub last week as part of their ongoing investigation into sexual harassment claims against Mr Salmond.Asked about the revelations by Sky News, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoI understand public and media interest in this story, but as I have discussed previously there are ongoing legal processes right now.ldquoWe are in the midst of a civil court action between Alex Salmond and the Scottish Government.ldquoAs we know, there are ongoing police inquiries.

However no official complaint was ever made.The SNP Government has repeatedly insisted there were no recorded complaints against Mr Salmond before January.Mr Robertson lost his seat in June  but continued as the SNPrsquos deputy leader until earlier this year.He previously said: ldquoGiven ongoing inquiries Irsquom not making any comments at this stage."},{"url":null,"title":"can-britains-weeble-prime-minister-wobble-on","story":"The prime minister - just like the s toy - has somehow, just somehow found an internal equilibrium that keeps her upright.For nearly two and a half years Mrs May has kept power and, in public at least, her cool.And she has done so as rival factions in her own party tried to pull her one way or another on the issue that ides her party and Britain: Europe.Whatever your take on her politics, the PMs political balancing act has been truly impressive. She has broken the first rule of democratic power: she has displeased most of the people most of the time - and yet stayed in office. That is not easy.There is, of course, a political explanation for her endurance. Her party does not want to fight a leadership contest that would be yet another battle in a decades-long civil war over the EU. Michael Keating, professor of politics at Aberdeen University, explains: \"There could be no agreement about her replacement because there could be no agreement about Brexit.\"Mrs May balances Remainers and Leavers in her own cabinet. And not always successfully. She has lost two Johnson brothers from her government, Leaver Boris and Remainer Jo.The politics may explain why she has managed to stay. It must, however, take character to want to do so. Mrs May, even her enemies privately admit, has been dogged, determined, thrawn. She has stickability.There is another word those complimenting Mrs May reach for. It is far from traditional praise: Britains prime minister is, well, relatively normal.In an age of demagoguery, of populism and of Twitter tantrums, Mrs May also stands out as much for what she is not as for much as for what she is.Because - let us say it out loud - the prime minister is not Donald Trump. Imagine how Americas thin-skinned president would have responded to the kind of pressure his UK counterpart has endured The prime minister does not have the folksy easy charm of a Blair, or even a Clinton or a Bush. Voters probably would not want a beer with her. Or even a sherry. She may be of the right, but she is of the mainstream right. She can still fit on to a political spectrum of a European liberal democracy. A replacement may not.Speaking just as Mrs May was elected, PJ ORourke, the American republican commentator, through grinning but gritted teeth, endorsed Hillary Clinton. \"I mean, shes wrong about absolutely everything,\" he explained. \"But shes wrong within normal parameters.Would Boris Johnson be \"within normal parameters\"  Nigel Farage  Arron Banks Would Jeremy Corbyn  Maybe. But the Labour leader, even as the grim reality of Brexit becomes clear, cannot quite convince enough Britons he is PM material. Mrs Mays Tories, despite everything, despite a raging binfire over Europe, remain clear in the polls.David Cameron was blandly \"within normal parameters\". The Tory prime-minister-cum-PRman tried and failed his own balancing act between what was then called Eurosceptics and Europhiles. His solution was a referendum on EU membership. His Remainer side lost and he quit. Now there was a Weeble who wobbled and very much fell down.Mr Camerons party avoided a membership vote for a new leader - one Prof Keating reckons could never be won by a Remainer.

This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable.ldquoBut the choice was this deal which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country, or going back to square one, with more ision, more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum.ldquoItrsquos my job as Prime Minister to explain the decisions that the Government has taken, and I stand ready to do that ndash beginning tomorrow with a statement in Parliament.ldquoButI might end by just saying this: I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest, and I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.Boos and shouts from anti-Brexit campaigners could be heard as Mrs May spoke.It came after a dramatic day which saw an unprecedented intervention from Scottish Tory MPs over post-Brexit fishing rights.The -strong group insisted the UK ldquocannot remain in the Common Fisheries Policy after the end of the transition period.However Scottish Secretary David Mundell ndash who was among the signatories and was widely rumoured to be considering his position ndash later appeared to throw his weight behind Mrs Mays deal.Meanwhile, Brexiteers within the Tory Party ramped up their rhetoric. Earlier in the day, prominent Leaver Peter Bone warned Mrs May she risked losing the support of \"many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country\".Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeted: \"Any cabinet member who is a genuine Brexiteer must now resign or never be trusted again, this is the worst deal in history.\"The DUP, which props up Mrs Mayrsquos Government, has repeatedly insisted it will not back a deal that treats Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.Last night, senior DUP MP Sammy Wilson said: \"Its a poor deal. Its a bad deal. Its a deal that she said shed never accept. I think that people will be appalled at this deal.News an agreement had been reached between EU and UK officials broke on Tuesday. The full, -page text was published last night.It includes plans for a -month transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March , as well as a so-called orce bill which is believed to be around pound billion.But controversy centres on plans for a ldquobackstop to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Both the UK and EU will \"use their best endeavours\" to achieve a future trade agreement by July  ndash six months before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, said the European Commission.Should this not be possible, the UK and EU could jointly agree to extend the transition period.Alternatively, they could introduce a \"backstop\" arrangement from January , establishing a \"single EU-UK customs territory\" to apply until a new trade deal is implemented, covering all goods except fishery and aquaculture products.Northern Ireland would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring Britain to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections.Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, told reporters in Brussels: \"In addition Northern Ireland will remain aligned to those rules of the single market that are essential for avoiding a hard border.Mr Rees-Mogg said the plans would see dferent rules for Northern Ireland, adding: ldquoThis is unacceptable to Unionists particularly in Northern Ireland, and Scotland where the SNP will seek to demand similar internal UK border to weaken the Union.The level of Brexiteer discontent has raised expectations that Mrs May faces further letters of no confidence from Tory MPs, with a total of  needed to trigger a vote on her position.Sources within Westminster said the delivery of letters to the chair of the backbench  Committee Sir Graham Brady was \"imminent\".Mrs May described the debate around the famous Cabinet table as \"long, detailed and impassioned\", in an apparent indication that her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers."},{"url":null,"title":"barnier-says-the-uks-draft-brexit-text-is-a-decisive-and-crucial-step","story":"He said the UK would remain \"a friend, a partner and an ally\", that there was \"still a lot of work\" to be done and that the future relationship will be on the basis of duty and quota-free trade.And he warned: \"The two negotiating teams have taken their responsibility. The British government has taken today its responsibility. Now, everybody on both sides has to take their responsibility.\"Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentrsquos Brexit coordinator, also backed the agreement, saying that negotiators had tried to ldquomake the best of the bad situation.Mr Barnier reassured the three million EU citizens in the UK and the one million British citizens living in an EU country that they could continue to live, study and work there throughout the transitional period and \"throughout their letime\".Britain would leave the EU and all its institutions on March ,  but there would be a planned transitional period to December ,  to \"allow business to prepare and adapt before implementation\".The UK has agreed to be bound by a UK-wide Brexit \"backstop\" which will effectively keep Britain in a customs union with the EUthe prime minister fails to secure an alternative arrangement before the end of the two-year Brexit transition period.A customs union reduces administrative and financial trade barriers such as customs checks and charges, and boosts economic co-operation.Mr Barnier said the single EU-UK customs territory, of which Northern Ireland would be a part, would mean that UK goods get tarf and quota-free access to the EU market.The transitional period could be extended \"once\" for a limited period by joint agreement.And Mr Barnier was positive about the EU relationship with the UK saying: \"We are drawing the basis for an ambitious partnership, which we want, which is a free trade area based on regulatory and customs co-operation in depth and with a level playing field.\"Our objective is to abolish customs duties and quotas for all goods based on what we are proposing in the withdrawal agreement, a single customs territory.\"He spoke after briefing ambassadors from the  member states in Brussels, as part of a carefully choreographed response to the agreement reached, including the controversial Irish backstop which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event this is not settled by a UK-EU trade deal.He explained that Northern Ireland would stay in the same customs territory as the rest of the UK but that the region would remain aligned to some EU regulations to avoid a hard border.That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to seethey meet EU rules \"in the least intrusive way possible\".Both sides resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.Mr Barnier saidthis is not possible by July , the transition period could be extended - andit is still not settled by the end of the transition, the backstop would \"kick in\".This would involve a joint UK-EU \"single customs territory\", so customs checks are not needed on the border.Northern Ireland would stay aligned to the EU single market rules that are \"essential for the avoidance of a hard border\", Mr Barnier added. He said the backstop plan had \"evolved considerably\" and had been based on the UKs proposal.He said: \"If we are not ready by July , we could jointly decide to extend the transition to provide for more time\"This backstop is not meant to be used. Our objective remains to reach a new agreement between the EU and the UK before the end of the transition.\"In closing, Mr Barnier said:\"It is the basis of a plan. We are going to start working with the  member states, and I will start tomorrow with the European Parliament on this draft political declaration.\"We have reached an important moment in this extraordinary negotiation which we entered into at the request of the United Kingdom. There is still a lot of work.\"I know that the path is still long and may well be dficult to guarantee an orderly withdrawal. And beyond the orderly separation to build something, to build an ambitious and sustainable partnership with the UK.\"In Dublin, the Taoiseach said he as \" pleased\" an agreement had been reached on a draft Brexit Withdrawal Treaty and added: \"Avoiding a hard border has proven to be one of the most dficult challenges.

But it was Mrs May that ruled out freedom of movement, so that meant outside the single market, and so on.In Strasbourg this week Ive done a tonne of media and had meetings with fellow MEPs to re-emphasise Scotlands view on Brexit. Across the board the response of our European friends is \"what the hell is the UK *doing* \"They respect the process that has led us to the result, but they do not understand why the UK has behaved as it has since. In attempting to square an impossible circle Mrs May has produced the worst of all worlds to both Remain and Leave voters.Several have privately expressed sympathy for Scotlands plight, and had a specic status for Scotland been proposed by the UK it would have been examined honestly.But it wasnt, and as long as we remain a part of the UK they cant solve our problems for us. And, frankly, Im not encouraging anyone to get involved in our domestic debate, yet.For the moment, we are part of a member state and for the moment the UK can call on the solidarity of members. Not for much longer.Remember, this \"deal\" is only the exit,it happens. This was meant to be the easy bit.Whatever happens in the coming months, unless we vote down Mrs Mays lamentable fudge now well all be doing Brexit for years.Alyn Smith is an SNP MEP"},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-insists-carpetbaggers-wont-force-him-to-resign","story":"Facing calls to quit himself from a fellow Scots Tory MP, Mr Mundell said he wasnrsquot going to be part of a ldquosoap opera of resignations.Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson suggested Mr Mundell should stand down after others quit saying Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal threatened the Union.Read more:Brexit deal backlash: Live updates as Theresa May rocked by Cabinet resignationsIn a WhatsApp message to Mr Mundell, Brexiter Mr Thomson said ldquono Unionist could back the draft withdrawal agreement because it could leave Northern Ireland more closely bound by EU rules than the rest of the UK, creating a de facto border in the Irish Sea.Mr Thomson said he was asking Mr Mundell \"in the gentlest and strongest terms\" to follow Mr Raabrsquos example.At Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeon also mocked Mr Mundell for not resigning, after he and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson previously said the Union was paramount to them both.But speaking to ITV Border, Mr Mundell instead went on the offensive and ruled out quitting.He said: ldquoI believe that the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together is to ensure we have a deal as we leave the EU that delivers Brexit for Scotland and the rest of the UK.ldquoAnd thatrsquos Irsquom focused on, not being part of some soap opera of resignations, and Irsquom not going to be bounced into resigning by carpetbaggers.It was reported yesterday that a factor in Mr Raabrsquos resignations was his undisguised desire to be Prime Minister should Mrs May be forced out.Mr Mundell later repeated his criticism on the BBC: ldquoAs someone who has stood steadfastly for keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom, I am not going to take lectures from latter-day Unionists who are now using it as merely a hook on which to hang their resignations.\"The Union is far more important than peoples political careers.

Some estimates say more than , ethnic Tamils were massacred.These wartime atrocities and allegations of corruption and nepotism consistently marred Mr Rajapaksarsquos presidency.Last month however on October , the alliance between Mr Sirisena and Mr Wickremesinghe formally crumbled, with Mr Sirisena naming Mr Rajapaksa the new prime minister and suspending Parliament.After a week of upheaval that included street protests, Mr Sirisena announced he was dissolving Parliament and calling snap elections due on January .Since then Mr Wickremesinghe has been holed up in the prime ministerrsquos official residence in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, maintaining he is the countryrsquos rightful leader and repeatedly calling for Parliament to be reconvened so that he could prove his majority support among the countryrsquos  politicians.This week the crisis deepened even further after Sri Lankarsquos politicians passed a no-confidence motion against purported Prime Minister MrRajapaksa.His allies however have now refused to recognise the legitimacy of this weekrsquos vote, further fuelling the uncertainty of the past weeks and leaving it unclear who,anyone, is currently Sri Lankarsquos lawful prime minister.It would be wrong to underestimate just how signicant this crisis is, given that its outcome will likely determine the future course of democracy in Sri Lanka, a country still struggling with the legacy of its bitter -year civil war that ended in .Already a number of international human rights groups and conflict monitors have flagged up the dangers in President Sirisenarsquos efforts to impose Mr Rajapaksa as prime minister.According to Alan Keenan an analyst at the conflict monitoring think-tank International Crisis Group , Mr Sirisenarsquos actions were ldquoillegal, with the result that ldquoSri Lankarsquos democracy is at stake.ldquoRajapaksa appears to be in a strong position. He has the backing of the president and the sympathy of the police and army. The longer he controls the state, the more likely it is for him to win the vote when parliament convenes, Mr Keenan said recently.While this weeksrsquos motion aimed at removing Mr Rajapaksa and his cabinet from their posts is a boost to sacked incumbent Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, few expect Mr Rajapaksa will take such a move lying down and many fear the worst may yet be about come in this bitter contest between the two men. For his part Mr Wickremesinghe remains undaunted.ldquoIf anyone wants to challenge the speakerrsquos decision they can put it to a vote, he insisted yesterday.ldquoWe will now take steps to ensure that the government in place before Oct  will continue, he later posted on Twitter.Just who precisely is prime minister though still remains unclear, adding to confusion over who controls the army and other state bodies. As the stand-off continues and tensions rise itrsquos not just Sri Lankans that are looking on nervously.The US, UK, and other powers have raised concerns over the crisis in this strategically important island nation of  million people. For behind the struggle for power inside the country a bigger tussle for economic power between India and China is going on.The big fear for India is that Sri Lanka, just off its southern coast and on one of the worldrsquos busiest maritime routes, could become a Chinese military outpost.ldquoIndia can ill-afford to ignore the strategic advantage China has gained in Sri Lanka so close to peninsular India, was how Colonel R. Hariharan, a retired Indian Army intelligence officer summed up the threat recently.In Colombo, Chinese companies are constructing a . billion new commercial district, including hotels, marinas and a motor racing track, and have already built a giant container terminal nearby and a huge port in the south.This economic backdrop has only exacerbated the current leadership crisis in Sri Lanka where the issue of how far to accommodate Indian interests has been a signicant factor.While Mr Wickremesinghe is seen to lean more towards New Delhi Mr Rajapaksa has long been regarded as more pro-China. For the moment both giant countries have remained comparatively quiet on the current crisis.Earlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered to moderate in discussions, urging the Sri Lankan government to respect ldquodemocratic processes and institutions.So far his offer has fallen on deaf ears."},{"url":null,"title":"council to consider setting wheels in motion for kintore blackburn link","story":"A new #, pedestrian and cycle route linking Kintore and Blackburn is expected to be approved by councillors.Aberdeenshire Council has been providing new facilities along the A corridor for cyclists on a phased basis.Phase one began in  with a shared use path linking Kintore to the town’s business park, while phase two works have recently been completed linking Kintore with Inverurie.That route is already proving a hit with pedestrians, with an average of  daily users recorded during October.Now the local authority is seeking a decision on a favoured option for phase three works to provide a shared use path between Kintore and Blackburn.In a paper to the Garioch Area Committee which meets tomorrow , infrastructure services director Stephen Archer says the route would essentially provide a facility for cyclists wishing to commute onwards to Aberdeen.Discussions are currently ongoing with Aberdeen City Council with a view to the creation of a connection from the city to Blackburn.Mr Archer will report: “The proposal to develop the phase three works was included on the Procurement Work Plan which was approved at the Infrastructure Services Committee of March , .“A successful grant application was subsequently made to the Sustrans Community Links Programme and a % funding commitment has been made by Sustrans for the project.”A feasibility study was undertaken to identy four potential routes, with option two running adjacent to and north of the A and south via the A underpass being favoured by officers.Mr Archer continues: “While the report does not make a definitive recommendation on which route to take forward, on the basis of cost, implementation and socio-economic impact, option two is regarded as being the overall best value option.“It is therefore requested that option two is now taken forward for detailed design to create a design and tender package before the end of the current financial year that would allow the council to approach funding partners for construction funding for future years.”He will also indicate that while the third option of using the old turnpike road would perhaps not fulfil the requirements for a commuting route, it could have some value as a recreational resource to the council.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local piper Michael Mackay played at Inveruries Keithhall Road cemetary\"  Inverurie piper pays tribute to the fallenviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Naomi is looking for a home.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pm Despite hopes that Kirkwall might be crowned the UK#s best high street, it was Crickhowell in Wales which was handed the top prize at the Great British High Street Awards, today.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

She said: \"Irsquom a strong believer in both the economic and the social importance of the arts.\"So Irsquom excited to be working with an organisation like Wasps that understands the potential of the arts in driving social as well as economic development.\"Wasps is so impressive because it has invested in places like Nairn and Skye rather than just focusing on the central belt.\"It allows people to invest in their passion, it creates opportunities and provides long-term security for artists and makers.\"She is one of two new appointments to the board of Wasps, alongside entrepreneur Hugo Burge, who was chief of the Momondo Group travel search enterprise, which was acquired by Booking Group for  million in .Audrey Carlin, Wasps chief executive, said: \"Itrsquos great to be able to welcome two such talented people to our board, especially as they have a deep commitment to the arts and the creative economy.\"Over the past  years Wasps has become Scotlandrsquos largest provider of high-quality studios and working spaces for artists, makers and creative companies, but we are ambitious to achieve far more.\"The creative economy is one of Scotlandrsquos greatest assets but it needs support to develop and grow.\"Hugo and Dyan have exactly the skills and experience that will help us to make that happen.\"Friday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Stirling MSP hit back at claims that politicians were making speeches about “eating well” after many staff at Holyrood had been “gorging themselves on pasta, chips and garlic bread”.He said the dishwas “one of his favourites”, but he hadn’t spotted it yesterday in canteen.“There’s a place for it – I don’t think we should decry that as a good food,” he said.“The issue is how we go about finding a balance.”Tory MSP Brian Whittle, a former Olympic athlete, said there was nothing wrong with the pasta favourite “How we frame the debate is going to be hugely important,” he said.“Bruce Crawford’s point for example around mac and cheese – there’s nothing wrong with having mac and cheese. I would suggest he should have broccoli with it.”And the row even prompted the Holyrood canteen chef Liam MacDonough to defend his recipe.“We use reduced fat cheddar and semi-skimmed milk to make the sauce, no fat used in the thickening agent,” he said on social media. “So it’s not really unhealthy at all.”Ministers want to increase physical inactivity in adults and adolescents by  per cent by  and to halve childhood obesity by .Mr Whittle had earlier said schools would be a “key battleground” in delivering a healthier environment.He said: “Physical education is about how to be physically active and when we can be physically active.“We then need to ensure that learning can be applied outside of the school.” Greens health spokeswoman Alison Johnstone said young people must be protected from the “very worst aspects” of the food industry.“We have to restrict irresponsible promotions on very unhealthy food,” she said. “We really need to get to grips with that.”Two thirds of adults in Scotland are overweight and  per cent are obese.Ministers are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat.Health secretary Jeanne Freeman said the issues with obesity would not be solved over “one electoral cycle”.Ms Freeman said it was important to look at “what drives the behaviour” of Scots eating too much junk food.“How do we change the relationship that we collectively have in Scotland between food, physical activity, nutrition and drink and so on,” she said.“That is the central point and it is the hardest one to crack.” The health secretary insisted sustaining the momentum over the long term would be “absolutely critical” to addressing the issue.“The core point is about changing the mindset that we have inidually and collectively in terms of how we want to live a healthier le,” she said.“Living longer is good.

The Scottish Secretary came under fresh pressure to resign after Mr Raab quit this morning over Theresa May’s draft withdrawal agreement, warning it would damage the union.: Calls for David Mundell to quit as he defends Theresa May’s Brexit deal Speaking to ITV Border’s Peter MacMahon, Mr Mundell said: “I’m not taking lessons on standing up for our United Kingdom from carpetbaggers.“Only a couple of years ago Dominic Raab was proposing to introduce a bill of rights into Scotland that would have overridden the Scottish legal system and devolution, so I’m not impressed by his latter-day commitment to the Union. I’m sure this is more about manoeuvring and leadership. I’m absolutely committed to the integrity of the United Kingdom. “I made clear at the cabinet yesterday that I needed to understand in greater detail the  pages of the Northern Ireland protocol and be satisfied that they didn’t indeed compromise the integrity of the United Kingdom, but I also take very seriously my job in ensuring that Scotland and the United Kingdom get the best possible Brexit that doesn’t also threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom and that’s what I’m still committed to doing.“I believe that the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together is to ensure that we have a deal as we leave the EU, that Brexit delivers for Scotland and the rest of the UK, and that’s what I’m focused on, not being part of some soap opera of resignations, and I’m not going to be bounced into resigning by carpetbaggers.”Mr Mundell said he backed the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement put before the cabinet on Wednesday despite widespread concern over provisions on Northern Ireland and fisheries.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#.

What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’.

The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

As part of the application the agent has included details of a study carried out to identy suitable existing town centre sites. “The study extended to both Carrickfergus and Larne and identied six alternative locations. These were assessed against a set criteria and discounted.“The existing buildings primarywas as Class B office use albeit ancillary to the main industrial use of the former Michelin factory. The site benefits from existing transport infrastructure and car parking facilities.”Mr McGuinness added that given “the lack of a Civic HQ” Mid and East Antrim Council have been highlighted as the “prospective end user”.He continued: “The existing industrial use of the Michelin site has ceased with a signicant loss of employment for the local economy. The reuse of this existing site would reintroduce employment to this site and potentially attract other businesses”.The Planning Officer concluded: “Given the fact that the proposed building is an existing office block and would therefore limit precedent the shortage of suitable office accommodation in Ballymena town centre the fact that Mid and East Antrim Council do not currently benefit from a Civic HQ and that by council locating facilities at Michelin may encourage further investment at this location, on balance, the proposed change of use is considered an acceptable other use,limited to a temporary period allowing it to be reconsidered in the future under the prevailing policy at that time.”He said the change of use shall be for a temporary period of six years, commencing from the date of approval.The Planning Department recommended that the committee approve the application.It was proposed by Councillor Audrey Wales and seconded by Alliance Councillor Robert Logan that members approve the recommendation. This was agreed with eight members voting in favour of the proposal.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

Mrs Foster described the meeting at the Prime Ministers office in the House of Commons as \"frank\".\"She is fully aware of our position and concerns,\" the DUP leader added in a terse tweet later.It is understood that after the meeting Mrs Foster held a short meeting with Belfast-born Labour MP Kate Hoey, an ardent Brexiteer. Mr Dodds was said to have been \"in deep conversation\" with Tory MP Steve Baker, a leading figure in the pro-Brexit European Research Group , for around  minutes at around the same time.One of the key elements the deal covers is the so-called backstop intended to ensure there is noto the hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republicnegotiations on the future relationship have still not been completed.The deal will create a single EU-UK customs territory with the UK continuing to follow EU tarfs and customs rules, avoiding the need for checks between the EU and UK - including between Northern Ireland and the Republic.However, Northern Ireland will be required to remain aligned with what the EU calls \"a limited set of EU rules that are indispensable for avoiding a hard border\".These include some EU single market rules, including legislation on VAT and excise in respect of goods, agricultural production, veterinary controls and state aid rules.This crosses one of the DUPs red lines, and the party is expected to vote against the deal in Parliament.Mrs Foster, whose party props up Mrs Mays minority administration in the Commons, had earlier warned the PM there would be \"consequences\"her deal treats Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.Mrs May described the debate around the Cabinet table as \"long, detailed and impassioned\", in a clear indication her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers.There were no threats to resign during the meeting, which ended with ministers toasting the agreement with red and white wine.Rumours of possible walkouts continued to swirl around Westminster, however, and the level of Brexiteer discontent has raised expectations of further letters of no confidence in Mrs May from Tory MPs.Sources said the delivery of letters to the chairman of the backbench  Committee Sir Graham Brady was \"imminent\", with a total of  needed to trigger a vote on Mrs Mays position.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker issued a statement that \"decisive progress\" had been made, clearing the way for a special summit for leaders of the remaining  EU states to give their stamp of approval, probably on November .Speaking outside  Downing Street minutes after the crunch Cabinet meeting concluded, Mrs May acknowledged she faced \"dficult days ahead\" as she prepares to seek the backing of the House of Commons in what is expected to be the toughest vote of her parliamentary career. She said: \"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.\"The text approved by the Cabinet will provide the basis of a legally binding treaty. It covers the future rights of EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals in the EU, the UKs £bn \"orce\" settlement, as well as protocols on Gibraltar and the UK sovereign base areas in Cyprus.It also provides for a transition period after the UK leaves in March  running to the end of , with the option of a one-off extensionmore time is needed to conclude an agreement on the future relationship.Senior UK Government officials said the final text of the withdrawal agreement featured important gains for the UK on the backstop arrangements to be implementedno trade deal can be reached.The outline political declaration - which will be subject to further negotiation over the coming weeks - expresses an ambition to achieve zero tarfs and no quotas in EU-UK trade, something the officials said no other major economy had achieved.The facilitated customs arrangements and \"common rulebook\" proposed in Mrs Mays Chequers plan are replaced by the concept of a \"sliding scale\" of commitments and market access, which means the UK would not be tied to an off-the-shelf deal of the kind previously offered to countries such as Canada.\"We are for the very first time opening up a world where we can do the sort of trade deal the EU has never done before,\" one UK official said.Under backstop arrangements designed to keep the Irish border open,no trade deal is agreed by the end of the transition period in December , a temporary \"EU-UK single customs territory\" would be established.This could be terminated only by mutual consent of Brussels and London but each side would be legally bound to make \"best endeavours\" to bring it to an end by sealing a permanent deal on their future relations.There will be a provision to allow the two sides to extend the transition to a fixed date rather than activate the backstop.A five-person arbitration , with two representatives of each side and one independent member, will be set up to rule on disputes, with the chair chosen by drawing lotsmembers cannot agree. Mrs May described the deal as \"the best that could be negotiated\".She added: \"When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear - this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union, or leave with no deal or no Brexit at all.\"But arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote to Tory MPs calling on them not to support Mrs Mays plan, arguing the UK would \"hand over £bn to the EU for little or nothing in \". The deal is \"unacceptable to unionists\", will \"lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws\" and is \"profoundly undemocratic\", Mr Rees-Mogg said."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland has been sold out labour mp hoey reacts to brexit draft deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The DUP will owe an apology and an explanation to the people who voted for them on the basis of More votes. More seats. More influence. More for Northern Ireland.\"Well what exactly were they doing with their influence \"A stark example is that Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules which includes VAT and excise in respect of goods and state aid rules, so rather than the prospect of being the best of both worlds, this would restrict any potential opportunity.\"Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle ONeill accused the DUP of using \"reckless language\" and added: \"The backstop is the only insurance policy we have. This has been a mess, a debacle. There is no good to come from Brexit. There is no magic deal sitting waiting to be done.\"My message to Theresa May is simple and clear. We, the four main pro-Remain parties, speak for the majority of people in the north. The DUP do not speak for the majority.\"We need to protect our economy and that is about staying in the Customs Union, the single market. That is about the backstop being permanent, there unless or until something better comes along.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MLA called on Arlene Foster and the DUP to \"cut the hysteria\" and \"act on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland\".Mr Eastwood said: \"The reaction to a reported Brexit deal by the DUP is both flippant and irrational.\"I would remind Arlene Foster that her first priority is to defend political stability and the economic future of our people here. Its time for cool heads, not kneejerk reactions.\"The best Brexit deal is no Brexit at all but this draft agreement seeks to protect Ireland from a hard border. There is a proper backstop that protects citizens and businesses here.\"The Good Friday Agreement is protected, including the principle of consent. Unionists should be comfortable that there will only be constitutional change when a majority votes for it. This agreement is about protecting and enhancing our economy and protecting our peace process.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long also said while she is relieved a potential agreement between the EU and UK is closer, there remains no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit.Mrs Long said Alliances preference remained a Peoples Vote on the deal.\"We are relieved there is a potential agreement between the EU and UK on a Withdrawal Agreement, including a backstop which meets the conditions set out in Joint Report from December  and which is supported by representatives of the majority of people in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"The backstop is not a threat to the constitutional position here. Rather it is an insurance policy based on existing precedents, and helping us to better survive Brexit.\"However, there is nothing to celebrate because there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit. The backstop is a last resort safety net, the bare minimum to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border. But only as insurance against a much worse fate.

Brexit draft agreement: Read entire  page document Both the UK and EU will \"use their best endeavours\" to achieve a future trade agreement by July  - six months before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, said the Commission.Should this not be possible, the UK and EU could jointly agree to extend the transition period.Alternatively, they could introduce a \"backstop\" arrangement from January , establishing a \"single EU-UK customs territory\" to apply until a new trade deal is implemented, covering all goods except fishery and aquaculture products.Northern Ireland would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring Britain to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections.Below is a fact sheet produced by the European Commission on Northern Ireland.Protocol on Ireland and Northern IrelandBrussels,  November Questions  AnswersWhat has been agreed on Ireland and Northern Ireland The EU and UK negotiators have agreed in full on the terms of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.The Protocol includes all the provisions on how the so-called “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would work. This forms part of the overall Withdrawal Agreement and will apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole or in part, by any subsequent agreement. Both the EU and the UK will use their best endeavours to conclude and raty a subsequent agreement by  July .As part of the Protocol, a single EU-UK customs territory is established from the end of the transition period until the future relationship becomes applicable. Northern Ireland will therefore remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK with no tarfs, quotas, or checks on rules of origin between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK[].The Protocol also sets out the UKs commitment to no diminution of rights as set out in the Good FridayAgreement , and provides for the continuation of the Common Travel Area arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. It ensures that the necessary conditions for continued North-South cooperation are maintained, and preserves the Single Electricity Market on the island of Ireland.This agreement addresses in full the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. It is the insurance policy that guarantees that, whatever the circumstances, there will be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and it will protect the Good FridayAgreement  in all its dimensions, North-South cooperation, and the all-island economy. How will the backstop work If an agreement on the future EU-UK relationship is not applicable by  December , the EU and the UK have agreed that a backstop solution will apply until such a time as a subsequent agreement is in place.Alternatively, the UK may, before  July , request an extension of the transition period. Such a request would be dealt with under article  of the Withdrawal Agreement and must therefore be agreed by the Joint Committee.In the scenario where the \"backstop solution\" would apply, this would mean the following in practice:There will be a single EU-UK customs territory. This will avoid the need for tarfs, quotas or checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK.The EU and the UK have agreed on a set of measures to ensure that there is a level playing field between the EU and the UK.The Unions Customs Code , which sets out, inter alia, the provisions for releasing products into free circulation within the EU, will continue to apply to Northern Ireland. This will ensure that Northern Irish businesses will not face restrictions when placing products on the EUs Single Market.The UK in respect of Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules that are related to the EUs Single Market and indispensable for avoiding a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. Why do you need a backstop The United Kingdom has decided to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union. Both the EU and the UK have committed to avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and both Parties intend to solve this first and foremost through a future agreement.The UK has also committed to respecting the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union – and Irelands place in it.Given that negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship will only be conducted during the transition period, the EU and the UK have agreed to include a legally operational backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, which guarantees that no hard border s – whatever the circumstances. This was agreed in the Joint Report in December  and reiterated by Prime Minister Theresa May in her letter to President Tusk in March , through which the UK government committed to have a legally operative backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. How long will the backstop apply for The aim of the Protocol is not to create a permanent relationship between the EU and the UK. The EU and the UK have committed that they will use their best endeavours to conclude and raty an agreement by  July  which would replace the backstop as contained in the Protocol, in whole or in part. Is there any review mechanism foreseen  Can the EU or the UK ask to stop applying the backstop in whole or in part If at any time after the transition period, the EU or the UK considers that this Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary, it may noty the other party, setting out its reasons. The Joint Committee [as established in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement] will consider the notication and may seek an opinion from institutions created by the Good FridayAgreement . Following discussions in the Joint Committee, the EU and the UK may decide jointly that the Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives. What is the “Single Customs Territory” The EU and the UK have today agreed that a single EU-UK customs territory will apply from the end of the transition period until such a time as a subsequent agreement becomes applicable. This single customs territory will comprise of the customs territory of the UnionNo   and the customs territory of the United Kingdom.This means that:the UK will align the tarfs and rules applicable to its customs territory to the Unions external tarfs and rules of originthere will therefore be no tarfs, quotas and checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK, with the exception of fishery and aquaculture productsboth the EU and the UK have agreed on a series of measures ensuring a level playing fieldthe UK will harmonise its commercial policy with the EUs common commercial policy to the extent necessary for the ing of the single customs territory. Under no circumstances can the UK apply a lower customs tarf to its customs territory than the EU Common Customs Tarf for any good imported from any third country or apply dferent rules of origin.The Union shall apply its trade defence policy and Generalised System of Preferences to both parts of the single customs territory it shall consult the UK on any measures or actions which it considers taking. What “level playing field” measures have been agreed The UK has committed to a level playing field based on open and fair competition between the EU and the UK given the establishment of the single customs territory with no tarfs, quotas and checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK. The economic interconnectedness of the UK and the EU as well as the UKs geographic proximity to the EU are key elements to take into account when regulating the proper ing of open and fair competition in the single customs territory.The Protocol binds the UK to substantive rules, based on international and EU standards. Apart from competition rules, it is based on the principle of non-regression from the current levels of protection under international and EU standards. State aidThe United Kingdom has committed to apply EU state aid rules, in a way that is dynamically aligned to the development of those rules in the EU.For aid granted by the UK that affects trade between Northern Ireland and the EU, the Commission will continue to enforce State aid rules directly as part of the backstop solution. The Court of Justice of the EU also remains competent in this respect.For State aid granted by the UK affecting trade flows only between the rest of the UK and the EU, the UK will set up an independent enforcement authority, which will work in close cooperation with the Commission. UK courts will supervise the independent enforcement authority. The Commission will have legal standing before UK courts and the right to intervene in cases.The Withdrawal Agreement ensures close cooperation between the Union and the UK. The UK state aid authority will regularly consult with the Commission. A Joint Committee will allow both Parties to discuss matters of interest and seek commonly acceptable solutions to disagreements. In case no mutually agreed solution can be found, interim measures and an arbitration system are foreseen in case of unresolved conflicts. CompetitionThe EU and the UK acknowledge that anti-competitive business practices and concentrations of undertakings have the potential to distort the ing of markets and undermine the benefits of trade.In this light, the EU and the UK agree that certain agreements between undertakings, the abuse of dominance by undertakings, and certain concentrations of undertakings must be prohibited in so far as they affect trade between the EU and the UK.The EU and the UK commit to ensuring that their respective competition laws effectively enforce these agreed rules. More concretely, the UK commits to ensure that administrative and judicial proceedings are available in order to permit the effective and timely action against violations of competition rules, and provide for effective remedies. In case of disputes about whether the UK complies with these commitments, dispute settlement through arbitration is available. TaxationThe UK has committed to implementing the principles of good governance in the area of tax, as recently agreed by the Council. These include global standards on transparency and exchange of information, fair taxation and OECD-BEPS standards. It will continue to apply its domestic law which transposes the EU Directives on the exchange of information on taxation, anti-tax avoidance rules and Country-by-Country-Reporting by credit institutions and investment firms. Moreover, the UK reaffirms its commitment to curb harmful tax measures as defined in the EU Code of Conduct.The implementation of this commitment will be addressed by the Joint-Committee. EnvironmentThe EU and the UK have committed to maintain the current level of environmental protection. Both Parties have committed not to lower the EUs existing environmental standards in key areas such as industrial emissions, air quality targets, nature and bioersity protection and environmental impact assessments. The UK will abide by key environmental principles, such as the \"polluter pays\" and the precautionary principle. Furthermore, the Joint Committee will - based on existing EU standards - lay down specic minimum commitments on issues such as pollution, sulphur in marine fuel and use of best available techniques governing industrial emissions.The EU and the UK have also agreed to take the necessary measures to meet their respective commitments to international agreements to address climate change, including the Paris Agreement. Finally, the UK will implement a system of carbon pricing that is at least as effective as the EU Emission Trading Scheme for greenhouse emission allowances.The UK has committed to ensuring the effective enforcement of such common standards in its law, regulations and practices and to set up a new independent body with the task of monitoring, reporting, overseeing and enforcing these commitments. The new independent authority will be able to receive complaints and conduct own-initiative inquiries and bring legal action before a domestic court for remedial action. In this context, the UK has committed to effective administrative and judicial proceedings which will give the right to authorities and members of the public to seek effective remedies and obtain sanctions that are effective, proportionate, dissuasive and deterrent. Labour and social protectionA non-regression provision also applies to labour and social protection standards. The EU and the UK have committed not to reduce their common level of protection provided by their laws, regulations and practices as a result of the implementation of Union law and ratied international conventions, such as the International Labour Organisation conventions and the Council of Europes Social Charter.This includes provisions in relation to fundamental rights at work, such as non-discrimination and equal pay, occupational health and safety, fair working conditions and employment standards, and social rights related to restructuring of companies.The UK will ensure effective enforcement through existing domestic authorities and an effective system of labour inspections. The UK has also committed to effective administrative and judicial proceedings. How will these “level playing field” measures be enforced The enforcement of State aid and competition rules is outlined above.The maintenance of the same level of social and environmental protection will be subject to dispute resolution in the Joint Committee. Disputes on the effectiveness of the UKs monitoring and enforcement of the common standards can, in addition, be brought to arbitration.In taxation, an infringement by the UK of applying the domestic legal rules which transpose EU tax directives covered by the Agreement will be subject to judicial dispute settlement with the possibility of sanctions.The Union will be able to adopt unilateral measures either under the Agreement or on the basis of Union law, and in line with international commitments. These measures may include the possibility to temporarily suspend obligations in the case of non-compliance with an arbitration ruling, safeguards or rebalancing measures , the listing of uncooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes, or action for health and environmental protection in line with international commitments . How can you include a UK-wide customs union in the Withdrawal Agreement  Is it not part of the future relationship The Withdrawal Agreement under Article  can wind down or phase out existing situations or it can provide a bridge to the future relationship.This means that the Withdrawal Agreement may include elements that form the basis on which arrangements in the future relationship are built. The Protocol is therefore only intended to apply temporarily, unless and until a subsequent EU-UK agreement is put in place. Will Northern Ireland be in a dferent customs territory to the rest of the United Kingdom No. Northern Ireland will form part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK, which forms a single customs territory with the EU.However, under the backstop and in order to avoid a hard border, Northern Ireland businesses can place products on the EUs internal market without restriction. Placing goods on the internal market that come from outside of Northern Ireland requires that the processes provided for in the Union Customs Code will have to be applied. Will fisheries be included in the “Single Customs Territory” Arrangements on fisheries will be negotiated as part of the overall future partnership. The EU and the UK will use their best endeavours to agree on a fisheries and aquaculture agreement by  July . An essential condition for this single customs territory to cover fisheries and aquaculture products will be to agree between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities. We have shared objectives to ensure fishing at sustainable levels and promote resource conservation Will Northern Ireland remain aligned to the rules and regulations of the EU  Will Northern Ireland have to apply the EUs Customs Code In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and to ensure that Northern Irish businesses can place products on the EUs Single Market without restriction, it will be necessary for the UK in respect of Northern Ireland to maintain specic regulatory alignment with the EU, as has been agreed between the EU and the UK in the December  Joint Report.This means that Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU rules that are indispensable for avoiding a hard border, namely:legislation on VAT and excise in respect of goodslegislation on goods standardssanitary rules for veterinary controls rules on agricultural production marketingstate aid rules.As explained above, the EUs Customs Code will also continue to apply in Northern Ireland within the overall context of the single customs territory between the EU and the UK. Will Northern Ireland remain part of the UKs VAT area Yes, Northern Ireland will remain part of the UKs VAT area, with HMRC remaining responsible for the operation and collection of VAT, and the setting of VAT rates across the UK, in line with the VAT directive. Specically, the UK will ensure that no business is required to pay VAT upfront when moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that accounting for VAT can continue to be done through postponed accounting and VAT s.However, to ensure that Northern Ireland continues to be able to operate the EUs VIES systemand to share data with Ireland, Northern Ireland will be required to remain aligned to EU VAT rules, but only with respect to goods. Will there need to be checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland There will be no need for checks or controls on goods or persons crossing the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. There will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. The Common Travel Area can also continue to . The UK has committed that this will not affect the obligations of Ireland under Union law, in particular with respect to free movement of EU citizens and their family members to, from and within Ireland. What checks will need to take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK In order to ensure that Northern Irish businesses can place products on the EUs Single Market without restriction – and given the island of Irelands status as a single epidemiological area – there would be a need for checks on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland. There would be a need for some compliance checks with EU standards, consistent with risk, to protect consumers, economic traders and businesses in the Single Market.The EU and the UK have agreed to carry out these checks in the least intrusive way possible. The scale and frequency of the checks could be further reduced through future agreements between the EU and the UK.For industrial goods, checks are based on risk assessment, and can mostly take place in the market or at traders premises by the relevant authorities. Such checks will always be carried out by UK authorities.As for agricultural products, already existing checks at ports and airports will need to continue, but will be increased in scale in order to protect the EUs Single Market, its consumers and animal health. Will Northern Irish businesses still have unfettered access to the rest of the UK Nothing in this Protocol prevents unfettered market access for Northern Ireland products in the rest of the UK. Nothing in this text prevents a product originating from Northern Ireland as being considered as a UK good when placed on the market in the rest of the UK. Who will be responsible for implementing and applying the backstop in Northern Ireland The authorities of the United Kingdom will be responsible for implementing and applying the backstop in Northern Ireland. The EU will have the right to obtain information and request control measures. The UK will facilitate any requests made by EU representatives. The practical arrangements for this will be determined by the Joint Committee, following a proposal from the Specialised Committee. How will certication and product approval work in Northern Ireland Where existing EU law provides for the possibility for an authority body in another Member State to issue product approvals certicates, this option should be used by Northern Irish businessesthey want to export to the EU Member States.On the other hand, Northern Irish businesses can rely on authorisation via UK authorities . UK authorities would apply Union law in respect of Northern Ireland, and could decide to make such certicates valid UK-wide.Products from Northern Ireland can continue to be labelled or marketed as UK products throughout the rest of the United Kingdom. Where EU law on goods is concerned, Northern Irish products shall be indicated as \"UK\". A relevant example would be regarding ear tags for live animals. What guarantees does the backstop provide to protect the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union The UK in respect of Northern Ireland will apply the Union customs code and remain aligned to EU rules and standards on goods. Authorisations by UK authorities for products to be placed on the market, as well as technical regulations, assessments, registrations, certicates and approvals issued by UK authorities or bodies in the UK will be valid for Northern Ireland only. If a Northern Irish business wants to place a product on both the Northern Irish market and the EU Single Market, an authorisation from an EU Member State authority or body will be necessary. Will the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice extend to Northern Ireland The Withdrawal Agreement will have direct effect. This means that UK courts will, in practice, apply this agreement, in the same way as they apply EU law today. The European Court of Justice is the ultimate arbiter of EU law. For issues related to EU law concepts outlined in the Withdrawal Agreement, including aspects of the Protocol, the ECJ will remain the ultimate arbiter. For all other areas of the Protocol, the enforcement and dispute resolution arrangements provided in the Withdrawal Agreement will apply. What  does the Protocol contain beyond the \"backstop\" The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland also contains provisions that address a number of other unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, beyond issues related to customs and regulatory matters, most notably:The Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom and its associated rights and privileges will continue to apply in conformity with EU law, in particular on free movement of EU citizens. The UK will ensure that there will be no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good FridayAgreement , including with regard to EU law on non-discrimination. This commitment will be implemented and monitored through dedicated mechanisms.The Single Electricity Market will be maintained on the island of Ireland.North-South cooperation will continue, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as in the areas of energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport. The report will be published shortly. How will the commitment to no diminution of “Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity” as outlined in the Good FridayAgreement  work The UK will remain bound by the obligations it entered into as a co-guarantor to the Good FridayAgreement .The UK has confirmed its commitment to ensure no diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity set out in the Good FridayAgreement. This includes a commitment to no diminution in rights in the area of non-discrimination at the time of or following its withdrawal from the European Union and Annex  lists the existing EU Directives that have been adopted by the European Union in this area. The commitment to no diminution applies further to all rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity concepts set out in the Good Friday Belfast Agreement.Article  of the Protocol provides that the UK will implement this paragraph through dedicated mechanisms. Article  provides that the United Kingdom will continue to facilitate the work of the institutions and bodies established under the Good Friday Belfast Agreement.The United Kingdom will set out further information on its commitments in this respect. Will Irish citizens in Northern Ireland continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens Northern Ireland will no longer be part of the EU, but a great number of people born and raised there will continue to be EU citizens. They will continue to enjoy their rights as Union citizens under the Treaties. Under the Treatythey will in particular continue to enjoy the following rights:non-discrimination on the basis of nationalitymove and reside freely within the EUconsular protection petition the European Parliament and complain to the European ombudsmancontact and receive a response from any EU institution in one of the EUs official languagesaccess European Parliament, European Commission and Council documents under certain conditionsaccess to the EU Civil Service What will happen to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes The EU and the UK are committed to the PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes under the current multi-annual financial framework and to maintaining the current funding proportions for the future programme. The Commission has already proposed the continuation of PEACE and INTERREG for Northern Ireland and the border regions of Ireland beyond  under a single programme PEACE PLUS. It will now be for Member States, with the consent of the European Parliament, to decide on this. What is North South Cooperation and how will it be protected in the context of the UKs withdrawal   Cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good FridayAgreement and is essential for achieving reconciliation on the island of Ireland.In implementing the Protocol, the conditions necessary for continued North-South Cooperation will be maintained in a range of areas including the environment, health, agriculture, transport, education, tourism, energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport. The protocol recognises that, in full respect of Union law, new arrangements building on the provisions of the Good Friday Belfast Agreement in these and in other areas of North-South cooperation, can continue to be made on the island of Ireland.Both parties have recognised that the UKs departure from the EU gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North South Cooperation. In this context, the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland, as provided for in other Articles of this Protocol, is an essential precondition to protecting North South Cooperation. [] Fisheries and aquaculture products are not within the scope of the single customs territory, see below.  "},{"url":null,"title":"lords decision to block accused peers suspension a complete disgrace","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These were his chums, his peers, I didn’t feel asanyone there was speaking for me.“What does it say about justice when his friends are making the decision about sanctions “He has an advantage over the victim.”Ms Sanghera, a campaigner against forced marriage, had been working with Lord Lester on the passage of a parliamentary bill when the alleged incident occurred in .According to her statement to the commissioner, Ms Sanghera said the peer had told her thatshe slept with him he would make her a baroness “within a year”, butshe refused he would ensure she never gained a seat in the Lords.She finally lodged a complaint in November  with the rise of the #MeToo movement.But Ms Sanghera said the Lords’ decision meant she could not advise others to come forward because she did not want them to go through what she had.She said the Lords needed to wake up and realise that issues of sexual harassment and bullying were not going to go away.Ms Sanghera added: “I cannot say with confidenceyou are a victim of this to stand up and complain because I would not want them to go through problems I have.“His peers, his chums, old men, need to recognise the issues of today around sexual harassment and bullying are very much alive and kicking.“They had the opportunity to send a very strong message today in support for victims and encourage more people to come forward – they did not. It’s a complete disgrace.”Peers had been asked to support the recommendation that Lord Lester be suspended until June , which would have been the longest suspension in modern parliamentary history.But raising objections to the move, leading lawyer Lord Pannick, a long-time friend and colleague of the accused peer, said: “I do not know, your lordships cannot know whether Lord Lester committed the acts alleged against him. I would be very surprised but I don’t know.“What I do know is that the procedure applied by the Commissioner for Standards was manestly unfair.”He said Lord Lester should have had the opportunity to cross-examine Ms Sanghera.Lord Pannick went on: ”Sexual harassment and abuse of power are serious wrongs. Nothing I say is intended to diminish their gravity. But those accused of such offences are entitled to have their cases fairly and properly considered.“Heis facing suspension for nearly four years, his reputation has been destroyed.”Earlier, presenting the committee’s report in the Lords, Senior Deputy Speaker Lord McFall of Alcluith said the commissioner was “a highly experienced investigator”, who was a former president of the Law Society and now sits as a judge.I would like to thank David Pannick and those members of the Lords who supported him today recognising the importance of process and now look forward to restoring my reputationLord LesterFacebookTwitterIn a statement, Lord Lester said: “I would like to thank David Pannick and those members of the Lords who supported him today recognising the importance of process and now look forward to restoring my reputation.”Lord McFall also said in a statement: “I am deeply disappointed by today’s decision by the House to send the report into the conduct of Lord Lester back to the Privileges and Conduct Committee for further consideration.“The committee will meet next week to consider options in response to today’s vote.

It was more of a worry for my parents when I was diagnosed but it’s just part of everyday le now and as long as I stay on track managing it should be fine.”Harry is one of around seven pupils at his school with diabetes and as well as supporting each other they have the added support of classroom assistant Anne Beattie, the diabetes champion at St Joseph’s Boys’ School in Derry, who knows the complexities only too well as she is also Type , and staff member Rosin McLaughlin is always on hand to help as well. Harry knows how vital it is to check his blood sugar levels regularly and keep track of the carbs and he wears an insulin pump which he administers himself when required.Speaking ahead of World Diabetes Day on November th, the teenager said that while he had missed a lot of P and P following his diagnosis, there was now better awareness in schools about diabetes and help with monitoring blood sugars.He also reassured any young people newly diagnosed with the condition that they can still pursue the same hobbies as their friends, including competitive sports.Like most lads his age, Harry enjoys playing football, is also a good swimmer and golfs twice a week.

He loves ‘The Apprentice’ and is a big fan of Sir Alan Sugar so hopefully he will start working here at  to gain some experience.”Currently, there are , people living with either Type  or Type  diabetes in Northern Ireland, and this figure is on the rise, making the need for education and awareness surrounding the condition more important than ever.People with Type  diabetes cannot produce insulin.

It’s the most common type of diabetes in children and young adults, starting suddenly and getting worse quickly. Type  diabetes is treated by daily insulin doses – taken either by injections or via an insulin pump. It is also recommended to follow a healthy diet and take regular physical activity.Jillian Patchett, National Director of Diabetes UK Northern Ireland, welcomed the partnership with Click Energy which included funding for pilot programmes including a new role for Connections Ambassadors to provide help and support in diabetes clinics and also the  Diabetes Volunteer Inspire Awards.She added: “The theme of World Diabetes Day  is Family.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges.

Cavan and Monaghan border-line.The film features farmers, horse-owners, scouts, hikers and villagers as they create a yellow-hued physical representation of the invisible border.On Saturday October , those who participated in lsquoThe Yellow Linersquo were invited to a private event in Stormontrsquos Parliament Buildings to celebrate their involvement and take part in the second part of the project, the lsquoBorder Peoplersquos Parliamentrsquo.During the lsquoBorder Peoplersquos Parliament,rsquo Stormont became a space for the voices of the Border people as they considered matters of global political signicance that to them are intensely local.Throughout the evening these conversations were recorded to be used in future exhibitions of the project.At the end of the evening at Stormont, participants were encouraged to write down fundamental principals about their lives and their landscapes, highlighting what Border le means to them.These musings will be collated by writer Garrett Carr to create a collective statement about Border le, which will be published as the lsquoBorder Peoplersquos Parliament: Yellow Manestorsquo.The evening concluded with a special viewing of lsquoThe Yellow Linersquo which was projected on to the wall of the Ulster Museum in Belfast. Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo: PA Wire Mr Corbyn told the Commons: “After two years of bungled negotiations the government has produced a botched deal that breaches the prime minister’s own red lines and does not meet our six tests.“The government is in chaos. Their deal risks leaving the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say.“When even the last Brexit secretary, who theoretically at least negotiated the deal, says ‘I cannot support the proposed deal’, what faith does that give anyone  in this place or in this country “The government simply cannot put to Parliament this half-baked deal that both the Brexit secretary and his predecessor have rejected.“No-deal is not a real option and the government has not seriously prepared for it.”Mr Corbyn went on: “The withdrawal agreement is a leap in the dark – an ill-defined deal by a never-defined date.”The Labour leader told MPs that the backstop “insurance policy”, as Mrs May put it, would create a “de facto border down the Irish Sea”.He said: “In fact the list of EU measures that continue to apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland runs to  pages of the agreement, this affects VAT declarations and rules of origin checks.”Mr Corbyn also said it was “clear the prime minister’s red line regarding jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice had also been torn up”.He said: “By  under the prime minister’s plan, we will either be in a backstop or still in transition.“It is utterly far-fetched for the prime minister to say this plan means we take control over our laws, money and borders.”Coveney denies accusation of triumphalism in DublinPaedophile former Royal Irish soldier raped girl,  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mrs May responded: “He is wrong in saying we will have not dealt with the issue of the border down the Irish Sea. We have dealt with that and I was clear in this House that we would.“It took some considerable time to persuade the EU to move from its proposal from a Northern Ireland-only customs territory to a UK-wide territory but we have achieved that.”Mrs May questioned whether Mr Corbyn had read the same document, listing what she said were his errors.“I’m really not sure what document he read,” she said. “There is indeed a choice before members of this House – it is a choice of whether or not we go ahead with a deal that does deliver on the vote, while protecting jobs, while protecting our security and while protecting our Union.”The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the draft deal was “already dead in the water”.He said Scotland was “not once mentioned in the document” – something he said was “absolutely shocking”.try catch     .               ..

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo.Mr Coveney was challenged in the Dail by main opposition party Fianna Fail on the language his administration has been using to describe the latest Brexit developments.Fianna Fail’s Darragh O’Brien suggested it would be betterministers remained silent amid the turbulence in Westminster, suggesting comments made in Dublin could be counterproductive in London.Mr O’Brien’s comments came after a number of national newspapers in Ireland proclaimed the draft deal a victory or win, as they referenced upbeat quotes from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s late-night press conference in Dublin on Wednesday.Mr Coveney insisted he and Mr Varadkar had not characterised the deal as a victory.“That has not been happening,” he said.“Yesterday we were very careful not to comment when it wasn’t helpful to do so. But we do have an obligation to explain to the Irish people what has been agreed.”He said ministers could not remain silent.“Because there are many people out there who are very sceptical that it was possible to get this deal done and it is the role of government to explain to people in appropriate language why this deal is no threat to nationalism or unionism in Northern Ireland,” he said.“Why it is no threat to the sovereign integrity of the United Kingdom but instead this is a practical compromise on all sides to allow for a managed, sensible Brexit to move forward in a way that protects core Irish interests and ensure we are not collateral damage from an unmanaged Brexit deal that doesn’t take into account the interests of Britain’s neighbours, as well as Britain itself.”The tanaiste added: “The Irish government needs to be careful not to be pretending that we can influence British politics and not to try to do so publicly either, because we might well find that it would have the opposite effect.“There is a British political system that needs to tease through the detail of this text, that will happen in the coming days and weeks and there’ll be a vote at the end of that.”Rees-Mogg declares no confidence in Theresa May as Tory leaderCorbyn: Half-baked deal cannot be put to Parliament Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr O’Brien said it was not the time for triumphant language when there was a “sensitive and volatile” situation in the UK.“That’s irresponsible and I think you should desist from doing that,” he said.He added: “There’s no triumph in negotiating something that can’t be delivered, so we all need to be mature about this and I would say further that the time for victory and celebration is when this draft agreement is accepted and ratied by all.“Every statement being made in Ireland is being scrutinised and we should be aware of that.”During Dail questions, Mr Coveney was asked whether the deal was already doomed, given the developments in London.The tanaiste said he had faith that Prime Minister Theresa May could navigate the “dficult days” ahead.“Of course there are challenges to selling any package in the United Kingdom and Westminster,” he said.“Many people would say there isn’t a majority for any way forward in the House of Commons and so the British prime minister said last night that she faces dficult days ahead, and I’m sure she does, but she’s resilient and she’s shown a remarkable capacity to get things done in dficult circumstances.”Mr Coveney, Ireland’s minister for foreign affairs, said the deal involved “compromise and flexibility on both sides”.“What we have is a deal and text that follows through on the commitments that have been made and does so in a way that protects Ireland’s core interests now and into the future in a way we can all stand over, I hope,” he said.During the exchanges in Leinster House in Dublin, Sinn Fein TD Pearse Doherty criticised the DUP for using “incendiary, rash and ostentatious rhetoric” in regard to the draft deal and claimed the unionist party represented a minority “narrow” view in Northern Ireland, where % of people voted Remain.Mr Coveney said he did not want the debate north of the border to break down to majorities versus minorities.“I hope it’s not going to be about a majority versus a minority in Northern Ireland trying to win the argument against each other in the weeks ahead,” he said.“We need to ensure that majorities as well as minorities in Northern Ireland are reassured that any wording of a legal treaty relating to Brexit is not a threat to them.”try catch     .               ..

Photo credit: Stefan Rousseau PA WireAnne-Marie Trevelyan, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Education Ministers to the Prime Minister, has also announced her resignation. She described the “regulatory framework agreement for Northern Ireland” as a “real threat to the stability and integrity of the Union”.Suella Braverman, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union, has also quit. She too said the regulatory proposals for Northern Ireland were “threatening to break up our precious Union”.Shailesh Vara, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, was the first to announce his resignation from the Cabinet this morning.Mr Vara said in his resignation letter that “the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom must be respected.”Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab announced his resignation on Twitter, saying: “Today, I have resigned as Brexit Secretary. I cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU. Here is my letter to the PM explaining my reasons, and my enduring respect for her.”DUP MP Nigel Dodds, also writing on Twitter, said: “Thank you @EstherMcVey and others for standing up for the Union.”Dominic Raab becomes the second Brexit secretary to stand down, following David Davis’ resignation from the role in June.In the letter Mr Raab posted on Twitter, he wrote: “I regret to say that, following the Cabinet meeting yesterday on the Brexit deal, I must resign.I understand why you have chosen to pursue the deal with the EU on the terms proposed, and I respect the dferent views held in good faith by all of our colleagues.“For my part, I cannot support the proposed deal for two reasons. First, I believe the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presents a very real trheat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.“Second, I cannot support an indefinite backstop arrangement, where the EU holds a veto over our ability to exit. The terms of the backstop amount to a hybrid of the EU Customs Union and Single Market obligations.Brexit, Northern Ireland and what will happen next - bookies slash odds on Theresa May resignation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally and without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement.”“That arrangement is now also taken as the starting point for negotiating the Future Economic Partnership. If we accept that, it will severely prejudice the second phase of negotiations against the UK.”He added: “Above all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manesto at the last elections. This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust.”The resignations came as European Council president Donald Tusk announced an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on November , at which the withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on future relations will be finalised and formalised.try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Oly-1.jpg","title":"titanic quarter office scheme out for tender","story":"Posted on Tuesday  November  by Ulster Business A huge office scheme for the Titanic Quarter has taken a step forward as the development is put out for tender.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
