Meanwhile, Harry confirmed a rift with his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and told of how his father Prince Charles - the heir to the throne - had cut him off financially. And the couple, who were expecting their second child at the time, also revealed to Winfrey that they were expecting a girl.Their daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, was born in California in June.She was given Queen Elizabeth\u0027s childhood nickname, sparking controversy over whether the royal couple had asked permission to recycle the head of the royal household\u0027s cherished moniker.Harry and Meghan also paid tribute to the Duke\u0027s late mother Diana, who was killed in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 aged 36.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Elon Musk Grimes split three years together","story":"Share this articleElon Musk and Grimes break up after three years togetherThe Life and Death of Grimes - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Harry appear Global Citizen Live New York Citys Central Park","story":"Make like Meghan in a shift dress by ValentinoShop it here!After a week spent in all manner of Max Mara cashmere coats and Loro Piana wool co-ords, the Duchess of Sussex donned something a little less autumnal for her stint onstage at Global Citizen Live.The \u0026#39San Gallo\u0026#39 couture mini dress by Valentino is part of the designer\u0026#39s new season collection.

But I was able to get back in and finish the filming. And afterwards I felt elated.As anyone who has had a panic attack knows, the only upside of the nightmarish ‘am I actually going mad?’ midst of the attack itself is that once it subsides it can give way to an almost euphoric high.After that, panic attacks became regular visitors in my life. After a month or two of these episodes, it was my mother who diagnosed me. She said she’d read an article about panic attacks and thought that was probably what was going on with me.But what to do about it? The triggers seemed to be any situation I felt I couldn’t walk away from without being conspicuous.Tube carriages when the train suddenly stopped in a tunnel caused immediate panic. This paranoia increased the panic and I’d be sent spiralling into a shortness of breath, the craziness in my head and an inability to get a proper grasp on the passing of time.Other panic-inducing situations included things such as meetings with my record label, where we’d sit in a boardroom with the door shut.But the biggest and baddest of these situations was live TV.Eventually I thought to myself: Enough, I need to sort this out.The most popular route to help with panic attacks seemed to be hypnotherapy. This was the first therapy I’d ever tried – for anything – and I was a bit wary.The initial session – with a very well-meaning practitioner – did nothing for me. She put on calming music and told me to lie still and relax, which sent me straight into the beginnings of an attack.After that, a friend told me about someone who had been treated by the hypnotist Paul McKenna.He’d become a regular fixture on TV and claimed he could change your life. I wasn’t sure whether he could really help me but I got in touch and trotted along to his place in Kensington, West London.We spoke about the triggers of my anxiety and about other situations when I’d felt that way.He said to imagine that I was standing in a room, and in the corner there was a television with a black-and-white image on it. The image should be an image of me from when I first remembered feeling out of control.I thought back to when I was little and my mum and dad had split up, and all the fights over where I would spend the time, especially when there was an uneven number of nights to be shared.The image I saw was me standing there at around the age of six while my stepmum explained how Dad was feeling about not seeing me as much as he’d like to.While she spoke, I felt incredibly guilty and out of control.The pressure was too much and I didn’t want to hurt anyone or upset anyone. I simply didn’t know what to do.Paul listened and told me to get closer to the screen and then let the image turn from black-and-white to colour.‘Now step inside the image. Climb into the scene and speak to that little version of yourself. Tell her you’re now an adult, that it’s OK she didn’t know what to do, and that you’ve grown into a happy grown-up so she doesn’t need to worry. It’s all going to be OK, and you can tell her that.’I did what he said and shortly afterwards I walked out of Paul’s house in a daze.I had been completely awake and aware throughout the session, but boy, was it powerful. For the next two or three days I could remember so many details from the time I was around the age of six or seven – things I had long forgotten, sights and smells. It was bizarre, but it really worked.Since that time I’ve had the inklings of a panic attack – the occasional little tug – but never again has it bloomed into a full-blown thing. Whatever Paul said to me that day, in just one session, was incredibly effective in giving the power back to me. I’m so grateful to him. Especially amazing was the fact that he never charged me. He told me to make a contribution to charity, instead, which I did of course.Pretty cool, that.© Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 2021Abridged extract from Spinning Plates by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, published by Coronet on October 7 at £16.99.

Video: Kathleen Harris Dr John Dunbar with a noble false widow spider, steatoda nobilis. Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Photograph: Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillWe should see plenty of action in an hour, Dr John Dunbar says assuredly via email, excited at the prospect. As a venom expert, many nights are spent combing the walls and railings of Dublin housing estates for Ireland’s highly-poisonous false widow spider.Alone in the dark, armed with extended tweezers and a headlamp, he carefully places each one inside long plastic tubes as the residents sleep inside, blissfully unaware.On a chilly evening thousands of such spiders are scattered just out of sight along Beech Park, a long quiet suburban road in Lucan lined with detached homes and webbed hedges. The noble false widow – or steatoda nobilis – first recorded in Ireland in 1999 is far more common than most people realise and its numbers are increasing alarmingly.Within two minutes Dr Dunbar is poking at a web string. He has spotted two long, thin protruding legs, inconspicuous to the passerby. It is the first trophy of 94 that night.Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Twenty bites have been recorded in Ireland, he declares, and the bite is one to be avoided.In some cases victims have experienced severe bacterial infections, debilitating pain and body tremors.Steatoda nobilis is compared to the notorious black widow for a number of reasons including notable similarities in appearance, genetics and toxins. It is known as the “false widow” because in regions where they co-exist it can be difficult to tell them apart.Smaller than the native house spider, chocolate brown with a large bulbous abdomen and an intricate cream pattern sometimes resembling a skull, the false widow is easy to identify.Five or six years ago researchers would have had to look hard for one. Today, a single hunter can expect to bag between 100 and 150 in a few hours in any suburban estate.Thought to have originated in the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries, it arrived in the United Kingdom and Europe on banana boats. Throughout the 20th century it established thriving populations throughout England and Wales, and later colonised parts of western Europe, California, Chile and the Middle East.Although found in Co Wicklow a little more than two decades ago, little was known about its presence here until more recently. A 2017 Royal Irish Academy study confirmed the species in at least 16 counties, but most significantly in the greater Dublin area where it is abundant in urban buildings and around street furniture.As Dr Dunbar walks slowly from suburban home to home, he identifies and scoops up the spiders from virtually every single driveway pillar he examines. His head torch illuminates the undersides of wall ledges, shrubs, gates, guttering, the back of ESB boxes. They are everywhere. After just a short while it seems other native species are relatively difficult to come by.Potent venom“But they do have a venom that’s a little bit more potent than what we’re used to. It’s very similar to the venom of black widows, not quite as potent, but still kind of getting there.”The risk posed are similar to ones posed by bees and wasps. Each spider can give about half of one microlitre of venom, about one thousandth of a millilitre. On his regular hunts Dr Dunbar tells the gardaí he will be prowling. The glow from his headlamp and his intricate inspection of neighbourhood walls are common, as are encounters with neighbours.Just as he is plucking a sample with his extended tweezers, a resident approaches with a fair idea of what is going on but curious all the same. “They are obviously everywhere in this area,” Colm Gallagher says resignedly. “I know what the implications are they have venom and whatever else. But they’re not terribly dangerous.”They do go inside houses, but not usually. Whether for the curious resident, the arachnophobe or the scientist, there is still a lot to learn about these creatures and a race to learn it.“They are here to stay, there is no way we’re going to get rid of them,” he says. “But we really need to monitor them while we can over the next years and see what happens. Now science must tell us what we are dealing with,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Enter our climate-writing competition for primary and secondary students, and you could win \u0026euro2k for your schoolPrice volatility should prompt accelerated deployment of solar PV, says energy groupEurope awakens to cold reality of what happens when wind fails to blow for long periods"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Earlier leaf-fall, even of days, could reduce carbon stored by forestsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said it is “the right time” to ease Covid-19 measures in schools given the low risk of transmission in such settings.From Monday, children aged 12 or younger will no longer have to restrict their movements or undergo contact tracing if identified as a close contact of a case in a school or outside a household.In a statement issued by the Department of Health ahead of the changes, Dr Holohan said that it was “very reassuring” to see the Covid-19 positive rate decrease from 16 per cent to 5 per cent, despite a significant increase in the numbers of children referred for testing in recent weeks.“Despite this increased testing, there has only been a relatively modest increase in the detection of cases in the school going age group,” he said. The comments came as a further 1,459 confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been reported on Sunday afternoon.As of 8am, 296 coronavirus patients were hospitalised, of which 65 were in ICU.Dr Holohan, chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), said that it would take “some time” for people to adjust to the new advice for close contacts. He urged people if they have symptoms such as cough, fever, fatigue, headache or sore throat to isolate and contact their GP and “be guided by their advice”.“Both nationally and internationally, the evidence tells us that schools are a low-risk setting for the transmission of Covid-19 among school-going children and, as such, now is the right time to evolve our contact tracing approach, while maintaining the infection prevention and control measures in place in educational settings,” he said.Close contacts of Covid-19 cases in special educational needs settings and respite care may still be required to restrict movements and be tested, said Dr Holohan.Given the “substantially higher risk of transmission in households as compared to any other setting”, children aged 12 or under who are identified as household close contacts will still be required to restrict movements, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms, he said.Children aged 12 or under who display Covid-19 symptoms must still “rapidly self-isolate, not attend childcare or school or socialise” and follow all medical and health guidance.Earlier, another prominent Nphet member described as “untrue nonsense” a theory that there is a “policy” to allow children be infected with Covid-19 in order to build immunity.Prof Phillip Nolan, who is also President of Maynooth University, published a series of tweets on the topic on Sunday. “The idea that there is some secret ‘policy’ to allow children become infected and build immunity is untrue nonsense. We have had just over 30,000 cases in a population of about 570,000 5-12-year-olds,” he said.“Even if this is an underestimate of the numbers previously infected, at current infection rates (2,000-2,500 per week) it would take 3-5 years for all existing children to become infected. “If force of infection declines as most of those 12 and older are vaccinated, infection rates in those aged under 12 will also decrease, and birth rates (1000 per week) will compete with infection rates to keep the proportion of children with natural immunity low,” he continued.“The current policy is to balance the low risk of transmission in the school setting against the benefits of continuing in-person education. We have time to consider the risks, opportunity costs and benefits of vaccinating children.”Monday will see an end to contact tracing of asymptomatic cases in the classroom. Under the changes, children under 13 who are close contacts of confirmed coronavirus cases in schools or childcare will no longer be required to self-isolate from September 27th if they are symptom-free.The changes will not be applied to children who attend special schools.The move comes after thousands of children were out of school, after they were told to self-isolate or restrict their movements due to being exposed to the virus. Meanwhile, Trinity College immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill questioned changes to contract tracing in primary schools, saying that a “clear explanation” for this decision has not been given.“We should keep up with the contact tracing...I would like a clearer explanation as to why we are not, it’s a very good weapon to use, and it would certainly reassure teachers,” said Prof O’Neill.“For the next month or two, certainly until the end of winter, we should be using every weapon we have.”Speaking on Brendan O’Connor on RTÉ Radio One, Prof O’Neill said he thought children should self-isolate if exposed to the virus.He added that in Germany, there is mass antigen testing in schools. “It’s another weapon...why there wasn’t extensive antigen testing in schools all through this is a mystery to many of us.”Prof O’Neill said that while antigen tests are not as accurate as PCR tests, this can be explained to people, and the antigen tests should be used in conjunction with PCR testing. Prof O’Neill said it was “wise” to not vaccinate the under 12s just yet.He said that while schools pose a risk, if the majority of adults are vaccinated the chance of children getting infected is lower.“If they do get infected it will be a mild, benign disease in the vast majority...a tiny minority of course do get really sick.”Prof O’Neill added that it would be wrong to vaccinate children while more vulnerable people in other countries have not received a first dose. “It’s unethical, we could have saved loads of lives in developing countries.”Prof O’Neill added that he recently attended a conference with other immunologists in Munich, Germany.He said that at the conference, there was a sense that we were emerging from the pandemic. “There was a lot of talk of next spring as a key turning point, by then we should have 85 per cent of people either vaccinated or infected, and that means they are protected.“That means the virus will have gone endemic, and if you do catch it, symptoms will be like the common cold.”Prof O’Neill said this was a reasonable assertion, but it is still unknown what exactly will happen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach no issue with principle of vaccinating children aged 5 plus against covid 19","story":"Taoiseach Micheal Martin speaking at the UN Council for Foreign Relations in New York in recent days.

Photograph: Ina FassbenderAFP via Getty ImagesGermany is facing into a long election evening as early results place its two main political parties neck-and-neck with around a quarter of the vote in Sunday’s federal election.A first projection from Germany’s ARD public broadcaster indicated the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) on 24.7 and 24.9 per cent respectively.A second exit poll for ZDF television gave the SPD 26 per cent, two points ahead of the CDU.Germany’s Green Party finished in third place with around 15 per cent, making their presence all but certain in any future coalition. The liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) finished on 11 per cent in the exit poll, equal to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). The hard left Linke are struggling to clear the five per cent hurdle to return to the Bundestag lower house.If reflected in the final result, Sunday’s result would be a historic disaster for the CDU and a nine percentage point slide in its first election outing without Chancellor Angela Merkel since 2005.Initial results after Sunday’s election echoes the tight 2005 result that saw her squeeze into power with a one percentage point lead on the SPD.“The election result is unclear, it will be a long evening ... we cannot be happy with this result,” said Mr Armin Laschet, CDU chairman and lead candidate.After four terms in office the slump for the CDU was in contract to an SPD surge of four points with its lead candidate Olaf Scholz.“The SPD is back, we’re back on the pitch and I think at the end of this evening we will be clearly ahead,” said Mr Lars Klingbeil, SPD general secretary. “You can see the SPD is up, the CDU is down a lot, people want Olaf Scholz as chancellor.”Election analysis suggested the CDU has been abandoned by voters who no longer believe in the centre-right party’s core competences: economics and law and order and foreign policy.If final results echo exit polls, two coalitions are most likely in the new Bundestag: an SPD-lead “traffic light” coalition with the Greens and FDP and a “Jamaica” coalition lead by the CDU with Greens and FDP.Green leader Annalena Baerbock said voters had given them a “mandate for the future”.“The night is young, we see this country needs renewal and a climate government, that is the result of this federal election,” she said.The tight result - likely to be complicated further when a record number of postal votes are counted -- means a complicated period of coalition talks is likely. Until then Chancellor Merkel will stay on as caretaker leader.Sunday saw voters in Berlin elect a new state parliament with a surprise result: the Greens with nearly quarter of the vote, taking first place in one poll to oust the ruling SPD with 21 percent.The SPD scored a major victory in the small, northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern with 39 per cent of the vote.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"behave normally uk transport minister tells people queuing for fuel","story":"Britain is expected to announce plans to issue temporary visas to truck drivers to alleviate an acute labour shortage that has led to fuel rationing at some filling stations and warnings from retailers of significant disruption ahead of Christmas.Drivers queue for petrol and diesel fuel at a filling station off of the M3 motorway near Fleet, west of London, on Sunday. Photograph: Getty ImagesBritish minister for transport Grant Shapps on Sunday called people to behave normally when buying petrol, saying there was no shortage of fuel and the government was stepping in to ease a shortage of drivers bringing it to petrol stations.In recent days long lines of vehicles have formed at petrol stations as motorists waited, some for hours, to fill up with fuel after oil firms reported a lack of drivers was causing transport problems from refineries to forecourts.Some operators have had to ration supplies and others to close gas stations.“There’s plenty of fuel, there’s no shortage of the fuel within the country,” he told Sky News.“So the most important thing is actually that people carry on as they normally would and fill up their cars when they normally would, then you won’t have queues and you won’t have shortages at the pump either.”Mr Shapps said the shortage of drivers was down to Covid-19 disrupting the qualification process for drivers, preventing new labour from entering the market.Others pinned the blame on Brexit and poor working conditions forcing out foreign drivers.The UK government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers.But business leaders have warned the government’s plan is a short-term fix and will not solve an acute labour shortage that risks major disruption beyond fuel deliveries, including for retailers in the run-up to Christmas.Mr Shapps called the panic over fuel a “manufactured situation” and blamed it on a hauliers’ association.“They’re desperate to have more European drivers undercutting British salaries,” he said.An Opinium poll published in the Observer newspaper on Sunday said that 67 per cent of voters believe the government has handled the crisis badly. A majority of 68 per cent said that Brexit was partly to blame.Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, speaking at his party’s annual conference in southern England, said ministers had failed to plan for labour shortages following the 2016 Brexit vote and called for a bigger temporary visa scheme.“This is a complete lack of planning: we exited the EU ... just one consequence was there was going to be a shortage of HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) drivers.

While Britain was America’s foremost Nato ally, Galtieri’s junta was seen as a bulwark against communism, and the Organisation of American States was backing Argentina’s claim. The State Department’s instinct was to broker a compromise between the two belligerents.The US Senate, by contrast, was in no doubt about where it stood. A motion calling for an immediate Argentine withdrawal passed with only a single dissenting vote (that of the lifelong contrarian Jesse Helms).The Senator who proposed it was Delaware’s Joe Biden who, strange to think, had by then already held office for nearly a decade. “My resolution clearly calls for us to state whose side we’re on, which is the British side,” he told CBC. The United States, he added, should leave no one in any doubt that she was “standing with our closest and oldest ally and the alliance that is most important to America”.I have never bought the idea that Biden’s indomitable Irishry makes him anti-British. Sure, some Irish-American politicians (though hardly any Irish politicians, these days) feel that the one stance must imply the other, but Biden is not among them. Even when, under Bill Clinton, he horrified American security officials by lobbying to get Gerry Adams an American visa, he was not hostile to the UK. His first phone call as president was to Boris Johnson, and his first overseas visit was to Britain. He has stood resolutely by the Aukus pact, brushing off European criticism.Why, then, is he in no hurry to sign a trade deal with us? For the most basic reason of all: he is in no hurry to sign trade deals with anyone. Donald Trump’s malign ascendancy moved the dial on international commerce. Politicians in both parties started repeating his claptrap, partly from conviction but mainly from electoral calculation. All sorts of nonsensical ideas – ideas that had been definitively disproved by Adam Smith two-and-a-half centuries earlier – came back into circulation. The idea, for example, that a trade deficit undermines a nation’s long-term prosperity (there is no correlation) the idea that trading with low-wage economies destroys jobs (it may shift a few low-paid jobs, but it creates many more high-paid ones) the idea that governments should “protect” key industries (doing so invariably makes them flabby and inefficient – as Ronald Reagan used to say “protectionism” should really be called “destructionism”).America’s illiberal drift was accelerated by Covid which, illogically but inexorably, made people warier and more introverted. In the run-up to the 2020 elections, Republican candidates were looking over their shoulders at Trumpy primary voters, and Democrats were looking over theirs at anxious trade unions.Joe Biden didn’t survive half a century in front-line politics without knowing how to respond to the public mood. “As President”, announced the man who had sought Atlantic and Pacific trade deals under Obama, “I will not enter into any new trade agreements until we have invested in Americans and equipped them to succeed in the global economy”.In the short term, at least, Britain has missed her moment. We wasted the first three years after the Brexit vote with an idiotic internal debate about whether we wanted an independent trade policy at all. Then, just when we decided that we did, in smashed the wrecking ball of the coronavirus.That does not mean, though, that there is no progress to be made. What, after all, is a trade deal? It is not, as commentators sometimes seem to imply, a kind of permit that allows countries to sell to each other. Rather, it is a framework that pulls down identified obstacles and prevents the installation of new ones – or at least provides mechanisms for redress if they are erected.We are not seeking to establish some wholly new relationship with America, as if we were Elizabethan emissaries approaching Muscovy or Cathay. Rather, we want to scrap outstanding restrictions.Much can happen through sectoral deals. In recent months, officials have persuaded the US to drop its bans on British beef and lamb – the second being potentially hugely significant in a country that is just starting to acquire a taste for the stuff. They have defused the Boeing-Airbus dispute that had thrown up pointless and vexatious tariffs on products ranging from Highland knitwear to whisky. All this has gone hand-in-hand with arrangements between trade bodies.When Liam Fox began scoping the trade talks, he privately argued that a series of mini-deals might be the easier way forward, precisely because it would avoid a big set-piece that would bring out the worst tendencies on both sides (American mercantilists have their British equivalents in those resentful Remainers who are suddenly pretending to be alarmed about American steak).There is something in Fox’s analysis, but the underlying logic continues to pull towards a comprehensive deal that will provide a framework within which technologies and products yet unborn can circulate unhindered. Consider that each country is the other’s largest investor. A million Americans work for British-owned companies, and a million Brits work for American-owned companies. That mutual ownership rests on obvious congruities of language, commercial law, business etiquette, accountancy systems and culture.These same congruities ought to make the two countries natural trading partners – and would have decades ago had it not been for EU protectionism in agriculture and heavy industry. Similar wage levels and interoperable professional bodies make the mutual recognition of qualifications relatively straightforward. The few tariffs that remain on manufactured goods (notably cars) could easily be swept away.Britain wants greater access for its financial services firms, the US for its farmers. The first is more economically significant, the second politically tougher. But let’s not make the mercantilist error of seeing imports as a concession. Allowing British financial services to compete freely in all 50 states will chiefly benefit American consumers. Letting US beef appear on our shelves will chiefly benefit British consumers.The immediate consequence of Biden’s reluctance to go for a full-fledged FTA is to make it easier for Britain to repudiate the Northern Ireland Protocol. The main argument against unilateral abrogation was that it would hamper trade talks. But with a deal some years off, we should act now, show the world that a new arrangement does not require border infrastructure, and negotiate from there.In the long run, this is about much more than commerce. The friendship that has existed between the two great English-speaking democracies since 1898 (broken once, and disastrously, when the US failed to back the Suez intervention) has made the world richer, safer and freer.The values we now call universal – human rights, representative government, impartial courts, private property, free contract, personal autonomy – were largely developed in the language in which you are reading these words. If they became universal, it is because the Anglosphere triumphed militarily, first against fascism and then against revolutionary socialism.Those values seem suddenly contingent, the world order on which they rest fragile. Power is tilting towards altogether grimmer and more autocratic regimes. In such a world, the English-speaking peoples must again be ready to act in concert. Yes, the primary need is for military co-operation, diplomatic support and intelligence-sharing. But the strongest alliances are underpinned by economics. Our ultimate goal should be not just an ambitious UK-US free trade agreement, but an Anglosphere market.It may be that, in due course, Biden will re-enter the Pacific trade deal that the Obama regime negotiated and Trump rejected. If so, the US would be joining Australia, New Zealand, Canada and (by then) the UK. A deeper Five Eyes trade arrangement could nestle within the Pacific pact, as the Australia-New Zealand deal does today.Perhaps – who knows? – Ireland might one day want to join. John F Kennedy, the first US President of Irish Catholic origin, was perhaps the most solidly Anglophile leader his country has had. He was obsessed with British history, saw Winston Churchill as the saviour of freedom and, deep down, wanted to put right the defeatism that his father had displayed as ambassador to London. It was JFK who, in 1962, knocked aside the doubts of his officials and insisted on giving the UK an independent nuclear deterrent – thereby, ultimately, making the Aukus deal possible.The Anglosphere alliance does not rest on the temperament of its national leaders. It rests, ultimately, on the readiness of its constituent nations to stand together for freedom – a readiness that may be tested sooner than we know. And in his heart, Joe Biden knows it.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Keir Starmer says \u0026#39nothing is off the table\u0026#39 as he refuses to rule out tax risesClimate change denier Piers Corbyn heckles his brother at rowdy hard-left eventGerman election: both sides claim victory in knife-edge race to choose Merkel\u0026#39s successor tooSabina Nessa murder: Police arrest man in Sussex in ‘significant development’Strictly pair Tom Fletcher and Amy Dowden test positive for CovidPictures of the Weekend: Dogs swim in Saltdean Lido to mark the end of summerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lived winter discontent boris can avoid turning ted heath","story":"News last week about soaring fuel prices was the final part of the jigsaw. I did not need any more convincing: this really does feel like a weird return to Britain in the 1970s.For me, it is more than a vaguely remembered glimpse into the past. I became a BBC reporter in the summer of 1970 and, as with all formative experiences, it is a decade seared in my memory. The eerie old mood music is inescapable. I am not thinking of the songs, although it is uncanny that new Abba tunes are being released. The BBC isn’t helping by putting on repeats of Fawlty Towers and The Good Life.For those of us who lived through the 1970s, there is a clear sense that the bad times are back again. It is not a cheery trip down memory lane. It feels more like an awful warning.My first foreign assignment was to Vietnam, to cover the last stages of that “forever war”. In 1972, my bosses at Broadcasting House thought Saigon would fall they didn’t share their thoughts with me, they simply sent me to find out. In fact, it was three years later that South Vietnam was defeated, and then I was in the press room at the White House reporting for Radio 4’s Today programme on the last helicopter lifting off from the roof of the American Embassy.Gerald Ford was the interim president, and the man who took over was the peanut farmer, Democrat Jimmy Carter. He won because he was not the disgraced Republican president, Richard Nixon. The parallel is obvious: Joe Biden, who was not Donald Trump, brought us last month’s shambolic withdrawal from Kabul. For Vietnam, read Afghanistan. A bit spooky, don’t you think?The sharp rise in fuel prices and the ever-growing fear of inflation is the narrative arc which pulls the two decades together. The Bank of England has revealed that it now expects inflation, which saw a sharp increase last month to 3.2 per cent, to exceed 4 per cent before the year is out and remain there into the second quarter of next year. And it’s thanks to the energy price shock that last week queues formed outside petrol stations – once a familiar sight during the 1970s global oil crisis.Families are once again making an early start on their Christmas shopping, amid fears of a toy shortage caused by ongoing supply chain problems. In the 1970s, a shortage of plastic, sparked by the oil crisis, caused production problems for popular toys, from clacker balls and Space Hoppers to the Mastermind board game.That decade saw the first real signs that energy supplies could be crucial. For the influential pressure group, the Club of Rome, running out of fossil fuels was a serious threat.For today’s climate militants, abundant supplies of fossil fuels are the real cause for concern. The Club of Rome was keen on bringing economic development to a standstill with its zero-growth mantra. Present-day climate activists are inspired by the call for zero carbon. They too insist that not only governments but private citizens should take action. We should cut out red meat because it comes from cows emitting methane gas. Decades apart, they seem to share the same conclusion: hair shirts all round.In the early 1970s, I remember a prominent news presenter suggesting we should leave our comfortable lives to join her and others in forming a Somerset commune. To my embarrassment, she cheekily suggested I would be perfect commune material. Thankfully, I never got to pack my sandals.Allegra Stratton is the Government’s spokesperson on the COP26 climate change conference to be held next month in Glasgow. To much amusement, she suggested we could all do our bit by not rinsing our dishes before putting them into the dishwasher. It immediately brought to mind the advice given by one of Ted Heath’s cabinet ministers, Patrick Jenkin: his idea for saving power during the Three-Day Week – when, for three long months from midnight on New Year’s Day 1974, the Government imposed limits on electricity to reduce usage and help eke out coal reserves depleted by union strikes – was for all of us to brush our teeth in the dark.There was merriment partly because, in those days, there was much less talk about the need for the Government to send a message. Last week, when Boris Johnson took a train, and not the plane, from New York to Washington, no one laughed. On the eve of his climate speech at the UN, it was treated like routine PR.In the 1970s, union-backed strikes were frequent, and as I followed Heath around on his attempted re-election campaign in 1974, he routinely argued that the election would answer the simple question: “Who rules Britain?” At the ballot box, the response came swiftly: “Not you, mate.”It became clear in the months that followed that, increasingly, people were not expecting the answer to be found at Westminster. In February 1974, Labour’s Harold Wilson returned to power – but it wasn’t long before his replacement Jim Callaghan was at the helm, desperately trying to keep a lid on inflation with an official pay policy. BBC staff would buy steak in the subsidised canteen to take it home to their families.There was a common view throughout much of the 1970s that the country was, in effect, leaderless, best summed up in the famous winter of discontent headline attributed to Callaghan: “Crisis, what crisis?” I remember at a high-powered political reception a well-known industrialist came up to me and said, without any preamble: “Is Britain ungovernable?” As a BBC correspondent I could not, of course, openly agree, but the mood of pessimism was unavoidable.Britain’s image abroad suffered. On a Tube train from Heathrow airport with a group of newly-arrived Americans, I was startled when one of them shouted and pointed at some allotments by the side of the track. “Look,” he exclaimed to his friends, “subsistence farming.” To him, we were obviously down on our knees.In 1979, it all ended in public humiliation for the Labour government. When there is speculation now of a new winter of discontent, I feel a shudder remembering the rubbish that wasn’t cleared, the bodies that weren’t buried. It is not the same.This is where it is dangerous to make too close a connection with the past. Politics now does not depend on the hope of a Conservative revival. Labour is still unable to pose as a government-in-waiting, and Sir Keir Starmer is no Margaret Thatcher. The unions have nothing like the power they used to wield. Disputes over ideology have lost their bite. The pandemic has forced the Conservatives to become unlikely advocates of the Big State.But Covid has thrown up a raft of problems, too, which has left many voters feeling let down and marginalised. That is why I am thankful the true spirit of the 1970s is firmly in the past. I spent a good deal of that decade covering the conflict in Northern Ireland, and reporting on wars abroad, often at the end of a crackly telephone line. Computer wizardry was in its infancy. Colour television had only just arrived. The human genome had not been charted, and we would not have been able to mount in less than a year a successful vaccination campaign against a deadly virus.It is fun to play with history but, like children, we should be careful about playing with fire. One of the key lessons from the 1970s is that, in a relatively short period of time, how easy it is for an administration to lose control. Now, the country is emerging from its toughest civil emergency since the war.

We repeated the experiments to be really sure that we were not making a mistake and the result was always the same.”The findings support previous speculation about the origins of Samson and Delilah, with some experts arguing that the work is only a copy of a lost original painting by Rubens, painted around 1610.It has been suggested that the work bought by the National Gallery was erroneously declared to be by Rubens in the Twenties by art expert Ludwig Burchard, who was later found to have misattributed paintings for his own commercial gain.A spokesman for the National Gallery said: “The gallery always takes note of new research. We await its publication in full so that any evidence can be properly assessed. Until such time, it will not be possible to comment further.”The painting depicts Samson slumped sleeping in the arms of Delilah, while his hair is cut by a servant in order to reduce his superhuman strength.It has been suggested that the palette used in the work differs from that usually favoured by Rubens, with the quality of the painting not matching that of the master.Rubens was born in 1577 and enjoyed a prolific artistic career, largely based at his studio in Antwerp, producing more than 1,400 works.In 2002, a new record was set for his paintings, with Massacre of the Innocents fetching £49.5 million at auction in Sotheby’s in London.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Keir Starmer says \u0026#39nothing is off the table\u0026#39 as he refuses to rule out tax risesClimate change denier Piers Corbyn heckles his brother at rowdy hard-left eventGerman election: both sides claim victory in knife-edge race to choose Merkel\u0026#39s successor tooSabina Nessa murder: Police arrest man in Sussex in ‘significant development’Strictly pair Tom Fletcher and Amy Dowden test positive for CovidPictures of the Weekend: Dogs swim in Saltdean Lido to mark the end of summerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"strictly pair tom fletcher amy dowden test positive covid","story":"McFly star Tom Fletcher and his Strictly dance partner have tested positive for Covid-19.The BBC announced the singer and professional dancer Amy Dowden had contracted the virus on Sunday afternoon, and said they would be self-isolating.They said in a statement: Tom Fletcher and Amy Dowden have tested positive for Covid-19.The pair are now self-isolating separately following the latest Government guidelines.While they will both miss Saturday\u0027s live show, Strictly Come Dancing protocols mean that, all being well, they will return the following week.This follows reports that three of the shows dancers were unvaccinated, though there is no suggestion that either Fletcher or Dowden were among this number.The show has seen its television audience grow to almost eight million viewers, according to overnight ratings for Saturday.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Keir Starmer says \u0026#39nothing is off the table\u0026#39 as he refuses to rule out tax risesClimate change denier Piers Corbyn heckles his brother at rowdy hard-left eventGerman election: both sides claim victory in knife-edge race to choose Merkel\u0026#39s successor tooSabina Nessa murder: Police arrest man in Sussex in ‘significant development’Pictures of the Weekend: Dogs swim in Saltdean Lido to mark the end of summerPolice body armour may be redesigned to make it \u0026#39less intimidating\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayner promises new deal","story":":root Angela Rayner promises New Deal for Working People in Labour conference barnstormerThe Deputy leader told Labour Party Conference: \"We must become the government our nation deserves, not the one it has\"Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Sep | comments Angela Rayner promised a New Deal for Working People within  days of a Labour government, in a barnstorming speech at the opening of the party’s annual conference.Party faithful flocked to Brighton this weekend for their first conference in person since . Internal rows over party rule changes provoked a bitter atmosphere among some delegates on the first day of the event. But the Deputy Leader’s energetic opening speech prompted loud applause from delegates. She told attendees: “We must become the government our nation deserves, not the one it has.” Launching the party’s Green Paper for working people, Ms Rayner said: “I’m not presenting you with a policy document that will sit on the shelf collecting dust,” she said. “Let’s make this real and show every worker in every workplace in every corner of our country that with their support, their lives, their jobs and their communities can and will be better.” The proposals would see the minimum wage increased to at least £ an hour for all workers.  It would extend full workers rights to all-but the genuinely self employed - including sick pay, holiday pay, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. Flexible working would be a right for all workers as a default, alongside the right to switch off outside of working hours. And zero-hours contracts would be banned, with all workers having the right to a regular contract and predictable hours - with last-minute sht cancellations paid in full. Ms Rayner added: “This Green Paper is for every parent tearing your hair out about childcare, or who missed a sports day or parents evening because you couldn’t come in and leave early. “It’s for every young person who daren’t turn down a sht on a zero hours contract because you might not get hours next week, who can’t take a break and can’t get sick. “And it’s for every worker who went to work and never made it home, and for their families who will never see them again.” Taking aim at Boris Johnson ’s government, Ms Rayner said: “There’s only one rule with this Cabinet and that is that there’s one rule for them and another rule for us.“Like the Foreign Secretary, cancelling leave for our troops and then trooping off to the beach. One rule for them, another rule for us. “The Prime Minister who got pinged and tried to go to work anyway. One for rule for them, another rule for us. “And who can forget the Barnard Castle eye test  One rule for them, and another rule for us.” And she joked that former Health Secretary Matt Hancock “has now been ordered by a court to hand over his WhatsApp messages. “Frankly, I don’t think I want to know what’s in Matt Hancock’s WhatsApp.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetWhatsAppLabour PartyBoris JohnsonMinimum wageChildcarePoliticsLabour Party ConferenceAngela Rayner\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But she added: “No one can say I am trying to emulate Keir and certainly no one will say that Keir is trying to emulate me.” Askedshe wanted to be leader one day, she said: “I’ve seen what we do to our leaders - it petries me! “We are so brutal, even within our own movement we can be pretty brutal to our leaders. “I just want to make a dference.” She laid bare the frustrations of spending her six years in the Commons in opposition. “The thing I regret most about being in Parliament since I’ve been elected and had the privilege of representing my constituency is Iaposve been voted down so many times because we’re not in government,” she said. “I can do a good round at PMQs but that’s not going to change things for working people of this country. “What I need to do is get us into government. If I can get my little hands on getting into government in any way, stretch or form I can, Iaposll do it.”Ms Rayner revels in her role as the confident, bold and brash face and voice of Labour on the airwaves.But she admitted she gets “frightened” touring the TV and radio studios.  “It frightens me to put myself forward all the time in the way that I do as an inidual because it’s a lot of pressure, but I also think it’s important that I’m not there to represent me, I’m there to represent the people that elected me,” she said. “You don’t want to let people down, when you put yourself forward on the national stage like that.” She dismissed the brewing internal row over Labour elects future leaders as argy bargy. Keir Starmer wants to tear up the current one member, one vote system and replace it with an electoral college. That regime was axed in  to give grassroots activists the power to pick the party premier. But Mr Starmer wants toto the system that gives MPs a third of the vote, the unions a third and ordinary Labour members a third. Ms Rayner said: “It wouldn’t be a conferencewe didn’t have some form of argy bargy. “I’ve never been to a Labour Party or a trade union conference where there isn’t an argy bargy on something. “But I do think we should have a respectful debate.”  But the former union official refused to be drawn on the row. Askedshe supported the proposed overhaul, she said: “We will see what happens.” She added: “Keir’s said he wants to look at that, he’s said he wants to discuss it and consult, and heaposs doing that, and I think that’s fine. “What I don’t want it to be is a big, internal fight within the Labour Party - I think that’s very disastrous for us because ided parties don’t win elections.” She feared a row would derail Labour’s chance to showcase policies in Brighton. “I would hate to think that people’s messages out of conference‘the Labour Party are not focusing outwards’ - and I know that Keir shares that vision,” said Ms Rayner. “But you have to fix your internal as well as your external.” She added: “We make no apologies for reviewing all of the issues that we face internally, as well as focusing on the country, because we have to be ready to govern. “Me and Keir are very clear on that.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyPMQsBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps failed to rule out calling on military drivers to get fuel to petrol station forecourts. Motorists have faced long queues in recent days as some petrol stations have been forced to shut due to lack of fuel. A shortage of nearly , HGV drivers has been blamed for the crisis - meaning there are not enough hauliers to get petrol to the pumps. Askedhe’d bring in Army drivers to deliver fuel, Mr Shapps told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We’ll do whatever’s required”.  Pressed againarmy drivers could be on the roads by next week Mr Shapps said: “We’ll do whatever we need to do to make sure things flow in this country, and that’s what you would expect us to do.” He said at the moment the army “make sure we’re testing HGV drivers”. He urged Brits: “Fill up when you need to, then there’s actually plenty of petrol to go round.” Mr Shapps tried to claim the shortages were a manufactured crisis caused by a leak to the media by haulage industry insiders, He said: There was a meeting that took place about  days ago, a private meeting, which one of the haulage associations decided to leak the details to the media and that has created, as we have seen, quite a large degree of concern and people naturally react to that. The good news is there is plenty of fuel, the bad news iseveryone carries on buying it when they donapost need it, you would continue to have queues. He said the demand should begin to ease as it is dficult to stockpile fuel and said the situation could not be compared to widespread shortages of toilet roll at the start of the first lockdown. Asked whether the Government had ignored warnings over supply shortages, he said: Not true, adding: Iaposm afraid there has been some pretty irresponsible briefing out by one of the road haulage associations, which has helped to spark a crisis, and thataposs very, very unhelpful, itaposs counterproductive. I know that theyaposre desperate to have more European drivers undercutting British salaries, I know thataposs been their ask all along. We actually think that itaposs important that this country can train people, that people can do a proper dayaposs work, that theyaposre paid properly for that work, and that the long-term solution cannot be undercutting British salaries and having a constant vicious cycle of not being able to train people here and employ them on decent salaries.But Keir Starmer said the government was doing too little to tackle the trucker shortage.“ there’s , vacancies for drivers in this country and the government is saying we’re going to bring in , visas, there’s obviously a problem,” he said.

During the pandemic, Parliament had to hire six more clerks to help elderly peers socially distance and arrange for others to join virtual proceedings. But the authorities did not want to spend the £, it would cost to buy each clerk horsehair headpieces as they were only temporary. Nor were they willing to cough up £, to kit them out with the two sets of full formal regalia they would need. The temporary staff are now being kept on – but the authorities are still refusing to pay for their official outfits. As a result, all  clerks have been given permission to dress down. Deputy Speaker Lord Gardiner of Kimble said: “Costs would be signicant. “Full unorm will continue in ceremonial occasions and for State Opening, at which wigs will also be worn.” But many peers believe they should have been asked about the decision first. Tory Lord Patrick Cormack, , said: “There should have been a vote. If it had been the majority view I would have spoken against, but accepted it. I am a democrat.” The move puts the Lords in line with the Commons, which axed wigs in  as then-Speaker John Bercow thought them old-fashioned.The clerks also said they itched.

Brits are battling fuel and food shortages, increased food costs and soaring household bills, alongside a shortage of lorry drivers. Mr Miliband said that on top of the fuel crisis, the cost of living has been made far worse with cuts to the Universal Credit uplt. Speaking at Labour Conference, Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary said: Letaposs be clear friends, this energy price crisis is a disaster made in Downing Street, a disaster caused by a decade of Tory climate inaction. Of course they are making the cost of living crisis far worse by cutting Universal Credit.  As Mr Miliband made his speech, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said there is no shortage of fuel. But the former Labour leader got the crowd roaring as he added: If they really cared about the cost of living crisis,they really cared about the fuel poor, we know what they would do. It’s time to cancel the cut in universal credit that takes place in just five days’ time.” Mr Miliband reflected on the Tories lack of action on tackling the climate crisis and recalled the Prime Ministeraposs comments on coal mines. He joked that Mrs Thatcher closed the pits and gave us a head start. This guy laughing about people losing their jobs, communities losing their leblood, generations losing hope. How dare he How dare this arrogant, contemptuous, cruel, shameless, duplicitous, out of touch charlatan, laugh about the devastation of coalfield communities.’  Rolling out his policies, Mr Miliband said: A Labour government will require every major business to tell us their carbon footprint and how it is consistent with net zero. “That’s what we mean by delivering climate justice and economic justice together. “ Mr Miliband said gas prices are surging because the Government has not done enough, leaving the economy vulnerable to price instability of the international gas market. Speaking on the Andrew Marr show, the Transport Secretary said the crisis is nothing new.

Meanwhile, the French outfit Teleperformance Ltd was given £million for a similar service. And HH Associates has been awarded £million to print certicates and send them to people unable to print their own or use online services. Covid passes are widespread in some countries but in the UK have only been used at limited events and for foreign travel. Vaccine passports in nightclubs and other indoor venues were due to be mandatory at the end of this month, but Mr Javid ditched the plan. He said in a TV interview: We looked at it properly and we keep it in reserve as an option but I am pleased to say we will not be going ahead with plans.  Other contracts include £.million to design a Covid Pass with IT firm Cognizant Worldwide, and deals to provide IT services worth more than £million with Akamai Technologies and Entrust Europe.A Department of Health spokesperson said: The NHS COVID Pass is an important part of international travel – usable in  countries – and remains an essential part of plans to keep certication as an option of last resort.Wales is still deciding on the passports.

That is despite  of those fleeing the Taliban to other countries being accepted for settlement in Britain. The revelation by Armed Forces minister James Heappey angered shadow Defence Secretary John Healey. He said: “Ministers were utterly unprepared for the Afghan withdrawal and Taliban take-over. We’re failing those who risked their lives “Ministers must strike agreements with nearby countries, so they can get safe haven then safe passage to the UK.” The evacuation from Kabul known as Operation Pitting succeeded in getting , British helpers and their families out of Afghanistan under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy or ARAP designed for them. But many are still stranded in nearby countries Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan while others were left in Germany after scrambling aboard US evacuation flights.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said some have even made it as far as Australia. And Foreign Office teams have been sent to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to help people stuck there. He added: “The scheme will continue to operate to bring people back to the UK for however many are eligible and however long it takes.” But of the , Afghans who applied for ARAP , were rejected.  And , including relatives who were granted the right to live in Britain were left behind in Afghanistan when the airlt came to an abrupt end. They were put in danger last week when an MoD official accidently copied them all into an email. The official has now been suspended and a probe into the cock-up launched. Tory MP and Afghanistan veteran Johnny Mercer said he can only account for the whereabouts of  of the , interpreters who worked for British forces between -. The MoD has now made  service married quarters available to rescued refugees and is now looking for more.

Following talks late into the evening, however, Labour’s leader agreed a new package of reforms which were backed by the party’s ruling National Executive Committee on Saturday lunchtime. The ruling body voted  to  in favour, a source said. The new changes will now be put to a showdown vote on the Labour Party conference floor on Sunday afternoon. Perhaps the most controversial will be a higher nomination bar to become a leadership candidate. Candidates will now need the backing of % of MPs, or  on current numbers. Currently the threshold is % of MPs, plus % of CLPs and % of affiliates. Originally Sir Keir’s team proposed %. Jeremy Corbyn only just managed to reach a previous % MP threshold with moments to spare in . The changes will also ditch the registered supporters scheme, which allowed people who paid a small fee and signed a declaration of support to vote in leadership elections. The NEC also backed proposals to raise the bar for which MPs can face a deselection threat. Currently,either a third of members or a third of affiliates want to block their MPsapos candidacy at the next general election, a race can be triggered. The leader’s team wants to raise the bar for a selection challenge to half of both members and trade unions affiliates.  Finally the NEC backed a move to cut the number of grassroots conference motions debated at the partyaposs annual gathering each year. Only six plus six motions will be able to be put forward, rather than  plus , under the proposed changes. Keir Starmer said in a statement: “I’m very pleased these party reforms have got the backing of our NEC. These proposals put us in a better position to win the next general election and I hope constituency and trade union delegates will support them when they come to conference floor” The new set of reforms are still likely to be highly controversial with the Left - and will put be put to conference delegates who are meeting in Brighton from today until Wednesday. It has been a dficult start to the Leaderaposs first in-person conference since he was elected Corbynaposs successor. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner, who is said to have been sceptical about ing the party to the electoral college system, is due to speak at pm. This afternoon delegates will vote on whether to confirm Starmeraposs appointment of David Evans as general secretary, which may be a flashpoint with the Left following a programme of cuts.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jeremy CorbynNEC CorporationLabour PartyEducationSchoolsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One way or another. In a few days the Labour leader will have secured his position as the true hope of an alternative to the Tories for a better Britain. Or he will have cemented his place in the public mind as that serious, nice man who’ll never make it to be PM. The stakes could not be higher as Labour meets in Brighton for a ­conference that is both showcase and battlefield. An opportunity for Keir to shine a light on the man the public has yet to connect with, on his policies and on his vision for the future. But played out against a calculated gladiatorial clash with the unions and the left.  The unheralded emergence of plans for a major shake-up of the party power structure dismayed many in advance of a gathering that was supposed to be all about unity. But Keir is determined to grandstand the extinction of any remnants of Corbynism, whose passion still flickers in the embers of the party’s worst ­election defeat in its history. The risk is that the look is same old warring Labour. But the boys and girls in the backroom strategy office decided a stand-up fight was good box office. Here’s one: “Not all internal conflict is electoral bad news…it can strengthen a leader. If they lose but show the will to fight, their courage can inspire the party and the electorate.” Stand by to be inspired.  The first live mass gathering of the party since the lawyer son of a toolmaker and nurse won the top job  long months ago, it has been billed as a chance to prove the party is still a ­credible choice for voters at the next election. Indeed, it could be a tipping point. Like the climate change that will ­determine the weather on the seafront outside the conference hall, the point of nois dangerously close for Labour. Similarly, all the indicators are scarily obvious. Against the worst, morally Teflon-coated PM in living memory, Labour lags behind in the polls. As Boris Johnson’s ham-fisted, ideologically twisted Government tears the sinews of civilised le apart, Keir needs to brandish a big idea that will turn the electoral tide. It is delusional to imagine the inevitable bursting of Boris’s balloon will automatically transfer into electoral success for Labour. Policies have been rolled out, open goal screamers have hit the back of the Commons net. But few have noticed and few have been convinced. Too many share the feeling, as one member on their way to the seaside put it, that “Keir doesn’t even seem to know where the ball is”. Critics detect more than a whf of Blairism revisited in attacks on the left. Yet even the high priest of New Labour, Lord Mandelson, calls for a “more radical” message. Something perhaps with a bit more high-velocity impact than a -page pamphlet on political motherhood and apple pie. The good news is that Keir faces an electorate showing signs of wanting to listen, willing to be convinced. It’s a chance he can’t afford to flunk. As he said in a message to delegates: “We can only create a successful, modern Britainwe seize this moment.” No pressure, Keir.

As Labour conference began in Brighton, Ms Reeves told The Sunday Times: “I don’t have any plans to increase the rates of income tax. But she added: “I do think that people who get their income through wealth should have to pay more.” Mr Starmer appeared to slap down his colleague, telling the BBC: We are looking at tax - nothing is off the table, but we donapost know what the state of the national finances will be as we go to the election.  What Rachel Reeves said is sheaposs not currently considering income tax and that is fine, but what Iaposm saying is as we go into the election we will apply the principles we have set out to the situation as it arises. What we donapost want to do - whether itaposs income tax or any other sort of tax, national insurance - is unfairly to hit working families, which is what this Government is doing. Mr Starmer would not say whether he was considering a wealth tax. He said: Look at the choice the Government is making - under their provision, under their tax they announced the other week, those with many properties as landlords donapost pay a penny more, their working tenants do. It comes as party faithful gathered in Brighton for Labouraposs first in-person conference since . Mr Starmer is under pressure to outline his vision for Labour after nearly  months at the helm, with all eyes on his big speech on Wednesday. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, he said Labour would scrap the charitable status of private schools to claw back £. billion for the state sector.He also told the BBC that Labour would not nationalise the biggest energy firms, in a major departure from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn.Askedhe would nationalise the Big Six energy companies, he said: No. He was shown his  leadership campaign pledges, one of which states that public services should be in public hands and that he would support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water. I donapost see nationalisation there, he said. When it comes to common ownership Iaposm pragmatic about this. I do not agree with the argument that says we must be ideological. He did not say what form common ownership would takeit was not nationalisation.

The Labour leader distanced himself from his predecessor Jeremy Corbynaposs manesto plan to nationalise the energy sector - in a move likely to anger the left wing of the party.And he appeared to ditch his  leadership pledge to support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water.

Iaposd be pragmatic about it, and where common ownership is value for money for the taxpayer and delivers better services then there should be common ownership, he added. He pointed to the much-criticised Test and Trace system, which Labour would like to see under public ownership. Shadow Energy Secretary Ed Miliband insisted earlier this that Labour was committed to public ownership to make the transition to green energy. “Wait for the conference, but Keir Starmer said in his leadership campaign he was in favour of public ownership in those areas. We haven’t changed that commitment, he told BBC Newsnight. He added: If we’re going to make this green transition, then public ownership is the right way to go. We don’t resile from those commitments.” Delegates at conference backed a motion for a socialist green new deal - which included a commitment to nationalise energy firms. The motion was promoted by the Fire Brigades Union and the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association , along with campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal. Chris Saltmarsh, co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, said Mr Starmer was alienating himself from ordinary members and urged him toto his leadership pledges. He said: This result shows that there is huge support for a radical agenda in the Labour Party, and that the membership and affiliated unions are united in their support for transformative politics.Starmer should recognise this, re-state the ambitious pledges of his leadership campaign, and put the Green New Deal at the heart of his leadership. GMB union proposed a less radical motion, with support for public and alternative forms of ownership. A show of hards was too close to call but the motion was passed by nearly % in favour by card vote, according to LabourList. Gary Smith, GMB General Secretary, said: “We support a Green New Deal but it can’t be based on running down industries and making tens of thousands redundant – that’s not how you take workers and their communities with you.

The Labour leader suggested Rosie Duffield’s comment that “only women have a cervix” was “not right”, and it does “everybody a disservice” to reduce the debate to single comments like hers. Sir Keir said the MP, who said she had received advice that her security could be at risk at the Brighton gathering, should be welcome to attend safely. But he suggested she should not have made her comment, adding: “The trans community are as I say, the most marginalised and abused of many.” His view that she should not make the comment prompted an immediate furious backlash on social media. And Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said: But it is right Keir. Only women have a cervix. But carry on. We Conservatives will be laughing all the way to the ballot box. Canterbury MP Ms Duffield told The Sunday Times she feared LGBT rights activists would “have a massive go at me” over her views, including a  tweet in which she said “only women have a cervix”. She said she was “exhausted” and at times “frightened”, adding: “We have had Labour MPs who have had to have security at conference over the past few years, and I didnapost want that sort of attention or to become the story.“I just thought it was better for everyoneI quietly stayed away. It is part of a bitter dispute between trans women who ask society to honour their wish to be described as women, and some feminists who say the term should be reserved for those who were born biologically female. Ms Duffield posted in August : “I’m a apostransphobeapos for knowing that only women have a cervix…. !”She also ‘liked’ a Twitter post which said “heterosexuals cosplaying as the opposite sex and as ‘gay’” were reclaiming the word “queer”. Cosplaying is a term for dressing up and the remarks were branded “extremely homophobic and transphobic” by LGBT+ Labour. Two of Ms Duffield’s staff members quit last year over her views and LGBT+ Labour demanded she have the whip suspended. Her comments to the Sunday Times also prompted a fierce debate within the party, with some MPs exasperated that the issue was gaining traction instead of Labour policy.Asked“someone who thinks only women have a cervix is welcome in the Labour Party”, Keir Starmer told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “Look, we need to have a mature respectful debate about trans rights.“And we need to I think bear in mind that the trans community is amongst the most marginalised, abused communities and wherever we’ve got to in the law we need to go further. “And we want to go further on that. But whatever the debate is, it needs to be a tolerant debate and I’m absolutely sure out conference will be a place that is safe for that debate to take place, and it is.” Askedit is transphobic to say only women have a cervix, Sir Keir replied: “It is something that shouldn’t be said, it is not right, but I don’t think that -“ Asked why Rosie Duffield should not have said that, he replied: “I don’t think that we can just go through ious things that people have said. I spoke to Rosie earlier this week and told her conference was a safe place for her to come and it is a safe place for her to come, and I spoke to others to make exactly the same principle. “We do everybody a disservice when we reduce what is a really important issue to these exchanges on particular things that are said. The trans community are as I say, the most marginalised and abused of many many communities and we need to make progress on the Gender Recognition Act.” He added: “I am very concerned that this debate needs to be conducted in a proper way in which proper views are expressed in a way that is respectful.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Labour PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And nothing is more important to children than their future. So Keir Starmer is right to pledge an education revolution to ensure a future fair to all. It cannot be fair that children from poorer backgrounds lag  months behind their wealthier peers at GCSE level – simply because parents can afford to pay fees.So it is only right the VAT and business rate exemptions private schools enjoy through charitable status be abolished. The £.billion that would bring in would be erted to state schools in desperate need of the money.This newspaper believes in free choice – and that includes the freedom for people to choose how they spend their money. But the taxpayer should not have to subsidise that choice. Nor should some children miss out because their privileged peers have it all. In the computer-reliant st Century, every child should have a laptop at home. That is what this money will provide. Careers advice is not just for privileged children. This extra money will pay for that valuable guidance in the state sector too. But none of this can happen unless Sir Keir becomes Prime Minister, which is why Labour’s conference in Brighton this week is so crucial. We accept that until now the Labour leader has been hamstrung by the pandemic. For the first year of his leadership, he was unable to shake hands with a single voter. And this week is his first opportunity to address the party faithful face to face.  But despite those handicaps, his critics continue to carp. They accuse him of failing to inspire, of having no policies and of a lack of vision and direction. These are all points Sir Keir must address in his conference speech. And from what we have seen of it so far, it will be a barnstormer. Labour is now awash with policies, from tackling climate change to dealing with the catastrophe of Universal Credit. And as our exclusive interview with him today shows, Sir Keir has direction and his vision is  . Now he must also prove that he can inspire people, so Labour activists leave Brighton with a spring in their step and Labour’s feet firmly set on the road to No. That is a more dficult task for a man who is not naturally flamboyant. And Sir Keir is beset by the some of the same dficulties previous leaders wrestled with, among them Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair – namely those posed by the hard left. But the socialist revolution promised by Jeremy Corbyn was rejected in two elections. And had Labour persisted, it would simply have been rejected in a third. The Tory Party in power today is without principles. Labour has principles aplenty – but principles without power to implement them are just so much well-meaning waffle. Sir Keir has all the decency and determination to change the lives of British people for the better. This week he must show why he is the right man to do it.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyPoliticsKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Have a story to tell The good news is Labour is a party rooted in strong values. The bad news is they have few policies on which to hang those values. Nobody is expecting the party to produce a fully-costed manesto this far out from a general election. But voters would like a taster of what Labour would do in power.Until Keir Starmer has something to say he will remain vulnerable to the Tory attack that he is carping on the sidelines while they get on with the business of government.The Labour leader urgently needs a story to tell of how his party will improve people’s lives and transform the fortunes of the country. Be more nimble Opposition is hard. It is especially demoralising when you are up against a party with an -seat majority. All opposition parties face the same Catch-: you cannot get a fair hearing because people are sceptical you can win power but you cannot win power unless you get a fair hearing. Labour needs to be quicker to seize the few opportunities it gets. When major news events occur, such as the energy crisis, then it should be on the front foot saying how they would do things dferently. Lead, don’t follow. Be more welcoming At some point Labour forgot the basic rule of politics - to gain power you need to win people over to your side. That means welcoming people with whom you may disagree, including Tory voters. Fairly or unfairly the perception of Labour is of a party that has become a haven for the self-righteous, the worthy and the woke rather than an organisation that represents all sections of society. The party has been better at preaching than reaching out. It needs to starting building bridges so former voters can feel comfortable ing to the party. Regain trust Obviously, this is easier said than done. In some areas, such as health and education, Labour is still trusted by the voters but in others, notably the economy and immigration, they have lost the confidence of the public. There has been some progress since Starmer became leader but more must be done to prove that Labour can once again be trusted with the country’s finances.  Stop fighting internal battles Labour has always been a broad church. When in power this can be something to celebrate but in opposition this can be a liability. In recent years the congregation has spent more time engaged in feuds and bloodletting than in singing with one voice. Rather than seeking converts, they have preferred to hunt dissenters. Instead of attacking the Tories, they have spent more time attacking each other. Those who called for unity under previous leaderships may wish to start practising what they used to preach. Broaden the palate If the Labour Party does not stand up for the vulnerable, the poorest and the voiceless then it has no purpose. As Harold Wilson said, Labour is a moral crusade or it is nothing. It is right that the opposition holds the Government to account on poverty and social security. But Labour cannot be seen as exclusively as the party of welfare and the NHS. Issues such as the technological revolution, the changing face of work, and law and order also matter to voters yet Labour has so far had little to say on these subjects.  You cannot please everyone Yes, elections are won by those parties with the broadest appeal but you have to realise you cannot please everyone. Voters have an instinctive ability to tell when a politician is saying something for the sake of it rather than because they believe it. Certain sections of the public may not always agree with you but they have more respect for someone who sticks to their beliefs than someone who tries to pretend they are something they are not.Labour’s contortions over Brexit demonstrated there is much to be lost and little to be gained by trying to sit on the fence.Remind people of your record Labour governments can make a dference. In power Labour introduced the Equal PayAct, Sure Start, the Equality Act, the national minimum wage and Sex Discrimination Act . If you spend your time trashing your record in government don’t be surprisedvoters start to share that opinion. If you take pride in what you achieved then voters will be reminded of why they once voted for you.  Rediscover aspiration The former leader of the Transport and General Workers Union Ron Todd once said: “What do you say to a docker who earns £ a week, owns his house, a new car, a microwave and a video, as well as a small place near Marbella  You do not say ‘let me take you out of your misery, brother’.” Labour has a great story to tell on aspiration, it just forgets to say it. The party needs to remind people how its policies have helped lt people out of poverty, given them an education and opened doors they thought were closed. Unite the Kingdom If the Tories insist on playing the isive card, Labour needs to deal the unity one. The vast majority of Britons are fed up with culture wars, arguments over Brexit and the constant attempts to play off one part of society against another. The temptation is engage with the Conservative games. A better strategy would be to present yourselves as unying force that can heal the wounds the Tories have opened.

As ever, the event will be a battleground between the partyaposs dferent factions over what the party does next. But it will also be packed with barnstorming speeches from shadow ministers, rallies and lively political debate. Before the conference gets underway, Starmer faces a battle to get a string of controversial rule changes past trade union leaders and the partyaposs ruling National Executive Committee. He hopes to stamp his authority on the party by changing leadership rules, cutting the number of conference motions and raising the threshold by which MPs can face a deselection threat, but his proposals face fierce opposition.

Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, which is campaigning for Fair Care for All, she said: “I have seen that the collective voice improves not just the standards for workers but improves the level of care and the service that people get. “I was really passionate about it when I was a home carer.” Boris Johnson famously declared on his first day as PM in July  that “I am announcing now, on the steps of Downing Street, that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve” - before waiting  months to publish it.Ms Rayner, the party’s Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work, signalled Labour’s plan would be brought to Parliament less than three weeks after the party s to office. “Within the days of the next Labour Government .. the first thing I’m going to say, when Keir’s Prime Minister, is ‘Right, this is what my driving goal as Deputy Prime Minister is - to drive this Employment Rights Bill right the way through so we can deliver that immediately’,” she revealed. Under Labour’s plan for Fair Pay Agreements, workers’ leaders and bosses would “be brought together by the Government to establish and agree minimum pay, terms and conditions which will be binding on all employers and workers in the sector”, the party said.  It added: “The Fair Pay Agreement would then form a ‘floor’ in a sector, preventing exploitative employers from undercutting the many good employers.”Ms Rayner blasted the right-wing caricature of collective bargaining, saying people think it “is about Punch ‘n’ Judy, the management versus the staff and the union”.Recalling how she fought for better conditions when she was a union rep, she added: “Actually we worked collaboratively to have a programme called Delivering the Workforce which meant that the girls that worked in home care - and they were predominantly women then - had a career path, they had a skills training set. “The staff retention was amazing, staff sickness levels went down, therefore the employers saved money, the service was improved and the workers had better work le balance and better terms and conditions. “I see collective bargaining as a win-win.” Ms Rayner said care work could be “incredibly rewarding but it can be demoralisingyou don’t get the time and the training to do the job properly”. “You feel it personally,” she said. Fair Pay Agreements would begin in the care sector but eventually be rolled out to other sectors. “I think every industry should look at it,” said Ms Rayner. They would work alongside existing pay agreements and legal minimums, such as the £-an-hour minimum wage which Labour pledges for all workers. In contrast, the Governmentaposs “national living wage” – the rebranded minimum – is £. an hour and only paid to workers aged  and over.  Hourly minimum pay for under-s is £. the rate for workers aged  to  is £. and the minimum for those aged  and  is £.. Sipping tea at Powell’s Eats in South East London, where the words “Good Hope” are spelt on the wall, Ms Rayner, , expanded on her plan to overhaul workers’ rights. Labour’s shake-up would “not only deliver for workers, which I think is crucial … it’s also good for our economy and local economies,” she said. “We are in a cafe now - local people will be using this cafe. If they havenapost got any money, they won’t be coming here. “It cross-pollinates other businesses and other sectors, so it’s an important part of our programme to make being a worker in Britain a much more pleasurable experience. “People go to work to live - they don’t live for work. “People should be able to have dignity and respect at work and, by empowering employees, it actually gives employers more. “The best employers we’ve got know that and do this already.” Labour activists head to Brighton on Saturday for their annual party conference - their first big face-to-face gathering for two years.The  edition was shelved because of coronavirus, with Keir Starmer delivering his maiden speech as leader to a deserted room while standing in front of a brick wall in Doncaster.Sunshine and C temperatures are forecast for the south coast - and Angela Rayner is looking forward to the long-awaited reunion. “Covid was really dficult for a hell of a lot of people and I don’t think anyone was not affected,” she said. “I felt, when I was elected deputy leader, that my wings were clipped because ~I felt the frustration of not being able to engage and get out there. “I think Keir also expressed that - he’d only ever spoken down the lens of a camera and never actually done a speech to people. “Iaposm really looking forward to being out there. “It’s going to be really good to get out there and put our vision forward.” Trumpeting her speech, she added: “I’m starting conference on a very meaty footing - this is not a vegetarian dish, this has got plenty of meat in it.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyUnisonBoris JohnsonMinimum wagePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The EG Group said in a statement that the move was intended to ensure everyone would have a “fair chance to refuel” and to enable sites to carry on smoothly, Manchester Evening News reports.The £ limit will not apply to emergency services and lorry drivers because of their “vital role”, the company said. The announcement comes as the government looks into introducing temporary measures to tackle the shortage of HGV drivers that has signicantly impacted a number of industries. Boris Johnson is reportedly considering relaxing UK immigration rules to allow more foreign drivers into the country, although No  insisted any measures would be “very strictly time-limited”.Up to , temporary visas could be granted for HGV drivers, according to the Financial Times and the , as authorities scramble to tackle the problem of empty supermarket shelves and closed petrol stations.Esso, BP and Tesco forecourts have been affected by challenges getting petrol deliveries. BP said that around  or its , forecourts were closed due to a lack of available fuel, and between  and  sites have been affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel. Esso owner ExxonMobil said a “small number” of Tesco refilling stations have also been impacted. In a statement published by the EG group, a spokesperson said: “Due to the current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges we have taken the decision to introduce a limit of £ per customer on all of our grades of fuel. This excludes HGV drivers and emergency services due to their vital role at this time. “This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly. We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times.  All of EG Group’s UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged drivers not to panic buy petrol, amid chaotic scenes at petrol stations across the country. Speaking to Sky News on Friday, he said that motorists should “carry on as normal”. Meanwhile, a survey by the Office for National Statisticsfound that around one in six adults in Britain said they were not able to buy essential food items at some point during the past two weeks, due to products not being available. A Downing Street spokesman said: We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages. But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country. Weaposre looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time-limited. We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience.

His comments had targeted Labour party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds. The conference is held next-door to the Grand Hotel, where an IRA bomb during the Tories’  conference killed five people. According to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Gray replied to a comment on a WhatsApp group from fellow Conservative MP Rob Largan. Mr Largan had said: “Does anybody know where Anneliese Doddsapos Commons office is based  I need to deliver something to her office.”  Mr Gray replied: “A bomb, perhaps ” After being contacted by the Mirror, Mr Gray confirmed he made the remarks saying: “This was a foolish remark made on a private What’s App and deleted almost immediately. “I meant no offence of any kind, and hope none was taken.” Ms Dodds said in a statement: “I think it’s important that he apologises. “I would say that the broader issue of safety for everyone in politics is very important. “I think all parliamentarians should be committed to ensuring that everyone can be involved in public le without any fear of intimidation or violence.” The comments emerged at the same time as Conservatives voiced outcry at Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, calling Tories “scum”. Ms Rayner said at an event for Labour members: I’m sick of shouting from the sidelines and I bet youse lot are as well. We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile [inaudible] Banana Republic, vile, nasty, Etonian [inaudible] piece of scum.” To applause, she added she had held back a little. Tory minister Amanda Milling said the Labour MPaposs remarks were shocking, adding: Angela Rayner must apologise. She said Ms Rayner had been former leader Jeremy Corbynaposs henchman when Labour became embroiled in anti-Semitism and she failed to act. Fellow Foreign Office minister James Cleverly accused Ms Rayner of talking crap. He said: Iaposm sure this went down well in the room but when voters look at the party that has had both female PMs, with half of the great offices of state filled by women, half by BAME, most erse government, more gay ministers than Labour ever had etc. Ms Rayner refused to back down when quizzed on her comments today. She told Sky News: I am not saying that anyone who voted for the Conservatives are racist, scummy and homophobic… I’m saying the Prime Minister has said those things and acted in that way. If the Prime Minister wants to apologise and remove himself from those comments he’s made that are homophobic, racist and misogynistic then I will apologise for calling him scummy.

And we have already had , Pfizer jabs from Covax, the global organisation which boasts that it “bridges the vaccine ide regardless of wealth.” Consumer minister Paul Scully revealed that although we have sourced enough doses to double-vaccinate the entire population three times over we have spent £million to take even more from Covax. He said: “This gives us the option to buy vaccines for up to % of the UK population.” Yet he also admitted the UK has so far only donated  million doses “to those countries most in need.” That has infuriated MPs who say the priority should be getting vaccine to poorer nations which do not have enough. Shadow International Development Secretary Preet Kaur Gill said: “This is not only morally reprehensible but also leaves us all less safe. “The Government needs to act now to donate excess vaccines and push the rest of the international community to do the same.” And Lib Dem Layla Moran, chair of the all party Coronavirus Group, added: “It’s outrageous to learn they have taken vaccines earmarked for some of the poorest people in the world.“The Government must make amends by implementing a one-in-one-out policy for international vaccine donation to stop new iants emerging and save lives abroad.” She said that Britain should ensure the rest of the world is vaccinated before giving third booster jabs to healthy over-s here. Only two per cent of populations in the world’s poorest countries have received a first dose of vaccine and Britain has donated only six per cent of the vaccines promised.Instead Boris Johnson boasts we have given money rather than vaccine - £million to Covax to help pay for its worldwide programme. Ms Moran added: “Vaccinating the world is the only way we can reduce the risk of future, more deadly iants entering the UK.” The PM did a deal with Covax along with other rich countries to pool investments in exchange for early access to vaccines in case other deliveries did not work out. Covax expects to be  million doses short of their target for poorer countries this year and has already cut supplies to Africa by  million. And the , doses from Covax the UK received in June was more than double the amount sent that month to the entire African continent. Yet even after booster shots and jabs for  -  year olds have been rolled out Britain will still have  million doses of the vaccine left over. And their use-by dates are likely to expire before they can be sent anywhere .

A temporary visa scheme will see opportunities created for , HGV drivers and , poultry workers to take up employment in the UK until Christmas Eve. The move has been taken in a bid to keep supermarket shelves stocked with turkeys and toys as well as counter delivery dficulties at petrol stations. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes, with the visas available from next month, would ensure preparations remain on track for the festive season. Retailers had warned the Government that it had just  days to save Christmas from signicant disruption due to a shortfall of about , drivers in the freight sector.  Meanwhile military HGV test examiners are being drafted in to get , British truckers onto UK roads. The plan is to have more recruits trained to drive lorries over the next  weeks in time for Christmas to plug the HGV driver shortage which has left supermarket shelves bare. But Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium said it was not enough. He added: “The limit of , visas will do little to alleviate the current shortfall. “Supermarkets estimate they need at least , HGV drivers for their businesses to be able to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas.” A million letters are also going out to all drivers who currently hold an HGV licence encouraging them back into the industry. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned hauliers yesterday this is a short-term fix and they must not rely on overseas labour. He said: “We are acting now but the industries must also play their part with salary increases to retain new drivers.”  Environment Secretary George Eustice added: “We are acting to alleviate what is a very tight labour market.” The visa scheme is also to be extended to , foreign poultry workers so shoppers can get their turkeys in time for Christmas. The Department for Education is joining the big recruitment drive with a £million scheme for Skills Bootcamps to train , of the drivers while the other , will take local adult education courses. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “We are taking action to tackle the shortage of drivers by removing barriers to help more people to launch new careers.” The three emergency services and the MoD will conduct driving tests for one another to free up other examiners. Food and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright said: “This is something UK food and drink manufacturers have asked for over the last few months. “This is a start but we need the Government to collaborate with industry and seek long term solutions.” Comment MORE ON Ministry of DefenceBritish Retail ConsortiumIan WrightBoris JohnsonNadhim ZahawiGrant ShappsEducationPoliticsSupermarketsSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

EVCL Chill, which delivers chilled food to the supermarket giants, has been put into administration amid a shortage of truck drivers. A shortage of HGV drivers and the loss o customers during the pandemic has affected the company according to administrators PWC. Almost , lorry drivers from Europe are being allowed into the UK to help ease the haulage crisis.Prime Minister Boris Johnson aposs wants military driving examiners brought in to boost the number of HGV tests to allow more British drivers can get on the road.There is an estimated shortage of about , HGV drivers, exacerbated by the pandemic and Brexit the Road Haulage Association says.Fuel delivery supplies have been badly hit in the last few days sparking violence at forecourts among motorists.

Up to  jobs are at threat at the companyaposs bases in Daventry and Crick in Northamptonshire, Alfreton in Derbyshire, Rochdale in Greater Manchester, Bristol, and Penrith in Cumbria.

The adminstrator said staff whose jobs havenapost been transferred to other firms would hear more about their jobs next week. The collapse of EVCL Chill comes ahead of an expected government announcement which will allow the relaxation of Visa rules visa rules for foreign HGV drivers to sopped up supply chains.  Tony Danker, director general of the Confederation of British Industry , called for a temporary and managed system to bring in foreign workers.

Barratt chief David Thomas, , picked up £.million in bonuses on top of his £, pay, the company’s annual report reveals. It takes the keen fisherman’s pay and perks tally to £million since starting as CEO in . Yet leaseholders in Barratt homes face paying out tens of thousands to fix defects in the wake of the Grenfell fire which killed  in West London in . IT worker Steve Day, , got a £, bill to replace flammable cladding on his Barratt build at Royal Artillery Quays in Greenwich, South East London. He said: “These huge payouts are a kick in the teeth when so many leaseholders are staring down the barrel at financial ruin.”  Steve is among leaseholders liable for a £million repair bill. Barratt – with £million pre-tax profits in the year to June – is covering £million-worth. Dave Richards, from End Our Cladding Scandal, said: “Remedial funds set aside by Barratt are nowhere near enough. To rub salt into leaseholders’ wounds, David Thomas is paid huge sums running a company which is failing many customers. We speak regularly with Barratt leaseholders. Some face bankruptcy, others are delaying families, pensioners are going back to work to pay for the repairs. “All tell us they feel completely trapped. It is high time Barratt did the right thing by finally making homes safe.” Barratt has generated pre-tax profits of £billion since Grenfell – paying out £.billion to shareholders. Married Mr Thomas lives on a £.million estate in Purley, South London. Papers show his £.million included a £.million bonus and £.million performance share payout. He also got £.million in  and £.million last year. The firm says cladding at Royal Artillery met regulations at the time. A spokesman said: “We don’t think leaseholders should pay for remediation and we are helping building owners to find solutions to support leaseholders in buildings we built. “We have set aside or spent £million and will update this amount as work progresses and reviews are completed.” Comment MORE ON BarrattDavid ThomasSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The concept stems from the age-old ‘time is money’. And exploring that idea throws up the issue of dferentiating between our needs and our wants.A blog by Squirrelers, looks at the idea of aposhow many hours did I work to buy an item apos Itaposs something weaposve likely all looked at, but the method is more powerful than you may think.In this blog, the example talks about a car costing around ,, and the person who purchased it had a salary of , per year.

This meant that they would need to work , hours to get the car, and when taking into account that the calculation above assumes , working hours per year, this comes out to . years of their le that they have worked just to pay off a car. Pretty crazy when you think about it, right  The blogger also explained that even from a young age, he would work out the cost of cinema tickets. He said: “When I realized that for me to spend  to see a . hour movie and enjoy popcorn and a soda, it would take me that long at work just to do that. “It got me thinking about how maybe I didn’t need to get the popcorn and soda, and maybe should just get one or the other.”Maths-Whizz is a super clever virtual maths tutor which delivers interactive games, lessons and exercises for five to  year olds.To see how good it is at transforming home learning for parents, weaposve negotiated an exclusive % off price to make it £. for the first month.Seeyou like it first and sign up to a -day no-obligation free trial by clicking here.

His stepdad said the war veteran questioned whether the sacrice by thousands of British troops was worth itLuke Monckton at his passing out parade with parents Dave and AudraBySean Rayment:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep The family of an Afghanistan war veteran who took his own le say their son was deeply troubled by the country’s ­recent fall to the Taliban. Former Royal Engineer Luke Monckton, a dad of five, killed himself just days after the insurgents seized back control last month. His stepdad David Savory, also an Army veteran, said Luke questioned whether the sacrice by ­thousands of British troops killed and wounded in the -year war was worth it. Dave told the Sunday People: “The fall of the country to the Taliban deeply affected Luke. Just days before he died he said to his mum and me, “Why did we bother  It was a waste of le.’ I could tell it was something that troubled him.”  Luke, , is believed to be among eight veterans to have committed suicide – three of them last week – following the US-led withdrawal from the country and he is the first of them to be named. He is also thought to be the st Army suicide this year. The family suspects Luke, who died on August , was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder – made worse because family friend Connor Ray, also in the Royal Engineers, had been killed in Afghanistan in . Luke, from Boorley Green, Hants, joined the Army aged  in  and served as a sapper for about eight years in the Royal Engineers. In , he deployed to Afghanistan and was responsible for building ­forward operating bases, often in ­isolated Taliban-controlled areas. The work was dangerous and ­dficult and most days, Luke and his comrades came under fire.  Dave, , who was in the Royal Green Jackets for  years, said: “Luke loved the Army and didn’t really want to leave. “But the Army was having a big impact on his family le. He had missed the births of two of his first three children and he said that he wanted to be more of a dad, which is why he left. “But he missed Army le. He tried to rejoin a couple of years ago but there was a waiting list. “He became a HGV driver and went to work in the Co-op. He was ­doing well. He had a good salary, a nice home and a lovely family.” But Luke was a changed person when he ed from Afghanistan.  Dave said: “He never really spoke about what happened. He was essentially a closed book on that. “I know that he was under fire a lot of the time and the events which took place out there had a deep impact on him. But like a lot of veterans he kept a lot of what happened to himself. “He did have problems when he came home, he couldn’t settle very well and he struggled with his demons. Looking back, he was probably suffering from PTSD. Anything which might make somebody a little fed-up would leave him very, very down. He refused therapy and just wanted to get on.” Luke – father to Jenson, , Jared, , Hallie, five, Harleigh, four, and Jacob, two – was separated from his we at the time of his death and sharing a flat with his older brother, Adam. He was found by Adam, mum Audra and Dave. They tried to resuscitate him but he was already dead. Dave said: “The effect on us has been devastating. We have ­decided to speak publicly about this because we don’t want anyone  to go through what we have been through. We knew Luke was feeling a bit low but had no idea that he might take his own le.” Family friend Helen Mcilfatrick, , of New Brighton, Merseyside, said: “Luke was very proud of his ­service but the way veterans are treated by the Government is disgusting. He was clearly suffering.” Helen set up a Just Giving page and hopes to raise £, to help Luke’s family with funeral costs.  Following the Sunday People Save Our Soldiers campaign, the Ministry of Defence has announced it will start recording veteran suicides. But former Army warrant officer Jim Wilde of the pressure group Veterans United Against Suicide warned it was just a single step in the right direction. He said: “There needs to be liaison with the very people directly affected – veterans.”The shambolic pull-out from Afghanistan – which US President Joe Biden insisted on sticking to despite Afghan troops being overrun by the Taliban – is feared to have triggered the new wave of suicides.Former Veterans’ minister Johnny Mercer MP, who served in Afghanistan, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with those families who have been bereaved last week. The truth is that the debacle of leaving Afghanistan has proved extremely dficult for many of us who actually fought there. I did manage to establish Op COURAGE during my time as Minister, which should be pulling together all NHS mental health services. “I would urge fellow veterans finding these days and nights tough to reach out to them.” A Government spokesperson said: “Every suicide is a tragedy and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Luke Monckton at this dficult time. “Veterans can access specialist ­support from Op COURAGE. “We announced a new reporting method for veteran suicides in England and Wales to further understand where there is need for dedicated services.” To help Luke’s family, go to justgiving crowdfunding lukemonckton* If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Since then, he has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and is also a carer for his partner, , who has visual impairment, and their three-year-old daughter Amelia.Are you worried about the Universal Credit cut  Get in touch at webnews@mirror The couple are now trying to juggle their household budget to make sure they have enough money put by to heat their home and put food on the table, as well as try to give their daughter a good Christmas. He said the uplt meant they could provide extra activities with their daughter while her nursery was closed, and provided an extra security blanket as they endured lockdown. He said: It just enabled us not to worry too much about the bills, it took the pressure off. Now we are going to be £ a month worse off. Are we still going to be able to do the things we want to do with Amelia, and heat our home, especially with the energy crisis going on  Are we going to be able to get the food we need, and pay the bills, especially with the winter coming  It certainly is a worry, and I hope it doesnapost get to that. My partner is writing lists and making sure we save enough money to pay for this bill and that bill, and have enough money for food and Christmas. More than a third of the almost six million people on Universal Credit nationally are in work. The system was rolled out by the government to replace a series of other benefits, bringing together support for income with housing and childcare costs into a single payment.The £ a week uplt was brought in at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in  for a year and was extended in March this year, but is due to end by October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shown no signs of reversing plans for the £ reduction, suggesting it could only be keptpaid for by tax hikes.In comments made during his US trip, he said he had “every sympathy” for those toughing it out on benefits, but that the £- billion required to make the additional weekly payments permanent would have to “come out of some people’s pockets”. The government has said the uplt was always meant to be temporary, and one minister said the reduction equalled two hoursapos work for those in employment.The cut also comes as Boris Johnson refused to say whether he could live on the usual Universal Credit payment. The Prime Minister was askedhe could get by on just £ a week - the standard UC allowance for a couple over  after UC is slashed next month. It came as he again snubbed calls to maintain the £-a-week rise for six million of the poorest families - despite mounting warnings of looming hardship and poverty.

It has issued a nine-point plan including demanding the reintroduction of mandatory mask wearing indoors, more financial support for people to self isolate and the right to work from home where possible for all workers.

His dad, Abubaker, told LeicestershireLive: We thought he was just unwell, we didnapost think it had anything to do with his skin.But as his condition worsened, his parents called an ambulance and later discovered his skin had developed an infectionHe was diagnosed with erythroderma, a potentially fatal severe inflammatory skin disease, which led to the creation of a fundraiser to raise cash for his treatment at childrenaposs charity Tree of Hope. The bright and talented school pupilwho had a passion for football eventually lost his ability to continue living his normal le as his condition spread.Muhammad, of Leicester, East Midlands, was prescribed methotrexate to treat the disease - a medication that is often prescribed to cancer patients - but his condition did not improve. He had really bad side effects and since , he hasnapost been the same, Mr Bulbulia said.

Up and down the UK drivers have been resisting government calls not to panic by heading out to their local garage for a tank top-up. Fearful that disrupted supply lines will leave them unable to fill up, many motorists have been stuck in long queues for hours, battling those others who had a similar idea. Industry professionals have said that while the queues may look dramatic, there is not too much cause for concern when it comes to actual petrol supply. Less than  of the , filling stations in the UK have been forced to close, the Daily Mail reports. What do you think of the panic buyers  Have your say in the comments  Around  BP garages have shut completely and a maximum of  have run out of at least one type of fuel. A apossmall numberapos of Tesco refilling stations have also been impacted, said Esso owner ExxonMobil, which runs the sites. President of the AA Edmund King reiterated on Saturday that there is plenty of fuel at the source and no need to stock up. The good news is you can only really fill up once - youaposve got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing, he told BBC Breakfast. Itaposs not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc. So, once people have filled up, they wonapost travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days. Concerns about petrol supplies were triggered by supply chain issues caused, in part, by the shortage of heavy goods vehicledrivers. In a bid to fill some of the vacancies caused, in no small part, by Brexit, the government is planning to offer short term visas for EU drivers.  Weaposre looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time limited, a spokeswoman for Johnsonaposs Downing Street office said in a statement. Like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country. The UKaposs Road Haulage Associationsays Britain is facing a shortage of some , drivers, a result of workers leaving the industry, Brexit and Covid-, which put a stop to driver training and testing for about a year. WARNING: The following embedded tweets contain strong language some may find offensiveThe government is reportedly considering granting entry to up to , foreign drivers into Britain on short-term visas, a measure that logistics companies and retailers have demanded for months but which the government had previously ruled out. Brian Madderson, the chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association which represents independent fuel retailers, said he expected the problem to continue for a while longer. I think this situation is going to get worse before it gets better, he told Sky News. EG Group, which runs  forecourts across Britain, said on Friday it would impose a purchase limit of  poundsper customer for fuel due to the unprecedented customer demand. From early on Saturday, motorists began queuing outside filling stations and some forecourts closed as fuel ran out.  I was out on my bike ... and came past my BP garage and it was chaos, Merriman said. As soon as the message gets out there might be a fuel shortage, people understandably react. Police across the country reported congestion caused by motorists waiting in line, and urged people not to contact them about the problems the traffic was causing. Britain, the worldaposs fth-largest economy, is also grappling with a spike in Europe  an natural gas costs causing soaring energy prices and a potential food supply crunch. At least one bust-up has broken out on the countryaposs forecourts, as a clash broke out at a busy petrol station in Portsmouth, Hants, where drivers had flocked to a Shell station. Two groups of men were aposscreamingapos at each other before one group chased another fleeing in a van - hurling stones at the vehicle, according to a witness. The ugly scenes shocked onlookers at a forecourt in the Hilsea area of the city at around .am. A witness said: People were queuing throughout the night. Pumps are almost dry.

This Is Me, Keala Settle’s stirring and emotional classic from The Greatest Showman, includes the lyrics “I know that there’s a place for us, For we are glorious”. And glorious they were as TV stars Fearne Cotton and Kirsty Gallacher looked on in support and admiration. But for Maisie, a very special member of the audience was sister Cecily, . She donated the bone marrow which helped Maisie thrive and overcome the latest cancer onslaught. Having fought the disease since she was seven, Maisie was struck again just before the pandemic hit. And Cecily would be the key to winning this phase of the challenge. Now , Maisie says: “Cecily did an amazing thing. When I found out I had relapsed, that was really tough. But there is more to le than cancer. I try to have a positive attitude and take one day at a time.” Cecily was nervous about the procedure and admits: “I didn’t enjoy it but, of course, I would do it because it was for my sister.” Maisie, from Northampton, is in remission and the sisters hope their story will help raise money during Childhood Cancer Awareness month – as well as spread the message that cancer doesn’t have to define anyone. The London gala for charity Young Lives vs Cancer helped raise £,. Maisie brought the house down with a speech and group performance of This Is Me.TV and radio star Fearne, , was so moved she posted a message on Instagram, saying: “The best bit of the night for me was watching a young lady called Maisie sing for us alongside some other young people who have had cancer.They hadn’t rehearsed in person, only over Zoom, but they totally smashed it.” Maisie says: “She was so lovely, really friendly and down to earth. “She told me I was a great singer – coming from her, that felt amazing!” Young Lives vs Cancer has offered great support – providing somewhere to stay for Maisie’s parents as the youngster twice had gruelling two-month bouts of chemotherapy. The charity also enlisted another group to enable Maisie to attend school remotely via a remarkable AI robot that sat in her classroom seat. It allowed her to keep up to speed with lessons and speak to pals at break times. It was back in January  that parents Sarah, , and Pete, , were told Maisie had leukaemia. She had complained of an aching shoulder and stomach pains. Sarah says: “Maisie was a typical fit, healthy seven-year-old. I was expecting to be told she needed appendix surgery. Instead they told us she had leukaemia. “It just didn’t make sense at all.”  There was no time to waste and the family was told a waiting ambulance would take Maisie from their local Northampton General Hospital to a specialist ward at Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham,  miles away. Two months of chemo began and the parents were placed in Home-From-Home accommodation just a stone’s throw away. Cecily stayed with grandparents and visited when possible. Sarah – who, like husband Pete, works in human resources – goes on: “It was terrying and frightening. We were completely sleep-deprived and entering this whole new world we’d never imagined being part of. We were told it was serious but treatable. But she was very poorly with a low immune system. The hardest day was when she had to get measured for a wheelchair and a wig. “Those were two of the most shocking things. As it happens we didn’t need the wheelchair and it was eight months before her hair came out – and Maisie took everything in her stride. We’d say, ‘It’s fine. We’ve just got to get through this rubbish bit’.” After two months the remaining treatment was mainly managed at home.  Chemo was administered by nurses, through a Hickman line in her chest. She ed to school, though even a mild temperature would put her back in hospital for four days at a time. Maisie’s treatment finally finished in the summer of . But by the end of  she started complaining of leg pain. Shortly before Christmas, almost four years since her first diagnosis, Maisie relapsed. Her leukaemia had ed. On New Year’s Eve she began another two-month round of chemo back in Nottingham. “It was that awful sense of deja vu,” Sarah says. “But we did it the first time and we would do it again.” This time doctors said Maisie would also need a stem cell transplant to stop the leukaemia from ing. Cecily had a one in four chance of being a match.  Her apprehension was understandable. Cecily said: “I have never stayed in hospital or had an operation before, so I didn’t really want to do it but I couldn’t not, so I sucked it up and went ahead.” It was March  – the week of the first lockdown – when Maisie, Cecily and Sarah headed to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital after isolating for weeks together to avoid Cecily getting sick. Sarah says: “I called our consultant and said, ‘Are you sure this is the best time to wipe out a child’s immune system – heading into a pandemic  He told me we didn’t have a choice. Which kind of helped because we just had to press on.” Cecily had bone marrow extracted on April  and watched through a hospital window as the stem cells were delivered into Maisie’s bloodstream. Cecily says: “It was surreal.” For two months Sarah and Maisie stayed in the ward, with mum venturing outside once a week for six minutes to receive fresh clothes from Pete. Maisie and her mum whiled away the hours on TikTok, family quizzes and singing. Sarah adds: “We’d literally cross off the days in that room. The nurses were amazing but it did feel a bit like prison.” Get the latest news straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter One day, she filmed Maisie’s rendition of Rise Up – Andra Day’s hit that became a message of hope for people facing tough times. On that note, the gala was a signicant milestone – and helping the charity is important to the family. Sarah says: “Maisie has been unlucky to be very ill but that’s just a small part of who she is and just a small part of who we are as a family. So many people travel long distances for treatment and that’s why support of Young Lives vs Cancer is so vital. It’s so much harder to cope, and these families have enough to cope with already, so they need that support.” Meanwhile, Maisie hasn’t made a huge fuss about things. And of Cecily, while realising they now share an extra-special bond, she says: “I guess we’re like a lot of sisters – good friends with a few arguments along the way!” And Sarah adds: “Maisie’s enormously resilient and doesn’t think anything bad has ever happened to her. Our children are so much more than their cancer.” For more information or cancer support, visit younglivesvscancer.org.uk Comment MORE ON Kirsty GallacherFearne CottonThis Is MeGreat Ormond Street HospitalNew YearThe Greatest ShowmanHospitalsImmune systemCancerLeukaemia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Here, some of next Sunday’s inspiring competitors reveal why it’s such a cherished race for them… This time, I want to get a medal In , Claire Lomas won fans across the world when she completed the London Marathon after  days. The former horse rider, who was paralysed from the chest down in a riding accident in , wore a robotic suit to take part in the race, raising £, for Spinal Research. But this year, Claire – who was awarded an MBE in  and was one of just  people to be given a Spirit of London Award, guaranteeing her place in this year’s Marathon – is determined to take home a medal.  The -year-old will be competing in motorcycle gear to raise money for Whizz-Kidz, a charity that transforms the lives of disabled youths. Claire, who lives in Melton Mowbray, Leics, said: “I am hoping to complete it in a day but it’s going to be tough. “My husband Dan and friend Stuart will be accompanying me as my grid girls complete with heels, dresses and wigs.” To sponsor Claire, text CLAIRELM £ to . Iaposve loved training alongside my DNA twin When Vicky Lawrence and Elliott Brock cross the finish line at the London Marathon, few spectators will know the bond the two runners have. In , physiotherapist Elliott, , donated his bone marrow to save Vicky’s le after the eight-year- old was diagnosed with severe aplastic anaemia.  At the time of the le-saving op, in Vicky’s home town of Birmingham, the pair were complete strangers. Vicky’s family wrote numerous letters to Elliott to say how grateful they were, but it wasn’t until Vicky started studying for her A-levels that he finally replied and they became firm friends. Vicky, who is now  and a third-year medical student at Newcastle University, first suggested they take on the London Marathon to raise money for Anthony Nolan UK two years ago.  Dad-of-two Elliott, who lives in Colchester, Essex, said: “I foolishly agreed, but have loved the training and can’t wait to run alongside my DNA twin. “There’s something poetic about Vicky getting me off my backside and healthy after I saved her le all those years ago.”To sponsor Vicky and Elliott, go to justgiving fundraising victoria-lawrence Iaposm doing it for Wilma Nicknamed Iron Man, Andy Farrer really is a hero who has superhuman strength. The -year-old runs marathons carrying an ironing board and iron in tribute to his late partner Wilma Patton-Brolly, who took her own le in , aged . The pair, who met on a blind date in , enjoyed a quirky pastime called “extreme ironing”, in which they posed for photos in scenic locations with an ironing board.  Andy was planning to propose to Wilma at the finish line of the London Marathon in . Instead, he now spends his time raising awareness of suicide prevention. Andy, who never trains for his runs and cracks open a beer on the starting line, already holds the Guinness World Record for doing the London Marathon while carrying an ironing board and iron – and is keen to repeat it. Since he started running, the Sainsbury’s meat counter worker has raised around £, for charity and is aiming to raise £, for VICTA next weekend.  Andy, from Portrush in Northern Ireland, said: “If you’re holding an ironing board, people ask questions. I can talk about mental health, suicide and the Samaritans. “If I can help other families avoid the suffering we’ve had, that’s my goal.”To support Andy visit uk.virginmoneygiving andyfarrer My daughter ran race before she was even born Lillie Clibbon-Grant has already run the London Marathon – despite having never competed before – as her mother ran it in , unaware she was two-and-a-half weeks pregnant. Lara Grant was so surprised by her “midle baby” that she wrote to race sponsors Flora once Lillie was born to ask for a medal for her newborn. When they posted one, they also invited Lillie to take part as soon as she was old enough, in  – and now the -year-old is doing just that. Flora also arranged for three-time London Marathon winner Paula Radclfe to help Lillie out by giving her some training tips via Zoom. Catering manager Lara, , from Reading, Berks, jokes that Lillie “must have been the race’s youngest competitor”. But Lillie, who is raising money for Newbury charity Time to Talk, said: “It inspired me to get into sport. I’m excited to be running. I hope I do Mum proud.”Flora’s Get Towns Active Campaign arranged for marathon veteran Paula Radclfe to surprise Lillie.

For a limited time, it’s acquired an edge, a kick, a fiery twist to tantalise your tastebuds. Introducing the Zinger Popcorn Bucket.Trialled in ten lucky locations in April, it proved so popular it’s now officially launching across the UK, so that everyone can feel the burn! But where are the spice fiends who’ll be going straight off to order it, and which of us Brits are more chary with the chilli  SPICE UP YOUR LIFE KFC surveyed the nation’s spice preferences, asking residents in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, London, the North East, North West, Yorkshire, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, South East and South West how spicy they like their food. The results show that it’s Londoners who have the biggest appetite for heat:  per cent of those in the capital said they like their food to be nice and spicy or even to feel their mouths on fire. The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right. But those in the South West were wrongly assumed to have the least tolerance for the tingle factor. And what about you  Can you take the heat  If you’re a dance-till-dawn, touch-of-the-hedonist kind of person who loves food that makes your eyes widen and your tongue take notice, the Zinger Popcorn Bucket is your order of dreams. If you get your kicks from breaking in your new lambswool slippers in front of Call the Midwe, and your flavour frisson comes from a sprinkling of parsley... maybe not so much.

The family live in a -bed former care home over four floors in Morecambe, Lancashire, and often update their followers with videos on YouTube. In the latest offering, Sue, , started by showing off the childrenaposs play area at the front of the mega property which has swings and a slide. Itaposs also where the kids store their bikes, and the family hopes to soon buy a plastic storage facility to put them in, she explained. I think thataposs going to be next on the to do list, the busy mum - who runs a bakery alongside husband Noel,  - told the camera. Sue then walked across the articial lawn in the back garden where the family boasts a collection of luxurious sun loungers, a hot tub, fire pit and bar and adjoining seating area. She said they are planning to buy a gazebo to put the hot tub in so they can continue to enjoy it now that autumn has arrived. I have to say [the hot tub] has just been the best thing ever, admitted Sue. The kids all get so much enjoyment out of that.  Sue and Noel - who famously donapost rely on any benefits to support their brood - currently have  of their kids living under their roof, with many sharing bedrooms. The two oldest - Chris, , and Sophie,  - have previously flown the nest. Their th child, Alfie, was sadly stillborn in .  Pointing to the grey seating area with scatter cushions, the mum said: I just love this area, itaposs so nice. You can sit here with a nice cup of coffee in the evening and just chill out when the kids have gone to bed. But her favourite spot is the bar. This is probably one of my most favourite things in the garden along with the hot tub. Itaposs just brilliant, said Sue.  In a previous video last year, Noel had explained how he had built it with the help of daughter Chloe, , and son James, , during the Covid lockdown. Itaposs just been so brilliant. We just love it, gushed Sue. Nicknamed aposThe Lockdown Barapos, it has been decorated with a wind chime and signs, including one that says: I wine because they wine!  They also have a barbecue and pizza oven for outdoor dinners. Sue explained: This was Aldiaposs pizza oven and it is really really good. Weaposve had so many nights with the kids making their own pizzas and things so thataposs been a massive hit. Earlier this year, Sue and Noel began a major DIY project, in which they transformed their garden, including adding an articial lawn which they vacuum to keep clean.

Alleyways have been deluged and farmland and country lanes deemed up for grabs as illegal dumping has rocketed more than %. It seems anything and everything is being tipped – even caravans filled with trash. A worrying Sunday Mirror probe found:Councils face , tipping incidents a week, costing £million a year to clear up.The rat population has soared  million as critters scurry amid piles of rotting waste.Some councils charge £-plus to remove larger items... so people dump them instead. Less frequent refuse collections fuels the anti-social habit – as do typical fees of £ per bag of rubble at some council skip sites. A shocking % of farmers had tonnes of rubbish dumped on their land last year. Damaged fridges and freezers ooze ozone-harming gases – hugely embarrassing weeks before the COP climate summit in Britain. Prime offenders are waste clearance outfits and dodgy builders avoiding typical £-per-ton fees at landfill sites. Latest figures show a million fly-tipping incidents were recorded in a year. And the problem got a whole lot worse in lockdown. Figures from ClearWaste, which collects data on fly-tipping, show a % rise in incidents in just one four-month spell. Courts can impose an unlimited fine or a five-year jail term for the worst offenders. But ClearWaste found most councils didn’t prosecute anyone for fly-tipping in the last financial year. And  local authorities didn’t issue a single fine over the same period. ClearWaste founder Martin Montague said: “Britain is drowning under a sea of illegally dumped rubbish which blights our towns, cities and countryside.” Most recent government data shows the trash logged in just one year.  There were , single items, , loads equal to a bin bag, , up to the size of a car boot, , small van loads, , Transit loads and , loads dumped by bigger trucks. Fly-tipping has been increasing steadily since  as councils have had to slash waste services due to swingeing budget cuts. Experts believe the closure of rubbish dumps during Covid, plus increased work on homes, helped the problem run out of control. Many councils – like Oldham, Somerset, East Devon, Warwick and Bracknell Forest – only empty the bins every three weeks. In the past week, Stirling Council in Scotland became the latest local authority to move to monthly bin collections. Residents in Falkirk, north of the border, and Conwy, Wales, also now have non-recyclable waste collected monthly. Waste services could be slashed again in   – with Unison predicting a £billion black hole in local authority finances. Mike Short, the union’s head of local government, said: “Weekly collections are increasingly rare. Some authorities moved to fortnightly, three weekly or monthly collections, with charges for some services. “Most services are outsourced. Providers win those contracts based on how cheap they are.”  He said fees for removing big items are a factor. Disposing of a large fridge in Bromley, South London, will cost £ – after navigating a -point spreadsheet and four-page form. Mr Short added: “It’s not surprising to see councils increasing charges and fees. But the cost could lead to fly-tipping.” Keith Williams, of the GMB union, said a lack of HGV drivers has hit refuse collections. There are health issues too. UK rat numbers increased from million in  to million last year as they feasted on lockdown trash, according to Pest. Ian Williams, a professor of applied environmental science at the University of Southampton, says tipping can be deadly. He worked on a study which showed dumping rose % in rural areas in April last year. He said: “Fly-tipping causes pollution and is a health threat. Hazardous waste, like asbestos, is potentially le threatening. If you turf fridges and freezers out of a van, pipes will break and you’ release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Vermin and flies congregate, especiallythere is food contamination.  “Smaller mammals can become trapped in tipped materials and consequences for hedgerows are signicant because you block light, preventing growth. This has an impact on things such as pollination.” Some landowners are under fly-tipping siege. In June last year,  tonnes of rubbish was cleared from a field in Uxbridge, West London. Weeks later,  tonnes of waste was ditched on a Lincolnshire farm. In Hampshire, tippers abandoned their truck after it got stuck in mid-air while unloading. In December, seven caravans filled with waste were dumped in the countryside near Cottenham, Cambs, filled with personal belongings and white goods. Taxpayers paid the £, removal costs. This month, a truck dumped  tonnes on an industrial estate in Woolston, Cheshire, while another caravan full of pushchairs and wardrobes was dumped by the A near Beaconsfield, Bucks. Richard Bramley, chair of the environment forum at the National Farmers’ Union, said: “We’ve had fairly horric reports of lorryloads at night. Farmers take pride in their patch and this industrial scale littering really does irk them. It’s astonishing we have to put up with it. We need a national strategy and website for reporting incidents to find hotspots. A fine can be less than skip hire cost – hardly a deterrent.” David Renard, Local Government Association environment spokesman, said: “Fly-tipping is inexcusable and an eyesore costing taxpayers £million a year. It could be spent on vital services. “With councils battling , incidents of fly-tipping a week, we call on the Government in the spending review to ensure councils have funding and flexibility to tackle this scourge. “We also urge a sentencing review to ensure those caught and prosecuted receive signicant fines to deter them from spoiling parks, highways and verges again – and to help offset the huge costs to councils.” The Department for Environment Food  Rural Affairs says fly-tipping prosecutions were , in - and , in -. A spokesman said: “Prosecutions have increased % since , with councils achieving a % conviction rate and more than , fixed penalty notices issued in -. “There’s more to do. We are committed to overhauling and improving the waste carrier, broker and dealer regime through increased checks, as well as mandatory electronic waste tracking.” Comment MORE ON Crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The “brilliant” -year-old had taken over a Year One class only shortly before her murder nine days ago. Lisa Williams, headteacher at Rushey Green Primary School in Lewisham, south London, said all the pupils and staff were devastated. She added: “Sabina was a brilliant teacher. She was kind, caring and absolutely dedicated to her pupils.” Sabina’s body was found in Cator Park, near her home in Kidbrooke, south east London, after she failed to arrive for a Friday night date at a pub. Yesterday a child’s white T-shirt with the message, “Thank you for being my teacher” hand-written in felt-tip pen was among tributes left at the park.  It is understood Ms Williams visited each class to talk to pupils, with educational psychologists also offering help. The Duchess of Cambridge yesterday spoke of her grief for Sabina on her official Twitter feed. She wrote: “I am saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets. My thoughts are with Sabina’s family and friends.”  An unnamed teacher at the -pupil school told a local newspaper: “It’s hard for teachers to reassure children while they are themselves consumed with grief. “The Year Two pupils who she had last year in Year One will be the most upset – and their parents.” Sabina, from Bedfordshire, studied at the University of Greenwich before completing her PGCE teacher training last year at her local university. Her colleague, one of  staff at the school, said: “The first anyone knew was when we arrived on Monday.  “It’s awful enough when someone dies – this is so much worse. It’s impossible to comprehend. We were sitting beside her on Friday… then this.” Police yesterday searched drains near to where Sabina died and also want to trace a balding man seen close by at the time on CCTV. Revealing he was holding a “red reflective item”, they said they are keeping an open mind as to whether it may have been used in her murder. Det Chief Insp Neil John said: “People may recall this man carrying a red reflective object, and possibly trying to conceal it up his sleeve.” On Friday night hundreds of mourners, including parents and pupils from Sabina’s school, gathered for a candlelight vigil in her memory.  Her sister, Jebina Yasmin Islam, broke down in tears as she told them: “I’ve lost my caring, beautul sister.” Sabina’s death has sparked fresh anger over women’s safety, six months after the murder of Sarah Everard, , by Met police officer Wayne Couzens.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeEducationMurderSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Pictures emerged showing people drinking pints atop graves at Norton Beer Festival in Norton Village has caused ripples of outrage to spread through the local community.The behaviour has been labelled disrespectful and disgusting, Gazette Live reported. One person claimed theyaposd be devastatedit was their familiesapos resting place. Taking to social media, one shocked resident wrote: Why couldnapost they sit on the green, which is just outside, instead of on graves  I think itaposs appalling. Would they think it okit was young adults  What a total lack of respect for the deceased and their families.Did you attend the beer festival  Get in touch at webnews@mirror Another wrote: Fair enough holding a beer festival but come on, don’t have it centred around the cemetery. There’s enough space around Norton for people to meet friends and have a few drinks without needing to sit on graves. The event, which ed after a two and a half year absence, is hosted by the church in conjunction with The Three Brothers Brewing Company. The three-day celebration is split between the car park where there is a mobile bar, food stalls and toilets, and the main festival inside the church. In between is a path with the graveyard surrounding it. According to the Brewery manager David Dodd: There are lots of clear spaces within the graveyard which were used by people for seating with tables and chairs set out accordingly.Given it was a lovely day many people were enjoying the weather and the opportunity to be together, which is what this festival is for.At no point were chairs put around gravestones by staff and it was certainly not recommended for people to sit on them. For future events there will be signage and taping off sections to make this clearer. We will also have even more chairs available outside to give people an alternative.  He continued: To put an event of this size coming out of covid has been a massive undertaking for our tiny family team alongside our day job of running a brewery making and delivering beer around the North East. Itaposs also a huge step in terms of logistics and infrastructure whilst making it a manageable and safe space for attendees. The suggestion to spill out on to the green is not possible as the perimeter fence offers a great barrier from a licensing and security point of view. Part of every entry ticket includes a donation to St Maryaposs building maintenance raising some vital funds for this stunning church after the pandemic. It is also worth noting that we had a great local security firm supporting us at the event and we have not been made aware of any instances of antisocial behaviour, only positive feedback about how St Maryaposs Beer Festival has been a truly unique event. Rev. Martin Anderson, who has worked at the church for the last eight years, also responded to the criticism. The village church of St Mary’s is a beautul space in the heart of Norton - it’s wonderful that we have the opportunity to use the space for a iety of purpose, he said. On the whole, the people attending the festival have been respectful of the space and there has been a real sense of community and positivity. However, like in all areas of le, there are sometimes a small group who donapost see or do things from the same perspective. We didnapost want people to use tombstones as tables, and our security firm was working to make sure everything was kept calm in the church yard and the building itself. As a parish church in Norton, we work really hard to support the community of Norton in times of celebration but also in times of bereavement. The festival took place over the weekend, from Friday  September to Sunday .

While there is plenty of fuel in supply, a lorry driver shortage has left oil giants struggling to transport it to the pumps. The problem has led to panic buying with scenes across England of people queuing and bickering over fuel as forecourts shut and pumps run out of gas. The fiasco means some drivers may feel forced to take a risk and making a journey while running low on petrol or diesel.Not only will it be an inconvenienceyou do run out, it could be dangerousit happens on a motorway or a busy thoroughfare - and that could land you in trouble with the law, Essex Live reports.  In most vehicles,your fuel light switches on that means you have  to  per cent of your tank left, according to the experts at the RAC. If it starts flashing, then levels are even lower and you are in danger of becoming stranded as you drive. Running out of fuel isn’t illegal in itself, but any careless or dangerous driving that results from it could see you punished under the law. If youaposre forced to stop in the road and cause an obstruction, you could receive a penalty of £ and three points on your driving licence. In a worst case scenario,your empty fuel tank leads to a road traffic collision you could be issued with nine points and an unlimited fine.  Careless driving carries an unlimited fine, which could run up to around £, and up to nine penalty points. And of course, causing a serious crash could land you in the courts to face serious charges.Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart Director of Policy and Research, told the: “We have very little sympathy for drivers who run out of fuel on the motorway. There is no excuse for entering a motorway with low fuel oryou know something is wrong with your car. A breakdown puts you and your passengers at very high risk – many fatal crashes on a motorway involve a stationary vehicle. The RAC advise that you donapost enter a motorway while running low on fuel, howeveryou do and run out, you should pull over onto the hard shoulder and call for breakdown help. The Government last night announced measures to tackle the shortage of drivers. It will temporarily relax migration rules to allow in more than , workers to plug the gaps.. Haulage industry bosses have estimated there is a shortage of nearly , HGV and lorry drivers nationwide. The problem has been blamed on combination of the loss of EU workers post-Brexit, and on delays to HGV driver training caused by the pandemic.

Simon Kendall, , survived the jump but le-changing injuries resulted in the amputation of both legs. His story of childhood sexual abuse, self-harm and dismay at the way he was treated by the mental health system is the subject of a book called Beneath the Scars, written by his friend Debbie Rigby. None of Simonaposs alleged abusers was ever prosecuted because of the lack of evidence, despite a police inquiry.Simons says heaposs forgiven one abuser thanks to his friend Debbie, NottinghamshireLive.Do you have a story that youaposd like to share with our readers  Email us at webnews@mirror Simon, who lives alone with his greyhound Marley, said: I have been able to come to terms with the abuse but by sending me to the adult unit at Mapperley Hospital aged , I am still haunted by that experience to this day. And I believeI hadnapost felt judged by many of the medical and psychiatric staff Iaposve come across and not made to feel abnormal by a few, my le would be completely dferent now. Simon was seven when he was first referred to a psychiatrist, who prescribed tablets which helped for a while. As a child, he said he struggled to understand the abuse he suffered and acted out his emotions at school by kicking chairs and fighting with teachers and other pupils. *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

His parents were told his behaviour was due to teenage hormones and he was sent home. After another overdose, he was referred to the unit again and it was there he witnessed a girl injure herself by stubbing out a burning cigarette on the back of her hand. He said he did the same and found it helped him to cope - which started the pattern of self-harm. What followed was years of cutting himself so badly that he has lost count of how many stitches he has had to his face, arms and hands.  At , he told a caseworker that heaposd been sexually abused, not by one but two people. He tried to escape the adolescent unit and ended up hitting and biting six nurses who tried to restrain him, resulting in him being sectioned and sent to the adult unit, at the former Mapperley Hospital, or as he describes it, the hell hole. He said: I felt like I was a prisoner there and my only crime was not knowing how to deal with my abuse. I saw things in this unit which would terry an adult, let alone a child, and each time I tried to escape I was thrown into a padded cell. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.I still have flashbacks now about being there. Sometimes when asleep, and I dream about Mapperley, I wake up crying and shouting. Simon says he was eventually diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder after going through multiple assessments with dferent professionals. In one dark moment, Simon cut his face in a form of self-harm, hoping to look as threatening as possible would ward off any potential abusers. Simon later got his face tattooed to prevent himself from self-harm and to keep potential rapists at bay by making him, in his words, look like a complete and raving psycho. The book Beneath the Scars tells his story of how he lost consciousness immediately after jumping from the bridge and apologises to the drivers who rushed to his aid, saying how he regrets putting them through it and thanking them for their help. Debbie was by his side when years later he decided toto Mapperley Hospital - by then renamed Duncan Macmillan House in Porchester Road - in a bid to put some of his demons to rest. Debbie, , arranged for him to speak to staff and said: They validated that he shouldnapost have been there at the age of  and that was really helpful for Simon to hear. The mother-of-three spent hours listening to him relive his troubled past and suggested writing it down in the hope that it might be cathartic, always checking he was OK to continue, with the reassurance that he could stop at any time. Part-way through, Simon suggested writing it up as a book to help those people who have gone through similar experiences and their families and friends - and as a learning curving for professionals too. He said: I just want to get my story out there, because even though over the last ten or so years, I have had better experiences in AE and I am grateful for that, I want to help nurses, doctors and psychiatric nurses gain more understanding around self-injury. I would love in future for others who self-injure to receive more compassionate treatment than I received in the past because I believe this will help with their healing, not just physically but mentally and emotionally. It seems as though because my self-injury is deliberate, some professionals see my treatment as a drain on resources. I wonderI had used another coping strategy such as alcohol or drugs, would they also have seen my treatment as a drain on NHS resources  Iaposm still a human being andonly they had not put me in a box to be treated a certain way because I had deliberately injured myself and instead they had taken the time to try and understand those reasons and the effects of my experiences, things would be dferent. I have been accused of attention-seeking by doctors and I try to explain but they donapost get it. One thing that sticks out in my mind is when I had sliced through my Achilles tendon again. The doctor said aposnext time you do it, donapost do it down there, do it hereapos and he ran his finger across his throat. I was shocked and stunned. I still canapost believe that a doctor would say such a thing. When Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust was contacted about the incident, a spokesperson said: We’re sorry to hear that Mr Kendall had an upsetting incident in our hospital around  years ago. Practice in our emergency department is very dferent now, and there is a Rapid Response Liaison Psychiatry Team in place that help patients with mental health needs who come to our department.” People who injure themselves are usually given a list of aposcoping strategiesapos which are supposed to distract them from the urge - such as hitting cushions, going for a run, or putting ice cubes on the area selected for cutting. Simon says: My coping strategy  Iaposve got Debbie. She is the only person, apart from my GP, and now my most recent psychiatrist, who I felt truly listened to me in an empathic and non-judgemental way. Simon adds: Judging people by the way they look can cause a totally dferent and negative response to that person, whereas professionals who treat you with genuine understanding and acceptance, without judgement - thataposs the most helpful thing someone who injures themselves can experience. Chris Ashwell, associate director for mental health services at Nottinghamshire Healthcare, told NottinghamshireLive: Weaposre sorry to hear about Mr Kendallaposs experience of mental health services in the .As with all mental health conditions, we have a much better understanding of self-harm than we did  years ago. Today a -year-old in need of inpatient care would almost always be admitted to Hopewood, our purpose-built mental health unit for children, young people and families. In the rare event that a young person had to be admitted to an adult mental health unit now, they would be cared for away from the general adult population of the ward.Self-harm is a symptom of emotional distress. Our work with young people is focused on addressing the underlying reasons for this distress and supporting them to develop less harmful and more positive coping mechanisms.Beneath the Scars is available to buy through Waterstones, Amazon or by emailing Debbie at beneaththescars@gmail, priced £.. *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Some UK service stations are rationing fuel as the lorry driver shortage hits petrol supply chains and forces forecourts up and down the country to shut. Worried drivers formed lines before the break of dawn in hopes of filling up, as scenes queuing stretched into a second day. Others were seen carrying jerry cans onto forecourts.At least one bust-up as been witnessed, as a clash broke out at a busy petrol station in Portsmouth, Hants, where drivers had flocked to a Shell station. Two groups of men were aposscreamingapos at each other before one group chased another fleeing in a van - hurling stones at the vehicle, according to a witness. The ugly scenes shocked onlookers at a forecourt in the Hilsea area of the city at around .am. A witness said: People were queuing throughout the night. Pumps are almost dry.Have you been affected by the shortage  Email your stories and pictures to webnews@mirror The man said the groups were screaming and shouting at each other. He added: One group got into their van and drove off out of the city as the other group gave chase and hurled stones at the retreating van. Itaposs utter madness. Lengthy queues were being spotted today around London, Essex and Kent to Bristol and Cambridgeshire, as industry bosses warned the capital and south of England were worst affected. Some petrol stations had road cones blocking forecourt lanes and signs announcing they were closed as pumps ran dry. Police forces are pleading with drivers to be apossensibleapos as lines were seen stretching around roundabouts in some parts of England. EG Group, which runs hundreds of forecourts across Britain, imposed a purchase limit of £ per customer for fuel due to the unprecedented customer demandaposapos.  Petrol retailers say they are unable to transport fuel due to a lack of lorry drivers, which is being blamed on Brexit labour shortages and the pandemic. Some firms have offered handsome cash incentives, salary increases and free training in desperate bids to recruit and retain drivers, as the exodus of EU workers left firms struggling to fill the gap. Reports have speculated the government is likely to bow shortly to industry demand to issue temporary migrant visas to plug the gaps.  Haulage industry bosses have warned the UK is short nearly , lorry drivers. The problem is being exacerbated by a gas price hike crisis threatening the UKaposs food supplies and driving up energy bills to eye-watering rates. Lincolnshire Police warned the queues could cause chaos on the roads and urged drivers not to fill upthey donapost need to. The force said: This is a potential hazard for vehicles making other journeys, and may cause dficulties for emergency services trying to reach people in need. While we appreciate that some people may be particularly keen to fill up their vehicles this weekend, we would respectfully ask motorists to be sensible when making judgements about joining a queue at a petrol station. If it is too long, consider ing at a dferent time. The president of the AA says panic-buying rather than supply chain issues is driving the shortage of fuel at some petrol stations.  Edmund King said the problem should pass in a matter of daysdrivers just stick to filling up when they need it, adding there is plenty of fuel at source. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr King said shortage of lorry drivers had only been a localised problem earlier in the week. We were in discussions with Government ministers last night and we talked to the major fuel companies, and we can reiterate there is not a problem with supply at the source, Mr King said. Earlier in the week, there were some problems with the supply chain, as we know, due to a shortage of some lorry drivers, but that was only a localised problem.  Mr King warned the shortage had been exacerbated by people going out and filling up when they really donapost need to. If you think about it,  million cars out there,theyaposve all got half a tank they all rush out to fill up the rest of the tank and the tank is about  litres, that will put a strain on the system, he said. Mr King said the issues were unlikely to last because the supply chain is not being disrupted by ongoing problems such as industrial action. The good news is you can only really fill up once - youaposve got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing, he said.  Itaposs not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc. So, once people have filled up, they wonapost travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days. However Mr King said the lorry driver shortage would remain an ongoing issue for the industry until solutions were found. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together. “Without them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops. “Currently, the UK faces a shortfall of around , HGV drivers and it is consumers who ultimately suffer the consequences.” Comment MORE ON Panic-buyingVehiclesBPOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The document, more than a decade old, deals with her case against her sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein. The Duke of Yorkaposs legal team has demanded to unseal the document, which it claims will waive her right to pursue legal action against the royal. However her legal team has rubbished the oppositionaposs hopes, saying the aposreleaseapos relating to Epsteinaposs sex abuse case does not apply to Prince Andrew. Ms Giuffre accuses Andrew of forcing her to have sex with her at Epsteinaposs associate Ghislaine Maxwellaposs home while she was underage. The duke vehemently denies the allegations.  The ongoing legal battle currently playing out in New York had been mired in arguments over whether the royal had been properly served with Ms Giuffreaposs lawsuit. The prince and his accuser have since agreed that service was effective as of September , according to a joint filing with the US District Court in Manhattan. Subject to court approval, Andrew has until October  to formally respond to her lawsuit. The agreement ended a monthlong effort by Andrewaposs legal team to block Ms Giuffreaposs lawsuit at the outset, rather than have the -year-old prince defend against it.  The duke is accused of forcing Ms Giuffre her to have sex around two decades ago, when she was underage, at the London home of Maxwell, Epsteinaposs longtime associate. Ms Giuffreaposs lawsuit also alleges Andrew abused her at Epsteinaposs mansion in Manhattan and on the late billionaire financieraposs private island in the US Virgin Islands. Andrew has not been charged with any crimes. The document his lawyers are seeking to review is a  settlement agreement from a lawsuit against Epstein in Florida, to determine whether it requires a dismissal of Ms Giuffreaposs case.According to the Sun on Sunday, the document is a aposreleaseapos Andrewaposs legal team is hoping will exempt him from Ms Giuffreaposs lawsuit.But her lawyers have reportedly branded it “irrelevant” and say the agreement releases lawyers, employees, agents and heirs from liability in connection with the Epstein case - not the duke. Her lawyer, David Boies, reportedly said in a legal document filed in New York this week that he was happy to hand the document over to Andrewaposs team. He said: “Although we believe that the release is irrelevant to the case against Prince Andrew, now that service has been accepted and the case is proceeding to a determination on the merits, we believe that counsel for Prince Andrew have a right to review the release and to make whatever arguments they believe appropriate based on it.“Accordingly, we have given Mr Epstein’s Estate notice of Prince Andrew’s request and have asked the Estate to consent to our providing a copy of the release to Prince Andrew’s counsel.” Ms Giuffre is seeking unspecied damages in her lawsuit against the Queenaposs second son. Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself at age  in a New York jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Giuffre sued Andrew under a  New York law that gave survivors of childhood sexual abuse a since-closed two-year window to sue their alleged abusers over conduct occurring many years or decades earlier. Maxwell faces trial in New York in November to face charges she helped recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse.

Giuffre sued Andrew under a  New York law that gave survivors of childhood sexual abuse a since-closed two-year window to sue their alleged abusers over conduct occurring many years or decades earlier. Maxwell faces a scheduled November  trial in Manhattan on charges she helped recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse.

Harry and Meghan famously quit the royal family - in a split dubbed aposMegxitapos - to move to the US and carve out new lives. They have since levelled a number of criticisms at the Firm in interviews, including claims of racism. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror  But one Palace insider has alleged that the couple are still following the royal model - and could be trying to establish a rival court to Prince William and Kate Middleton.They told the Sun : There are going to be some very nervous glances from the Palace because Harry and Meghan are effectively following the royal model. The Palace will be anxious the causes they support and people they hang around with does nothing to embarrass the Queen.Kate and Wills show how the job of working royals is done. They won’t be impressed with Harry and Meghan acting as quasi-royals and courting publicity after claiming they quit for privacy. Omid Scobie, the author of the biography Finding Freedom, about the Sussexes, said last month that the couple were entering a new era of visibility.

The coupleaposs current tour saw them address a crowd of , people in the Big Apple. They took to the stage at Global Citizen Live to push for the Covid vaccine to be made more readily available around the world to poorer nations. Meghan said: “Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine but thataposs not happening. “It is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just ten wealthy nations and not everyone , itaposs just not OK.” Harry added: “Guys, we have what we need to vaccinate the world.”Since moving to the US last year, the Sussexes have embraced their celebrity status, by taking part in regular interviews on American television and penning deals with Netflix and Spoty.But they have also been criticised for regular attacks on the royal family, and from some quarters for preaching to people on subjects like equality from their position of privilege. In their latest charitable cause, they attended the Covid concert with Harry putting his hand on Meghan’s shoulder and saying: “My we and I believe that where you’re born should not dictate your ability to survive.” Representatives for the Sussexes and Buckingham Palace have been approached for comment by the Mirror.

The memoir is expected to hit the shelves next year - possibly around the time the Queen is celebrating her historic Diamond Jubilee. Harry said he is writing the book not as the prince I was born, but as the man I have become and stated that it will include the highs and the lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned. Buckingham Palace fear further explosive headlines as they pick up the pieces from Harry and Meghan Markleaposs tell-all Oprah interview. He has been secretly working on a memoir for nearly a year - and it has triggered a tsunami of fear among royal circles.But royal author and publisher Andrew Lownie believes Harry’s personal account could prove to be a step too far for the Firm.He told the Express that the memoir could sour Harryaposs already tricky relationship with his family.He said: “I think given the fact that he’s doing his tell-all book, I would have thought that’s the final straw for them.  The book will be published by Penguin Random House UK, with all proceeds to be donated to charity. Despite profits heading to good causes, two-thirds of Brits says they are aposnot interested at allapos in reading it. Over a third say it is aposinappropriateapos for him to publish it. A YouGov survey found says almost one in  people say he should not have signed the publishing agreement - and most wonapost read it.  In a statement confirming the book, the Duke said: Iaposm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. “Iaposve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story - the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned. I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. “Iaposm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what Iaposve learned over the course of my le so far and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my le thataposs accurate and wholly truthful.” But a source told the Daily Mirror the book has struck fear into the family. “Ever since leaving royal le, Harry and Meghan have made claim after claim of how they allege they have been treated, the insider explained. “They say that it is their truth but there is only ever one truth. “Since their interview with Oprah Winfrey tensions have been running very high as much of what they said has since been proven to be unreliable at best. “There is a now tsunami of fear among the royals over what Harry will write.

Meghan Markle after she threw a tiara tantrum has been retold by a royal expert in their new book.Andrew Morton, author of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, claims the Duke and Duchess of Sussexes behaviour in the lead up to the wedding earned rebuke from the Queen.In six new chapters of the book that was first published in , Mr Morton says The Times reported how Meghan threw a tiara tantrum shortly before the wedding.He writes: In November , just days after the couple ed from their successful tour Down Under, The Times reported that Meghan had thrown a ‘tiara tantrum’ shortly before her wedding because the tiara she wanted to wear was not available.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign upHer prima-donna behaviour apparently earned a rebuke from the Queen herself, who told Harry: ‘She gets what tiara she’s given by me.’ In Mr Mortonaposs bombshell piece, he also claims Prince Harry was irate when Meghan did not get her way.Mr Morton continues: The Queen’s formidable dresser Angela Kelly, who isof Her Majesty’s jewellery, is said to have informed the irate Prince that certain security protocols had to be adhered to in order to access the priceless piece.Harry would have none of it, telling anyone who would listen: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’ His ringing phrase did her no favours. It comes as Mr Morton also claims the Sussexes were driven out by Prince Williamaposs bullying attitude. It has always been strongly denied that William bullied his family members. Last year, the brothers said they were deeply, deeply unhappy about bullying claims. Prince Harry was reported to have said he felt pushed out by his brother, but the pair spoke out blasting the offensive claims.The rare joint statement read: Despite clear denials, a  story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between The Duke of Sussex and The Duke of Cambridge. “For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.”It comes as reports have suggested the Sussexes are keen to visit the UK after quitting as senior royals and moving to Calornia early last year.Harry has only ed to the UK twice since the move, while Meghan and two-year-old Archie have not been back so far.The royal brothers have only reunited a few times this year, at Prince Philipaposs funeral and at the unveiling of a statue to their mum, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace on what would have been her th birthday.Comment MORE ON Meghan MarkleAngela KellyAndrew MortonThe QueenPrince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrincess DianaPrince WilliamKensington PalaceThe TimesMarriageRoyal FamilyMental healthJewelleryBullying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A -second clip shows a balding man wearing a black hooded coat and grey jeans looking over his shoulder and pulling at his hood as he walks down a path. The Met spokesperson told the Mirror earlier today the force was not speculating about the appearance of the manaposs hands or reports of how Sabina may have been killed. Earlier today reports claim police sources believe she was pounced upon and attacked with a hammer just moments after leaving her flat on what should have been a five-minute walk across a park to her pub date.  Detectives have also released an image, captured in the Pegler Square area of Kidbrooke, of a silver car they believe the man has access to. The Met has appealed for anyone who recognised either to contact the force immediately. Detective chief inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said an extensive trawl of CCTV in the area continued and said information on the manaposs identity and whereabouts could be vital to the investigation. Sabina was walking to meet a date at The Depot bar in Pegler Square near her home at around .pm last Friday when she was attacked.  A member of the public found her body under a pile of leaves close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park, in the borough of Greenwich, on Saturday at around .pm. The politan Police said a -year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of Sabinaaposs murder. The suspect was arrested at an address in Lewisham on Thursday and is being questioned in custody. It is the second arrest Scotland Yard has made in connection with the attack. On Saturday, detectives arrested a man in his s on suspicion of murder before he was released under further investigation.  Ms Nessaaposs cousin Zubel Ahmed remembered her as a beautul soul who loved teaching, telling the BBC that she was the most caring person - kindest, sweetest girl you could meet. Lisa Williams, the head of Rushey Green Primary School where Ms Nessa taught, said staff and pupils are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news of her death and will be remembering the teacher privately. In a statement, Mrs Williams said: We have shared the details about the vigil with our school community and some people may be attending on a personal level to privately pay their respects.  As a school we are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news we received this week, and will be commemorating Sabina in our own way. The vigil is being held on Friday evening at pm at Pegler Square, and people who cannot attend are being encouraged to hold a candle at their doorstep at the same time. Reclaim These Streets, a campaign group involved in supporting the Kidbrooke communityaposs vigil for Sabina, said it is angry and heartbroken about her murder. Tower Hamlets Councillor Rabina Khan told BBC Radio aposs Today programme said she was attending the vigil this evening and hoped high profile people would also attend. I too, just like my daughters, I have a -year-old, I have a -year-old, we spoke up for Sarah Everard, she said.

The Met is appealing for help in finding a balding man shown on CCTV walking through Pegler Square in Kidbrooke, south-east London - the area where the primary school teacher was heading on the evening she died. The force released the video on Friday and said the man is believed to have been carrying a reflective red object. DCI Neil John, from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, said the man, pictured wearing a black hooded jacket and grey jeans, may have been trying to hide the object up his sleeve.  He said: “I continue to appeal for any witnesses and anyone with information to contact police and share what they know. “People in the Kidbrooke area last Friday may recall seeing this man carrying a red reflective object, and possibly trying to conceal it up his sleeve. If so, please call police. “Please share the CCTV footage on social media and, especiallyyou have connections to London or Kent, show the image to family members and friends who may not have seen it. He must be traced. “We all saw at yesterday evening’s vigil the impact that Sabina’s death has had on the community. “I would reiterate my plea to those in the local area to think andyou have any information that could help this investigation, then please get in touch.”  Hundreds of mourners, including tearful relatives, gathered for an emotional candlelit vigil in memory of Ms Nessa on Friday. Jebina Yasmin Islam, her sister, broke down as she addressed crowds at the vigil. She said: “I just want to say thank you to everyone who came today to show support for my sister. “We have lost an amazing, caring, beautul sister, who left this world far too early.” She added: “Sabina loved her family.  “Words cannot describe how we are feeling, this feels like we are stuck in a bad dream and can’t get out of it – our world is shattered, we are simply lost for words. “No family should go through what we are going through.” Ms Nessa’s uncle Shahin Miah described his niece as “a kind and a open-minded person”, who was “always smiling and helping others”. He said Ms Nessa’s death has “once again brought to the fore the question of women’s safety on the streets”. In his statement, he said: “We don’t want what happened to Sabina to happen to anyone .  “We don’t want any other mother’s chest to be empty or filled with deep sorrow, or to see the tears in the eyes of any father.”The Duchess of Cambridge also described how she was “saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets” on Twitter.OneSpace community centre, which is close to where a dog walker discovered Ms Nessa’s body a week ago, invited members of the community to write tributes to her in a book of condolence as it re-opened on Saturday. The building had been cordoned off by police as they searched the surrounding Cator Park where officers believe Ms Nessa was attacked, and it remained closed until the weekend as a “mark of respect”, the owners said. Ms Nessa had been walking to meet a friend at a pub near her home when she was attacked in Cator Park on September . Her body was discovered by a member of the public the next day, having been hidden under a pile of leaves, it was reported. Two men were separately arrested on suspicion of her murder but were subsequently released under investigation.

In fact, the sad fact is that many of us will dutully separate our plastics from our papers from our general waste - only for our recycling to go straight into landfill due to contamination from items which canapost be recycled. Thataposs why Radio  DJ Sara Cox has teamed up with Co-op on itaposs mission to change the nationaposs recycling habits, by becoming an official recycling behaviour change board member. A survey by the supermarket found that nearly a third of Brits believe they can recycle soft plastics, such as crisp packets and pet food sachets, at home, but oh how wrong they are. And, just to add fuel to the fire, a further  percent just throw in them the recycling bin while unsure whether they can be recycled or not.  In response, the supermarket has launched a nationwide campaign to better educate people on their recycling habits, as well as introducing soft plastic recycling centres in , Co-op stores up and down the UK by November. Thereaposs definitely moments when itaposs dficult to be green, but we all know from watching the news, that we canapost just sit back and think itaposs somebody aposs problem, weaposve all got to do our bit, because itaposs frankly terrying, Sara told the Mirror. The worst thing is feeling powerless, but I feel we do have an amount of power and we do have a little bit of control over our own behaviours. Even prior to joining the campaign, Sara - like many of us - believed that when a load of recycling becomes aposcontaminated,apos it refers to food waste due to cans or jars not being properly cleaned.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. In fact, the worst kind contamination is when the likes of soft plastics become mixed up with hard plastics, because councils donapost have the manpower or the resources to separate the loads before they go in for recycling, meaning it can frequently end up in landfill. While almost all soft plastics end up in landfill, people will now be able to take any of these items to Co-op stores to be recycled. If you scrunch it and it springs back to le a little, that can be recycled at your Co-op, so biscuit wrappers, crisp wrappers, pasta bags, yoghurt pot lids, little sachets of cat food, Sara explained. I think itaposs a lot simpler than trying to read all your packaging, because itaposs very confusing with all the dferent councils and everything.  Sara decided to get involved with the campaign after realising sheaposd become a self-confessed recycling addict a fact she only realised when the option was taken away from her on a recent trip away. I recently went to a lovely little house in Devon and because people down there werenapost really recycling properly, they binned off the recycling and just put everything in the bin instead, she recalled. All of us there on the holiday struggled with it, we really hated it really, because it just felt so old fashioned. With supermarket giants like Co-op providing these initiatives, it certainly makes it a lot easier for consumers to be able to do their bit when it comes to being green, but Sara says itaposs up to everyone - businesses and consumers alike - to make sure weaposre making real change. I feel like we all need to muck in really. I think companies are starting to listen and the big supermarkets are now trying their best to use less plastic and trying interesting new ways of packaging up their food and I think the responsibility sort of lies with all of us, she said. Sara is a member of Co-op’s Behaviour Change Board, on a mission to find out how everyone can build better recycling habits at home, live more sustainably, and do their bit for the environment.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

I was really delighted this morning to see an arrest has been made.” Ms Gibbs fears some people are forgetting that there is a family grieving losing a much loved sister and daughter at the core of a case promoting global discussion about wider issues. She added: “At the moment, we need to focus on the fact there is a family who has lost someone. Changes will come later. “All this political stuff and organisations capitalising on it is just really not needed right now and it is wrong at this time. It is too soon. Barely a week has passed. “This is a time for us to remember Sabina, not blaming or politics. Let’s respect the family. Let’s focus on Sabina and her loved ones.” Meanwhile police have said the man arrested in East Sussex today is a -year-old man. On Thursday evening, investigators released CCTV images of a man they urgently wished to speak to, and one of a silver car they believed he had access to. The Met said on Saturday evening that the balding man is believed to have been carrying a reflective red object that he may have been trying to conceal up his sleeve. He was captured on CCTV as he walked through Pegler Square in Kidbrooke, south-east London, where Ms Nessa had been heading on the evening she died. Scotland Yard would not confirmthe suspect was the man in the footage. Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said: Sabinaaposs family have been informed of this signicant development and they continue to be supported by specialist officers. Two other men aged  and  were previously arrested and released under investigation. Today a car thought to be connected to the inquiry was taken from a compound in Eastbourne used by Sussex Police.

So many of us have done some research into how we can get rid of them and, for instance, bought plants that help keep them away as a result.While they are actually a type of crane fly according to the Wildle Trust, daddy long legs are often incorrectly believed to be spiders because of their long legs.And an expert has now explained why we shouldnapost kill daddy long legs even though so many people are scared by them. Although slightly annoying, this type of crane fly is completely harmless and doesnapost bite like some spiders, as reported by CoventryLive.Karl Curtis, director of reserves and community engagement at Warwickshire Wildle Trust, said: They are out this time of year because basically, they are hatching out of our lawns and ious places - they live a lot of their lives underground as a grub, as a larva, and then what they do is they hatch out over the summer. Probably now is the last throw of the dice, and what they do is they come out and looking to mate, lay eggs back into vegetation and then they die off.  He added: They often get confused with spiders but theyaposre not, theyaposre flies, theyaposre really good food source for birds, theyaposre really important to play their part so people should let them out their windows and not kill them. Mr Curtis also said that things like fly sprays are bad for the environment and other living things so should be avoided. And he noted that crane flies are in fact not poisonous, contrary to popular belief and shouldnapost be feared. What do you think about this story  Sign in and let us know in the comments below  He argued they have probably got a reputation for being poisonous as people mistakenly think they are cellar spiders. The very long spindly spiders that you get in the corners of your room, theyaposre called cellar spiders, those do pack a punch, but they are not dangerous to humans, he said. [Crane flies] theyaposre absolutely harmless. While the female has a point on the end of her abdomen, thataposs to lay eggs, itaposs not a stinger.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirrorHe went on: The reason they come into the house is for warmth and they are attracted to light sothe lights are on in the house they come inside, and they hatch out in the darker hours to avoid being eaten by birds. Theyaposre not looking for shelter, theyaposre out looking for a mate and then looking to lay eggs, they end up in houses because their favourite habitat is short grass and we have lawns.

After lockdown the scenes were more wild than everStudents headed out for the final night of Freshers Week on Saturday Image: NB PRESS LTDByTim Hanlon:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsStudents showed no signs of flagging as they went out partying on Saturday at the end of a wild booze-fuelled Freshersapos Week. Pubs and clubs around the country were full as students dressed up and headed out for another night of partying for the first week of university for students. After the long lockdown and social distancing, the youngsters have finally been able to go out and enjoy themselves - with many not holding back. Many could be seen in the street, some posing for photos while others took the opportunity to enjoy a night out with their friends, and make new ones.  There was plenty of hugging, dancing and group-selfies from students - who were relieved to party once again after more than  months of restrictions. Numerous photos have emerged from the week of partying across the UK. One pic showed a woman seemingly trying to do a limbo dance before she performs a handstand in the street with people looking on laughing.  Groups of friends looked like they’d made plenty of effort to get dressed up for the night as they pouted for selfies. They were all smiles for the camera with one group of men dressing up as women and another pic showed a lad being pushed down the street in a shopping trolley. With the end of Freshers week, the students will begin lectures and their studies in the coming days.  It is a very dferent scene to last year when nightclubs were closed and student le meant there was no chance to go out and socialise. While the pandemic isn’t over and there needs to be caution, it didn’t stop the students this time from having fun. From the high spirits on show, it looked like the students were making up for lost time.  All week students have been pictured out in the streets with plenty of smiles early on in the night and many looking disheveled several hours later. There were images of people downing bottles of spirits and some lying on the pavement being looked after by friends Freshersapos Week is often a lively time at university with some students away from home for the first time but this year it may well have been the wildest yet as they let their hair down.

Dan headed to the National Driving Centre in Croydon, South London, where trainees can drive trucks of up to  tons and . metres. And our man admitted: “It was terrying. We’re only driving around a quiet car park, but the stress of being in control of such a massive vehicle with other cars, people and buildings around is enough to make me glad we’re not out on the road. “When I set off going backwards in the NCA’s articulated lorry, I’m a shambles, struggling to keep the lorry straight.  “Even crawling is an overwhelming exercise in concentration. “I managed to inch the lorry into the bay but I’m horried to see how close I am to the barrier. I think it’s saferI stick to my day job.” Dan’s experience came as firms are trying to fill , vacancies. The Government today sets out a visa scheme allowing , foreign truckers to work in the UK temporarily. And the Department of Transport has simplied HGV testing in a bid to fast-track , lorry-driving rookies into jobs before Christmas. For example, reversing exercises have been cut from the main test as a time-saver. Kate Gibbs, of the Road Haulage Association, said: “Safety has to be paramount. It’s inevitable accidents will happen and we have to do all we can to make sure that that doesn’t happen.”  Victoria Lebrec lost her left leg when she was knocked off her bicycle by an HGV in . Now head of policy at the RoadPeace campaign group, Victoria, , warned: “More people will be killed and seriously injuredroad safety is compromised. “This feels like something that has been rushed through in reaction to an economic issue and I’m worried it has not been properly considered.” Laurence Bolton, of the National Driving Centre, said it was “a huge ask” to expect ordinary drivers to master lorry driving without proper experience.

The September mini-heatwave is due to give way to something much colder and ­wetter, with hail and thunder even predicted in some parts of the UK on Monday. Most of us have enjoyed glorious sunrises recently, like the one in Baldersdale, Co Durham , yesterday.

Sunday will be slightly cloudier but the temperature will otherwise remain around C in most places. The western parts of England and the whole of Wales could see some cloud and potential rain on Saturday morning before it brightens up in the afternoon with highs of C.  This could take a turn on Sunday with some heavy showers in the South East. North-western Scotland meanwhile will be windy in the morning on Saturday before becoming a mainly dry day with some bright or sunny spells developing and highs of C. Sunday will be largely dry and bright with strong southerly winds around the coast. The weather will take a turn on Monday, with the Met Office predicting next week to be the start of autumnal weather.It comes as people have been warned by the AA to not top up their cars outside of their normal routines ahead of planning any potential weekend trips away to take advantage of the weather. Nicky Maxey, for the Met Office, said: Youaposre much more likely to see highs of  degrees more widely but we could see some spots reaching highs of  or C.  It will be similar on Sunday, with places such as Lincolnshire potentially seeing similar temperatures, but still the higher temperatures being in isolated pockets rather than widespread.

But we have got a cold front moving in to Northern Ireland and Scotland on Sunday and then crossing from east to west of the UK on Monday. Thataposs bringing some potentially heavy rain. Thereaposs still some sunshine scattered round on Monday but we could see heavier showers. Hail and thunder is also a risk to the North and West, so Monday heralds a real change towards the autumnal-style weather. Weather forecast for Saturday: Starting rather cloudy with occasional drizzle or rain in the west, especially northwestern Scotland where it will also become increasingly windy. Some sunny intervals likely where. Very warm in sunshine. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Still warm for many on Sunday, some heavy showers in the South East.

Holly McGuire, , was put into an induced coma and given just a % chance of survival after contracting the virus. She needed a tube inserted into her windpipe to help her breath and spent six weeks in hospital fighting for her le. Now she is urging everyone of all ages to get the jab, saying: “It could save your le. Never take le for granted. This can happen to anyone – including you. “I was an anti-vaxxer, I was ­unvaccinated. Now I can honestly tell people Covid is real.  “Please, everyone, ignore the nonsense some people are spouting, get the jab. “Luckily for me I have lived to tell my story. But I nearly died twice. “My husband Steve was told to prepare for the worst. He phoned my mum in tears saying it didn’t look like I would make it.” Holly, who appeared in the TV series Footballers Wives in , said she battled double pneumonia and her lung collapsed while she was in hospital.She spent two weeks in a coma, missing her daughter Madison’s ­seventh birthday, and due to breathing ­dficulties caused by the coronavirus she also had a tracheotomy. What do you think of this story  Join the debate in our comments  Holly, from Grays, Essex, but now living in Marbella, Spain, said: “I have a healthy diet, don’t party, hardly drink and don’t smoke. I thought, ‘This disease won’t affect me’. “A lot of my friends were anti-vaxxers, campaigning against the jab, and I was listening to them, too. “People were saying we won’t know for yearsthe jab is reliable and seeing news reports from back home I didn’t feel reassured by the UK Government. “I thought there were so many reasons not to have it. “I now regret that so much. I made so many excuses not to have it, but when I caught Covid it was dreadful, it hit me like a truck. Just get vaccinated as soon as possible.” Holly tested ­positive for Covid on July  and spent  days isolating at home.

But it was the reason why one particular child couldn’t focus that changed everything for deputy head-teacher Rebekah Wilson.“A boy in my class didn’t seem his normal happy self and he couldn’t concentrate for scratching his stomach,” says -year-old Rebekah, known as Bex. “He told me he didn’t have a bed at home, and the cushion he shared with his brother to sleep on was infested with bed bugs.”This was the moment that Bex, who works at an inner city primary school in Leeds, realised the impact that hygiene could have on her pupils and their education. “Times are hard for some families who are having to choose what they can do without,” she says. “Hygiene items often get sacriced. We’re not talking luxuries here, just the absolute basics like toilet roll, shampoo, deodorant, shower gel and soap. “Going without these things affects kids’ self-esteem. Imagine what it’s likeyou can’t keep yourself clean or you don’t have clean clothes  It can really stop children learning, engaging and taking part at school and it can lead to bullying or them being singled out.” Happily there’s an organisation that’s helping to relieve the pressure. The Hygiene Bank, which stresses that being clean is a basic human right, collects new, unused, in-date personal care and household cleaning essentials and distributes them to families in need through schools like Bex’s and charities.  And Boots has been supporting The Hygiene Bank by hosting more than  banks in stores across the UK where customers can donate their own hygiene products. The retailer then donates four products for every kilogram that has been donated. Toothbrushes and toothpaste are two items Bex knows are particularly needed. “So many children are coming to school with tooth problems now,” she says. “Bad dental health can cause a lot of pain and distress and really affect children’s confidence.” But something as simple as shampoo or shower gel can also improve the wellbeing and happiness of those struggling to stay afloat. “I had a mum in tears the other day because we’d given her a hygiene package that included some shower gel. As little as a p bottle can make a dference. She said it felt like Christmas.” Another mum had just £ left for her weekly shopping. “She needed nappies, washing powder and washing up liquid. She didn’t know what to buy because she knew she couldn’t get it all.” Hygiene products provided through The Hygiene Bank across the UK help fill the gap. “We all deserve a certain minimum,” says Bex. “We need to ensure every family has access to these basics, and remove the stigma of asking for support, making sure that families are treated with respect.” Boots leads big donation drive Boots and charity The Hygiene Bank are working together to provide much-needed hygiene and personal care products to people living in poverty.  In the last year, Boots, which has more than  donation points in stores across the UK, has given more than , items – from toothpaste to shower gel, soap to shampoo – to hundreds of communities and charities across the UK. Boots donates hygiene products to The Hygiene Bank. And since it believes every child has the right to feel good when they go back to school, Boots has also worked with the charity to design educational resources for parents and teachers to help young people understand hygiene and hygiene poverty. In its ‘You donate  we donate’ initiative, Boots gives four products for every kilogram of items donated to The Hygiene Bank in Boots stores.You can donate at your local Boots donation point, through the boots e-voucher scheme, and directly to The Hygiene Bank. Products are distributed to those who need them via schools, charities, council services and voluntary organisations.

It all got a bit heated.I was prepared to be called a hypocrite, a fascist and to be asked why I don’t go to China to be shot at . I’ve been managing quite well during the last few weeks to stay calm during the barrage of questions that have been coming my way. People have been quite rightly furious and upset by what we are doing and I accept that. What frustrated me on Wednesday was the refusal by the other people on the programme to accept the physical reality we are in. The reality that Sir David King means when he says, “What we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity”. That’s the reason I’m on the telly sitting through that rage and anger. It is because I really care about the country I live in and all the people who live here. Do you agree with Insulate Britainaposs actions  Have your say in the comments below  What the GMB presenters are not ready to accept is that climate breakdown isn’t primarily about survival of polar bears and dolphins, as important as they are, but about the survival of our economy, our NHS and of the very fabric of our society. This means many people will suffer.  What Insulate Britainis asking for is to conserve our society. To do that at this time means having to make some tough decisions, we understand that. The comparisons to Churchill on the programme upset Richard Madeley. I wasn’t saying that IB were the same as Churchill, what I was saying was that there were some similarities. The people that didn’t want to oppose Hitler were seen as appeasing Hitler. Churchill understood that you either faced up to the reality now or you paid for it later. He had the support of just six MPs. That meant that  million people lost their lives. It was locked in. There is a similarity now. If we don’t move as rapidly as Sir David King says we should, the suffering of millions of people in the next few decades will be locked in, unstoppable. What was happening on GMB on Wednesday was appeasement. A refusal to accept the reality, while also turning their anger of that reality onto me. Well we feel angry too. Angry that our government has ignored our letters, petitions and protests for  years.Insulating our homes is our line in the sand and we will not let them cross it. It gives the best value for money in terms of CO emissions, will provide hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs and will stop tens of thousands of our elderly from freezing to death each winter and means families can heat and eat. This isnapost aboutmy home is insulated or not. Itaposs not about whether Iaposm a hypocrite for calling for all homes to be insulated. Itaposs about how tackling the climate crisis will not only save our country from destruction, but also benefit millions of our citizens and bring them out of fuel poverty. Itaposs a win-win. What Richard and Susanna don’t seem to understand is thatthe government continues to ignore us, it will get much more heated.

At the time this picture was taken, she had spent  hours straight trying to catch a small fly in her bedroom with a hoover Image: Vanessa WardByEstel Farell-Roig:,  Sep | commentsA woman suffering with severe OCD has opened up about what le is like for her. Vanessa Ward doesnapost leave her bedroom and has been in solitary confinement for the past decade, with the simplest of tasks such as brushing her teeth taking her  minutes.The -year-old has said she feels like an empty vessel and that she is being assassinated every minute of every hour by OCD , describing the disorder as an endless stream of constant torture. Ms Ward, from Castlewellan in County Down, Northern Ireland, said she has always suffered with OCD but was able to have a semblance of a normal le up until  years ago. Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror She said: For the past decade, however, my le is now dictated solely by OCD - I have no le outside of it. I have lost my twenties to this debilitating illness. I have been in solitary confinement for  years and I havenapost left my bedroom. My days are spent between a bedroom and an en-suite and I have become totally isolated from all close friends and family. I am totally alone because of it and have nearly died from the isolation and loneliness OCD brings more than once. Ms Ward - who is now trying to raise funds for a specialist treatment - wrote on her GoFundMe page that her movements are now so complex and calculated that she is like in a catatonic state.I have set rules and complex rituals that must be carried out in a systematic, orderly and symmetrical way, she continued. If I donapost do this the thoughts, anxiety, nausea and terror are so much of a punishment I have no option but to comply. I do these rituals all day, every day to the point I faint on a very regular basis. I have stopped eating for weeks and on three occasions my family have had no option but have me admitted to acute mental health hospitals. On the second admission, my health was so critical that I was sectioned under the mental health act.Ms Ward - who is one of five siblings - said that her mental health has led to a deterioration in her physical health as well, going from  stone to nine stone within a year as a result of the anti-psychotic drugs that were tried during a hospital admission.She also has changes in her eyesight and suffers from hair loss and fractured teeth, together with deficiencies in potassium, folic acid, and vitamin D. While most adults having a resting heart rate between  and bpm, Ms Ward said hers is around bpm. I never get a break from the constant torture and thoughts of OCD, she continued. I can go for periods of  hours with no sleepOCD dictates it. My le has been so miserable - I have just been existing and I feel like an empty vessel. After several admissions to acute hospitals where no one could help me I just felt like dying - I wanted to die. Death is easier than this endless stream of constant torture and feeling like I am being assassinated every minute of every hour by OCD. I wanted euthanasia almost daily but my family kept trying to tell me it will get better.  Ms Wardaposs sister Priscilla said that, as a family, they can see the endless ways OCD has ruined her le. The -year-old said her sister is isolated from the outside world - with no personal relationships or any friendships - and can no longer do the simplest of things. Ms Ward now lives in a house on her own, she explained, with family members visiting her every day to bring her food and encourage her to eat.  The eldest sister said: She has been sick for so long she is now hyper sensitive to sounds and smells. A simple smoke alarm gives her an anxiety attack to the level she feels she would take a heart attack. There is no enjoyment in her le anymore and she has nothing to look forward to. She is a prisoner in her own mind. She is also painfully aware how absurd her behaviours and rituals are but OCD always over rides this and she must comply. Ms Ward said her sisteraposs OCD is a never ending cycle of floods of thoughts that cause endless anxiety and,the ritual isnapost completed, the thoughts and anxiety wonapost stop.  As the years have gone on, these rituals have become longer and more complex, she continued, to the point her sister now spends every hour of every day carrying these out. Ms Ward said her sister is crippled and completely disabled by OCD now, adding the picture of her in the bedroom was taken as she spent  hours straight trying to catch a small fly in her bedroom with the hoover. This was without a break, drink of water or sleep, she continued. Complete adrenaline caused by fear keeps this going. We, as a family, canapost even help in a scenario like this becausewe enter the bedroom we have now contaminated it and she would have to do endless streams of rituals to the point were she would be so exhausted and weak she would be fainting. We constantly feel useless, guilty, worried, hopeless, powerless and heart broken. The sister said her mum thinks Vanessa was born with OCD, not wanting to be touched or cuddled since she was a baby. Ms Ward said the OCDaposs symptoms started to accentuate when her sister was a teenager, for instance taking six hours to have a shower. Planning on an IT career, Ms Ward said her sister has only ever had a couple of summer jobs in between school years. She added: We canapost remember the last time we gave Vanessa a hug, gave her a gt, celebrated her birthday, heard her genuinely laugh or that contagious smile and care free attitude she had. Our Christmases now are opening presents without her, not having her at the dinner. We are all together while she has been sitting alone in a room or sitting in a mental health hospital listening to other patients screaming. A family gatherings or weddings, again we have the guilt and sadness that she isnapost there and is alone suffering endlessly. When wider family members inevitably ask how she is, we are all fighting back tears and the happiest of days are always tainted with sadness. She isnapost able to be with us but her tortured face is everywhere we look.  The family is now trying to raise funds for specialist treatment with a world-renowned professor in OCD which would involve staying at a private hospital for at least six months, working daily with professionals carrying out Cognitive Behavioural Therapyand Exposure And Response Prevention . Ms Ward wrote on the GoFundMe page: I had given up all hope until my family came across a world renowned Professor in OCD. They arranged a consultation with him online. He stated that my case is quite the challenge and I was waiting for the inevitable aposI donapost think I can help youapos but to my astonishment, do you know what he said to me  aposVanessa donapost give up hope because I can help youapos. I can not tell you how that felt. I just started crying uncontrollably. I couldnapost even comprehend it. I couldnapost believe it. After years of  hope and constant let downs, he can help me. The Professor has dictated that treatment needs to be started imminently as my condition will continue to plummet. What do you think about this story  Sign in and let us know in the comments below Ms Ward - who hopes to become an ambassador for OCD in the future - has so far been able to raise more than £, but her goal is £,. Her family hopes that the specialist treatment will teach Ms Ward coping mechanisms and tools to manage her OCD, said Priscilla, teaching her to notice for signs of relapse so she can prevent any further deterioration. She added: Medications at present will help to change the chemistry in the brain, but the ERP and CBT will help to change the structural pathways in her brain and how the neuro transmitters communicate. This is the last resort for Vanessa to try and get help, for her to be pulled from the never ending sea of sadness she is drowning in.

Describing how she eradicated the beige, she said that transforming the whole house was so therapeutic. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here She added I thrive working under pressure with big transformation reveals at very little cost. I love the challenging task of working within a budget creating an incredible glow up. My whole house consists of my own handy work and creativity constantly making dramatic changes for less money. We transformed the kitchen by spraying the kitchen units with a deep green acrylic eggshell emulsion and added accent brass detailed knobs. We also completely transformed our fridge. I lightly sanded it back, applied a thick layer of dficult surface primer then painted purple with gold accent feature handles and it still looks incredible. One of Kimaposs favourite transformations was her bed which she totally overhauled using two tins of spray paint for less than £. Kim said: I also created the main light myself with a cheap halo ring light above the bed attaching a double layer of black peacock coloured ostrich feathers. These lights are sold for hundreds of pounds and mine cost me £ to make. I often head to local vintage stores and charity shops treasure spotting.. Itaposs amazing what a bit of spray paint can do! Everything after a bit of love and attention can be transformed into a show-stopping statement piece of decor. Offering her tips, Kim recommended creating a mood board. For successful design, Iaposd recommend gathering samples of materials to create a tactile mood board so you can get a sense and feel of the space you are wishing to transform, she added. Paint large areas of colour swatches on the walls in dferent areas as each angle of every colour reacts dferently depending on the lighting, so can be quite misleading. Fabric swatches are always a good idea then you can sense the mood the material creates with the atmospheric surroundings for the scheme. Recreating my design style would be a case of indulging in maximalist soft furnishings, bold colour and pattern with quirky gold statement accessories. The -year-old said her top tips for decorating would be to go with your own personal design style of what you love and don’t be influenced by other peopleaposs style.

Sabina Nessa, a -year-old teacher, is thought to have been taking a five-minute route through a park at around .pm on a Friday. She did not make it. Her body was found by a passer-by the next day, hidden under a pile of leaves in Cator Park, South East London – just a stone’s throw from her home. Friends and relatives describe Sabina as a beautul soul who was always caring and kind. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said this week that between last year’s International Women’s Day and this year’s,  women in Britain were killed at the hands of men. He warned: We do have an epidemic when it comes to violence against women and girls. As a woman and a mother, I am numb with fear. My first instinct was to promote the importance of personal safety to other women.  I posted a list of the  best apps for women walking alone at night, I reminded women to be vigilant, not to bury their heads in their phones or walk around with earphones in. But that is to ignore the real issue. We do all this as routine – simply because we are women, and we are dying at the hands of men at the horric rate of three a week. It is abhorrent that, because of my gender, I can’t walk the streets with the same confidence a man can. It is abhorrent that I have to put an app on my phone to ensure my husband knows I’m safe. It is abhorrent I have to take my alarm. And it is abhorrent that,it is dark, I feel anxious by myself. ThatI see a man walking towards me I feel vulnerable – so I clutch my bag, quicken my pace and cross the road. Why should I feel like that  Why should any woman have to  So many parents have dropped their daughters off at university this week, my niece being one of them. My sister-in-law gave her the talk all parents of daughters will know: Keep your drink with you so no one spikes it, don’t go anywhere without your phone, always stick together, don’t walk alone and please, please, text me so I know you’re safe. And that was before we heard about Sabina Nessa’s murder. I’m sure that will have led to many frantic texts begging to please be careful, stay safe, don’t walk travel by yourself at night. I don’t want to be repeating all this to my daughter when she goes to university in eight years. I want there to have been signicant changes in how women are treated, so they do not fear for their safety. Some % of women say they feel unsafe or very unsafe walking alone at night in their local area. Just % of men express the same concern. For me, the single biggest change we need is the education of young men on women’s rights, on what misogyny looks and sounds like, on what equality really means. Men have a vital role in combating this. They need to know they can call it out, prevent it and stop it. How the Met Police can claim that London streets are safe beggars belief. They will only be safe when men stop attacking women – and when women can walk without fear.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Murder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The abandoned park - which featured in US television shows including Top Gear America - is currently in a dilapidated state following its permanent closure in .This came after a rocky history including a serious accident that led to a former-employee becoming paralysed, together with three re-opening and subsequent closures.  Seventeen years after it was abandoned, the current state of the former family favourite has been captured in the photographs taken by Shaun, who described the abandoned waterpark as an incredibly surreal scene.

We all have our methods - with some as simple as chucking some frozen roasties in the oven - and thereaposs no shame in that. But the country is united on how they should look at the end - crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Many claim you need goose fat, while others swear you should add semolina for the ultimate crisp. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereNow one food expert has shared her view - after chatting to the Daily Star about the matter. Author Rebecca Wilson, who has , followers on her Instagram account, says you DONaposT need to parboil after all. And you can use goose fat, sunflower oil or olive oil - but look for all-rounder potatoes in the shops, such as Kind Edward, Maris Piper or Rooster Potatoes. She said: When cooking your roast potatoes, make sure you boil them until theyaposre pretty much cooked - donapost parboil them. This will give them a soft texture. After turning off the stove, you should then drain them and let them sit so the moisture can evaporate, then shake them to crisp up the edges. Finally, coat your potatoes in your chosen oil and place them in a hot oven - but donapost forget to turn them over a couple of times. Her cracking recipe for golden roasties is in her new book Family Comforts - which is already been on topping the bestseller list on Amazon. Her book also features quick-cook snacks and midweek meal ideas that can be prepared in minutes. For those looking for something healthier, recipes for delicious treats are included that are low in both salt and sugar but full in flavour, according to Rebecca.

There is, of course, the excitement of bringing a child into the world, mixed with panic, fear, anxiety and pretty much every emotion you can experience. So, you canapost even imagine all the thoughts and feelings that would be flooding through your head after discovering youaposre six months pregnant, without a single warning sign, meaning youaposve only got three months to prep for parenthood. Thataposs exactly what happened to one woman, when she took a random pregnancy test after both her sister and best friend commented on how she seemed aposdferent lately.aposTikTok user Nydia Maritza, who goes by the name of @nydiamv on the app, explained how she wasnapost at all concerned while waiting for the results to show up on the test, cause I was on birth control and had my period three weeks prior, had NO symptoms and wasnapost showing.Three minutes later, however, she saw a huge apos+apos sign pop up on the test, sending her into a panic as she booked an appointment with the doctor for the following week. When she arrived at her appointment, the nurse told Nydia she looked no more than six weeks after pushing on her belly with her hands.

However, after starting the ultrasound, the nurse had to go and get a doctor to confirm that she was, in fact  weeks pregnant, going on , with the scan revealing a whole baby with limbs, toes, facial features etc. Realising I only have three months to mentally, emotionally and physically prepare myself for welcoming a baby Iaposve only known about for  minutes, Nydia added, with a terried expression on her face. In a follow up clip, the mum-of-one shared a series of photos of herself throughout her pregnancy, explaining how her body didnapost change at all until around seven months, when her belly popped aposovernight.apos  Nydia then went on to explain how she pulled a Kylie Jennerby not telling anyone about her pregnancy until her son was born, later sharing an adorable photo of his feet on Facebook.The reason I decided to keep my pregnancy private, aside from close family and friends, was because I only had three months to prepare, emotionally, physically, mentally, the whole shebang, she said. I had to prep the room the nursery, all that kind of stuff and it was a very peaceful three months, Iaposd do it all over againI could.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Ronnie Henry was looking forward to munching down on his smoked ham and mature cheese sub, from Tesco Express in Eastfield, Wolverhampton, when he made the grim discovery. I was horried when I saw it. I took it out of the packaging and for some reason I looked underneath it, not sure what prompted me to do that, he recalled.And there was a piece of brown stuff that literally looks like cat or fox faeces. I got straight in touch with them on Twitter and I’ve taken it back to the store for it to go off to be investigated. After finding the mysterious brown lump, Ronnie took to Twitter to complain, prompting others to suggest it looked like cat s***. Bought a ham and cheese sub from @Tesco, anyone got an idea what the f**k this is that was stuck in the bread  he tweeted. Might be something to do with the bread but looks like cat s**t to me. Straight in the bin.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Cat turd, one wrote, while another added: Looks like cat s*** for f*** sake. In an email to Ronnie, Tesco has since apologised for the mystery finding, and has vowed to investigate how the alleged cat poop made its way into the sandwich and onto store shelves. I am very sorry to learn that you found this inside your sub and I understand the concern caused by this. We take great pride in providing our customers with the best quality of products, so to hear this has disappointed me, they wrote. Again I’m very sorry that this happened and I hope that I’ve been able to help you get this investigated further.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

In another photo from the raucous nightclub, people were left roaring with laughter at two lads who had some bad luck.

Another said: I came here to say this, it’s quite telling of our society that we’ll make fun of a working person that has to pay for their lunch with a collection of small coins, yet would never think of helping that poor guy out.

But, the most part, the majority of people would trust their signicant others with their finances and thataposs how it should be. However, one woman has found herself in an incredibly uncomfortable situation, after she was forced to revoke her own husbandaposs access to her bank account, after he started dipping into her savings. My husband and I have been married for three years. We have two separate bank accounts but both of us know the info of each others bank account, the woman explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum.  My husband is working a good job, gets a lot of money. Iaposm currently on pregnancy leave but I also have a good job as an optometrist. I also have lots of savings on my bank account. All of these details were fine, until the woman recently discovered her husband had deposited around £, out of her savings account, not for himself, but to give to his brother. His brother has a job but refuses to spend his own money and expects his mum and dad to provide for him while he spends money on games and stuff like that, the woman continued. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.  Apparently my brother-in-law owed some people £, and despite the fact he had that amount in his own bank account he asked my husband for money. My husband not only gave him money, but got my own savings from my own bank account without asking me first. But, asthat wasnapost bad enough, when she confronted her husband about what heaposd done, he ran back to his parents, who then called the woman to tell her sheaposs an entitled a**hole to make such a big deal out of £, when my parents are rich and that amount is insignicant to me. The womanaposs husband has since hit out at her for revoking his access to her savings, prompting the woman to turn to Reddit to question whether she handled the situation in the right way. Your husband has shown two major, marriage risking behaviours. One he broke your trust by stealing from your personal account. He didn’t ask youyou’d want to help the brother, he didn’t use his own money, and he didn’t even tell you what he did on his own. He knew it was wrong and did it anyways, one Reddit user commented. Two, he sided with his family against you rather than deal with the problem with you directly. I think your marriage has hit a major crisis and this should not be swept under the rug. Another agreed: He STOLE from you. If he canapost see what he did wrong this is a major warning of things to come. He needs to pay it pack and go to therapy, or you need to leave. Do not sweep this under the rug. Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Very risky,” the anonymous pilot said. “Those Brisbane videos are insane. We could never do something like that.” Others suggested that the flight was not actually as risky as it looks at first, with the angle of the video giving the impression itaposs closer to the buildings than it is.  Australian reporter Chad Ryan said: “It’s not immediately discernible in the angle in this video, but that plane is flying above a river that runs through the city. Not weaving in between buildings. Also it was widely publicised before it occurred so people weren’t caught off guard. The Australian air force carried out two flypasts, with one at , feet and the other as low as  feet at points.

The company’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said a boost in vaccine production should mean enough jabs for “everyone on this Earth” by the middle of next year. He said booster shots would be available soon, as would jabs for infants. With the vaccine industry as a whole expanding production, “enough doses should be available by the middle of next year so that everyone on this Earth can be vaccinated”, he said. Mr Bancel added: “Those who do not get vaccinated will immunise themselves naturally, because the Delta iant is so contagious. He continued to the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung : “In this way we will end up in a situation similar to that of the flu. You can either get vaccinated and have a good winter. Or you donapost do it and risk getting sick and possibly even ending up in hospital.Asked whether that could spell a “ to normal” next year, he replied: “As of today, in a year, I assume.”According to figures published by Our World In Data, . per cent of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. In low-income countries, only . per cent of people have received at least one dose, while countries with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated more than  times faster. On Tuesday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres slammed wealthy countries for hoarding jabs and called on the world to “wake up” to the greatest “cascade of crises” in our letime. “A majority of the wealthier world vaccinated. Over  per cent of Africans still waiting for their first dose,” he said. “This is a moral indictment of the state of our world. It is an obscenity.” Colombian President Ivan Duque joined Mr Guterres’ calls at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, and said the international community must equitably distribute jabs to avoid the creation of new, more fearsome iants of the coronavirus.“It is our moral duty,” he said during his speech to the th assembly on Tuesday. Some countries have acquired enough doses for six or seven times their population and have announced third booster doses, he added, while others have not been able to administer any shots. In the UK, booster jabs are currently being offered to the over-s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers.

Nemi Chand, , was asleep last Thursday night, in Malwara village, in Rajasthan, northern India, when he felt a slight pain and thought it was the animal scratching at his side to wake him. Astonishingly, the man didnapost think his bullet wound was anything more than a scratch and he is lucky to be alive. He has admitted that he was in discomfort but he thought the pain was due simply to a pet cat clawing at him and the scratch on his body appeared to him to look the same. The bullet had incredibly entered his body below the rib-cage and avoided all his vital organs.  Police have been investigating what happened with the man asleep at the time of the shooting. The electrical lineman simply ignored the injury and had no idea it was actually a bullet penetrating his body. He was sleeping in a room with three other linemen after checking some faulty lines together but none of them heard the gun go off. Seven hours later, a friend discovered an empty bullet shell and with the pain not going away, Nemi also realised that he must have had something more than just a cat scratch. At this point he decided to go to hospital and found out that it was actually a bullet An X-ray revealed the bullet lodged under Nemi’s skin had just avoided his vital organs and he was taken into surgery to have it removed under general anesthetic on Friday morning. Footage taken inside the operating theatre shows a surgeon prising open Nemi’s skin to pop out the stubborn bullet. Orthopedic surgeons Vardharam Dewasi and Narseeram are then seen thoroughly washing out the wound with sterilising fluid to prevent infection.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people. Participants will discover traditional building skills, learn how to guide visitors, or #takeover# the social media accounts for a museum: all with the aim of improving their future employability.The project, which runs until May , has three main strands of work: providing work experience placements for young people aged - who will study for a Trinity College Arts Award accredited workshops and events and a series of school visits.For more information, contact project co-ordinators Kirsty MacNabat kirsty@chartsargyllandisles.org or Pamela Campbellat pamela@chartsargyllandisles.org.Seymour Adams, Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles Board"},{"url":null,"title":"fiona celebrates double wins","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLochgilphead golfer Fiona McLeod completed a unique double, winning Dunaverty Golf Club#s R.N.L.I Open Event with a net score of .Fiona#s victory added to her previous success in winning Dunty#s Holiday Open back in July with a net score of .

St Peter#sSt Peter#s win - on penaltiesRed Star welcomed St Peter#s to the Ropework last Saturday for their Scottish Cup first round tie and were disappointed to exit the competition after an even contest ended - after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Our key workers continue to work flat-out and have sadly faced much abuse from people due to shortages and delays.Everyone has worked hard to ensure people have had their needs and wants met.It is annoying when we cannot have what we want we have become accustomed to getting everything we want and in quick time.We forget to be grateful for what we have, to be mindful that we are fortunate to have access to so much, even when not everything we want is available.Watching the news from Afghanistan and countries struggling with hurricanes, fire and drought reminds us how fortunate we are.I wonder what you are most grateful for over this past summer What one memory would you choose to carry with you and savour over the coming months As some of our churches prepare for harvest, we will be thinking of all we are thankful for and we will be remembering those less fortunate with our gts.Perhaps you would like to find out more about what your local church is doing.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

Healthy trees are being protected during the works and will remain.The same stone recently used to resurface Colchester Square # Achnaba stone quarried locally by MacLeod Construction Ltd # will be installed on the new public square area, with electrical installation for the square also anticipated in the autumn.The historic drinking fountain close to the public toilet block has been dismantled, to be reinstated later in the project.The front green scheme is expected to be complete by early .Lochgilphead is also seeing investment in shop front improvements, supported by the council, and the town centre Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme is just getting underway.Structural and service works are almost complete as part of a redevelopment of Mid Argyll Community Pool by owner Mid Argyll Community Enterprises Ltd , allowing fit-out and finishing over the next couple of months.MacLeod Construction Ltd began work in March on the MACPool Activity Hub which, when completed, will offer soft play, an all-access café and multi-use rooms for hire in addition to improved changing facilities for the pool.The project, due for completion in October, is going to plan despite materials supply challenges faced by the building industry.Unforeseen complications in the build have also caused minor delays, but MacLeod Construction is finding ways around these hurdles and the MACEL Board is hopeful that swimmers can be welcomed back by the second half of December.All aspects of the new Activity Hub should be up and running early next year, and MACPool manager Fiona MacAlpine is going to be recruiting some new team members in the coming weeks.MACEL chair Kim Ritchie said: #Thanks to the many organisations and iniduals who have supported the project financially, all funds for the main build and basic fit-out of the Hub are in place.#But there is still a need for funds to complete the fit-out and landscape and furnish the external area.#Soyou haven’t yet contributed and would like to # it’s not too late.There are two community sponsorship schemes, one for local businesses and one for iniduals – the Sponsor Our Seascape program. Just email redevelopment@macpool.org.uk for more details.Kim added: #Everyone at MACPool is really looking forward to the re-opening and to welcoming all MACPool’s customers, old and new, to the new Hub. If you would like to hear more about the project, please come along to the AGM on October .#It was an exciting time for everyone connected with Kilmartin Museum as concrete was poured last week for a new museum building.For the past  years the museum has inspired people by interpreting, explaining and conserving the internationally-important archaeological landscape, artefacts and natural heritage of Kilmartin Glen.But it has outgrown its surroundings so after a fundraising campaign a major extension, designed by award-winning architects Reiach and Hall, was started on site in April .The build and fit-out is expected to be completed early in , with a view to opening the new museum galleries in March .The redevelopment will provide more exhibition space, a creative space, an accessible research and learning facility and a new education space.Mid Argyll Youth Development Serviceshas said it is #delighted# that work has started on the next phase of a wheel-park and outdoor development in Lochgilphead.The project is being funded by Renewi and Argyll and Bute Council through the Scottish Landfill Communities Fund.Funding of £, through the Scottish Landfill Communities Fund will allow the levelling of the site # beside the MAYDS building on Union Street # in preparation for building, along with security fencing and the start of a community garden.DA MacDonald contractors are undertaking this work, and MAYDS manager Fiona Kalache said: #Huge thanks to it for its support, advice and efficient service.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white

The Second World War brought a new awareness of physical fitness, survival skills and mountain warfare and the corresponding legacy of innovation provided great benefits to climbing and mountaineering equipment. After the darkness of the war years nothing seemed impossible ndash it was a time of opportunity, and a young man from Gatehouse of Fleet epitomised that period more than anyone .The immediate post-war years gave Hamish MacInnes a robust  from which to launch a unique career that would see him become a world-class mountaineer, a successful equipment designer and manufacturer, a film-maker, a prolic author and a world-acknowledged mountain rescue pioneer.Written and compiled before his death at the age of  last year, MacInnes: The Fox of Glencoe chronicles many of Hamishrsquos epic and far-flung adventures, offering the reader a portal into the mind of one of the great Scots of our time. A solo ascent of the Matterhorn in Switzerland at the age of  and epic mountaineering exploits in the Alps, the Dolomites and further afield in the Himalaya, South America, New Zealand and the US, all starkly portray the uncompromising nature of MacInnes the mountaineer, but itrsquos the chapters on his ice axe and mountain rescue designs and inventions, his love of fast cars and motorbikes, his film-making successes and friendships with celebrities like Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery, Robert de Niro and Michael Palin and the building of a log cabin, without planning permission, on a roadless stretch of Torridon coastline, that fill in some of the crevasses in this incredible story of a well known, but very private inidual.Born in , Hamish was introduced to climbing at the age of  when his family moved to Greenock and he noticed one of his neighbours heading off on his motorbike every weekend. On discovering the neighbour was a climber Hamish went along as a pillion passenger and rapidly became one of the most prolic mountaineers in Scotland.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Hamish MacInnes relaxing on top of Ben Nevis. \" class\"editor-image\"Hamish MacInnes relaxing on top of Ben Nevis. A meeting with an inexperienced and precocious -year old Chris Bonington, resulted in the pair climbing Agagrsquos Groove, Ravenrsquos Gully and Crowberry Ridge Direct on the Buachaille Etive Mor, all in full winter conditions, an experience that laid the foundations for Sir Chris Boningtonrsquos own brilliant mountaineering career.Bonington recalls that first meeting with the -year-old MacInnes in his autobiography, I Chose to Climb: ldquoHamish MacInnes, already a legendary figure in Scottish circles hellipwas only in his early s. He had started climbing as a lad, hitch-hiked to the Alps just after the war with only pound in his pocket and had spent his National Service in Austria. There he had earned the nickname lsquoMacPitonrsquo, having acquired a taste for peggingfrom the Austrians, on the steep limestone walls of the Kaisergebirge.ldquoIn the early s the use of any articial aids was still frowned on, but Hamish hammered his pegs into Scottish crags with gay abandon, much to the disgust of the staider members of the Scottish Mountaineering Club. This never worried him, however, for he had a complete disregard for public opinion and was in every respect an inidualist.It was that iniduality that set MacInnes apart. He always did his own thing, ploughed his own furrow, although he did accept an invitation to become a member of the Clydebank-based Creagh Dhu Mountaineering Club. ldquoAlthough I had to dig deep into my memory of over four-score years, he wrote, ldquothe time I spent with the Creagh Dhu Club was probably the most memorable of my le, and I was lucky to have such excellent teachers to show me the ropes.Many of Hamishrsquos first ascents were with either Bill Smith or John Cunningham, shipyard workers who were amongst the leading climbers of that generation, but, ldquoas a rule we never bagged summits after climbing, for fear that we would be classed as Munroists. That was for jessies!The meeting with Bonington was an auspicious one. In the years that followed the pair climbed successfully together in the Alps and ultimately in the Himalaya when MacInnes became Boningtonrsquos depute leader on the successful  Everest South-West Face expedition. On that expedition Dougal Haston and Doug Scott became the first Brits to climb the worldrsquos highest mountain, but by then MacInnes was an Everest veteran. He had attempted to climb Everest in the early s with John Cunningham. In complete contrast to Boningtonrsquos mammoth military-style expedition, MacInnesrsquos attempt had a team of two, a bag of tatties and a sheep. The pair had emigrated to New Zealand on a pound assisted immigration passage and then travelled home overland via India and Nepal, with a frustrated ultra-lightweight attempt at Everest en route.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Hamish MacInnes at the age of , inspecting a modern MacInnes Stretcher \" class\"editor-image\"Hamish MacInnes at the age of , inspecting a modern MacInnes Stretcher Hamish MacInnes went on to found both the Search and Rescue Dog Association and the Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team. His revolutionary MacInnes Stretcher is still used by rescue teams throughout the world, and his original all-metal ice axe changed the face and nature of winter mountaineering. He was also a prolic author, publishing  books, including the seminal International Mountain Rescue Handbookand the classic Call Out , in which he recalled his experiences with the Glencoe Mountain Rescue team.Other publications included a set of walking guidebooks, a book about his Alsatian rescue dogs, and a handful of novels."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13029382.jpg?type=article-full","title":"manic-street-preacher-nicky-wire-bands-new-album-love-abba","story":"Nicky Wire, lyricist, bassist, sometime controversialist, long-time ABBA fan and, alongside guitarist and vocalist James Dean Bradfield and drummer Sean Moore, effectively letime member of Manic Street Preachers, thinks about the question for a moment before answering.ldquoI donrsquot think we have, he says finally. ldquoSean had a phase ndash this must be  years ago ndash when he spent a lot of money on cars. Hersquod never learnt to drive, and he always wanted to. And he turned up in a  Porsche and I accidentally opened the door straight onto a stone pillar.ldquoFair play, he forgave me.Itrsquos midday on Monday, a few days after the release of The Ultra Vivid Lament, the th Manic Street Preachers album, and a few days before it will go to number one in the album charts, beating off the challenge of Steps.The band celebrating their new album reaching number one in the album chartsWire is sitting in his home in Newport, South Wales, surrounded by a couple of guitars, a piano, a drum kitand a lot of vinyl. His mood, he says, is somewhere in the region of subdued optimism.ldquoThe album is selling well surprisingly because hellip He pauses. ldquoWho can tell about anything  I used to think I had a vague sense of judging the atmosphere, but not anymore. To be honest, culture-stroke-music is so vital at the moment, so to be part of it to be asked to do interviews and to be played on the radio when yoursquore on your th album, is quite a big achievement.That the Manics are still in existence more than  years since they crashed into the public consciousness as glammed-up generation terrorists back at the fag end of the s and despite losing key member Richey Edwards when he went missing in , is testament to their working-class work ethic and perhaps a strand of stubborn contrarianism.If the punky thrash of their early singles and the intensity and nihilism of their Holy Bible years has long given way to a comfortable classic rock setting , The Ultra Vivid Lament is still a confident example of what that might mean.Read More: James Dean Bradfield on Victor Jara and the r eturn of the ManicsIt has arrived trailing namechecks for ABBA, Echo and the Bunnymen and even The Associatesamongst its influences.ldquoI think this album certainly feels like Waterloo in rsquo, rsquo, right through to Bring On the Dancing Horses in rsquo by Echo and the Bunnymen. Thatrsquos the sort of musical framework, Wire agrees.ldquoBecause James learnt the piano and wrote literally all the music on piano I think the ABBA influence in particular just seemed to come out really naturally.Yes, he says, he has heard the new ABBA album. ldquoI was really impressed that it sounded like ABBA. Sometimes the mistake you can make when yoursquove been away is actually not sounding like you did before.He loves the fact that their new music remains ldquosumptuous, seductive and quite cold. The way they sing is never over the top, itrsquos not scales going mad. Itrsquos always really controlled, and I really appreciate that.Controlled is a good word for the new Manics album too. It is the sound of a band who know exactly what theyrsquore for. But that title, Nicky, what are you lamenting ldquoI lost both my parents, so that does hang over the album. It was lamenting losing something really precious hellip the warmth that I had with the parents I had. The one thing Irsquom more grateful than anything for is growing up with my mum and dad and my brother, and just looking back with such warmth and kindness. But obviously that comes with a huge void as well.The Manics play Scotland next weekInevitably ageing and mortality, then, had a bearing on the album the band has created.ldquoIt sounds a bit old-fashioned but hellip We looked at ourselves and thought creativity is the only thing wersquove got left. We were all  at the same time with family and kids and everything , parents getting older and passing away and all that. It really flowed from there.It is the work of people who have known each other basically all their lives, he points out. ldquoI was in the same class as James at school from the age of four and a half. We were in school together and then we were in a band. Itrsquos probably not that healthy really. And James and Sean are cousins. Itrsquos a bit of a Hollywood story, really, all in the same comprehensive, including Richeyas well.The past and what has been lost is very much in the albumrsquos DNA. The opening track Still Snowing in Sapporo takes us back to a moment in time before Edwards disappeared, when the band were still young. \"Im walking on my own, its  ...\" the first line goes.ldquoIt just gives me goosebumps, Wire says of the track. ldquoItrsquos such a vivid recollection of that particular time. I can remember that more than what I did yesterday.ldquoI donrsquot knowyoursquore the same. Such a bizarre thing. I can remember me and Richeydoing hairspray and doing eyeliner. I donrsquot even knowIrsquove had a shower yet today.In  the Manics are a long way from the young firebrands who burst out of Blackwood, all gobbiness, make-up and utter certainty in their own brilliance.ldquoI really miss that certainty of youth, Wire admits. ldquoThe power, the energy. I wish I could be like that again, but I think itrsquos a real hood to pretend you are like thatyoursquore not.ldquoItrsquos much more about navigating the complexities now in all forms of le whilst trying to live the fantasy of being in a rock and roll band on top of that.ldquoLook, wersquore not going to be like the Ramones just bashing it out, lsquoone, two, three, four.rsquo I do admire bands that grow and develop and have dferent phases and dferent eras.There is still the odd flash of anger and fire in the Manics, though. Therersquos a couplet on the new album very much designed for the moment we are living through. ldquoDonrsquot let those boys from Eton suggest that we are beaten, James Dean Bradfield snarls at one point on Donrsquot Let the Night Divide Us.Are you hopeful or despairing right now, Nicky ldquoWorking class culture when we were growing up, to me at any rate, seemed much more powerful. Everywhere you looked there was someone you admired, and they came from the same kind of background as yourself, shared similar viewpoints. And that seems to have disappeared. And I donrsquot blame anyone for it. Itrsquos just the culture.ldquoI always give young kids a pass because I was an idiot when I was young and I feel they donrsquot have half the benefits that I had growing up, all the certainties.Manic Street Preachers. photograph Alex LakeThe Ultra Vivid Lament, it should be said, is as much about the personal as it is about the world around us.ldquoI like internal galaxies as well, and this album is very much about still trying to discover yourself in your fties. What makes you tick and where your beliefs lie. I think self-examination is really good for the soul. I think itrsquos much better to do that to yourself than through a mobile device. I think thatrsquos where things can get really twisted. I prefer the mirror to the screen.There can be surely few bands more aware of the weight of their own history than the Manics. Is that ever a burden ldquoIt is dficult, Wire agrees. ldquoThe more it goes on it does become a weight on your shoulder a bit. He pauses, redirects the thought. ldquoTherersquos loads to celebrate. Irsquom glad wersquove been commercially massive and commercially disastrous. You appreciate it more and itrsquos just much more interesting anyway.ldquoPeople still want to write about us eventhey donrsquot like us. You canrsquot complain about that.When Manic Street Preachers first appeared they were angry, spiteful and often hilarious suffused with the arrogance and flash of youth. You seemed to hate everyone, Nicky.ldquoIrsquom not afraid to say we were hatred-fuelled and nihilistic at the start. A lot of my favourite music growing up was like that.ldquoBut Irsquove learned to control it and try to turn it into hellip I donrsquot know hellip I hate the word thoughtful hellip But to articulate it a bit better than through nihilism.ldquoI wouldnrsquot swap those years at the start for anything, but as a human being yoursquove got to try and develop.

It was not, however, for prowess in battle that he was given these awards, far from it.These honours instead represent a labour of love. The medals are for his prize-winning bee keeping and the rich, golden-coloured honey which sits in large plastic tubs and glass jars stacked in his cellar workspace.Talk to Dumendzic about his bees and his eyes light up as they do when he talks also of the near-magical qualities of honey.Talk to him about his past as a soldier in the defence of his hometown of Vuko and subsequent spell in three Serbian military-run detention camps during which he was brutally tortured, and the narrowing of his eyes reveals the pain he and countless others in Vuko underwent during the -day siege and its aftermath back in in .Many people reading this will doubtless have heard of those other infamous towns and cities under siege and ravaged by bloodletting and massacres during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.Places like Sarajevo, Srebrenica and Mostar. Few, however, will have heard of Vuko, the town of some -, people that as a young journalist  years ago I managed to gain access as the Yugoslav National Armyas it was then, supported by notorious Serb paramilitaries, surrounded this backwater on the banks of the Danube river.Up until that moment, Vuko had been a prosperous Baroque town and mixed community of Croats, Serbs and other ethnic groups. But itrsquos been said of that time the entire region was ldquodrunk on slivovitz and nationalism, a reference to a powerful and intoxicating local fruit brandy and the political, ethnic and nationalist fervour that gripped communities during that period.With isions fanned by Serbiarsquos president Slobodan Milosevic and Croatiarsquos president Franjo Tudjman, an armed insurrection was started by Serb militias in Croatia, supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups that seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia.OnslaughtAS the JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion, clashes and conflict brewed before breaking out wholesale in some areas including Vuko ndash and the onslaught on the town began.In Vukorsquos defence stood some , armed policemen and soldiers of the Croatian National Guardas well as civilian volunteers who were up against , JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries armed with tanks, heavy artillery, aircraft and gunboats operating along the Danube theof Vuko.Little did I know it back then, after myself and a colleague slipped through the lines into besieged Vuko, that it would become the equivalent of a Croatian Stalingrad with the determination of it defenders reaching near-legendary status and subsequently the subject of folklore, poems and songs.At its height, the battle for the town saw some of the fiercest and most protracted fighting since  with up to , shells a day fired by Serb forces exploding into a community whose citizens were forced to lead a near-subterranean existence hunkered down in cellars and basements.As the siege deepened in what remained of the town, the still unfallen walls stood up like reefs beneath the surface of a lagoon, while for weeks on end those trapped in the town lay under a web of arching shells in a suspense of uncertainty.During the townrsquos physical evisceration ndashfor thatrsquos what became of it ndash what the world witnessed was the opening salvoes of the wars that marked the break-up of Yugoslavia and set in motion the mass murder, ethnic cleansing, deportation, mass rape and crimes again humanity that became the grisly trademarks of this terrible series of wars.It has been said that in civil war the firing line is invisible and instead passes through the hearts of those men and women caught up in its bitter throes. As one of those engulfed in the battle, Ivan Dumendzic agreed to meet me and talk at a cafeacute adjacent to the Hotel Dunav about our mutual experiences of those terrible times.Today the hotel sits derelict but it was in the ldquoDunav that I found myself based during the siege alongside those Croatian defenders billeted there and the hotelrsquos remaining staff of cooks, cleaners, waiters and waitresses. As the siege tightened these staff members could not even journey the few miles to their homes such was the ferocity of the shelling, rocket and sniper fire from the attacking Serb forces.Surreal scenesLIKE so much of that time, the scene was often surreal. I recall, for example, sheltering one day in the hotel basement when heavily-armed Croatian soldiers started dancing with waitresses to the song Shiny Happy People by the band REM. The music came from an MTV video on a television set run from a generator as the electricity in the town was by that time intermittent.As the soldiers and waitresses danced, the lyrics of the song struck an ironic tone:Shiny happy people laughingMeet me in the crowd, people, peopleThrow your love around, love me, love meTake it into town, happy, happy hellipEvery so often all of us, dancers included, would wince as the picture crackled and plasterwork fell from the roof with the arrival of another shell. ldquoGet down here, shouted Marian, the hotelrsquos receptionist one afternoon, pulling me into a corridor as narrow as a babyrsquos coffin. There was another shattering explosion and I chased Marian across the lobby, crunching through the glass and broken masonry where the entrance had been blown in seconds before. Waiting for an explosion is the longest passage of time I know.At night we would lie in the hotelrsquos corridors shivering like wet dogs, waiting for the next shell, the floors soaked from blasted water tanks and littered with dead seagulls and pigeons blown into the building from the nearby Danube by the impact of tank and mortar rounds.My own days, like most in Vuko, were spent running the gauntlet of snipers. That moment of fear waiting to make the dash across the street ndash it was always asall my senses rushed to the back of my neck. Like a child going of the high board at the swimming baths for the first time. ldquoWill I, or wonrsquot I  Then suddenly you are out there, committed, exposed.At such times I would often imagine the sniper squinting through the crosshairs. What was going through his mind at the moment he took aim  Bullets travel faster than sounds, so Irsquoll never hear the one that gets me, I reassured myself.Sometimes the surrealism of such instances was almost other-worldly. I recall one young soldier I encountered in the shattered streets. Glassy-eyed, his face daubed with camouflage paint and topped with Rambo-style headscarf, who clearly didnrsquot give a damn any more.ldquoWho killed Laura Palmer  He asked, before flicking his cigarette into the rubble of the street and sprinting towards the next point of cover a few yards away.Without any apparent reason his question was a bizarrely-timed reference to a character in the then-popular US mystery-horror TV series Twin Peaks made by the acclaimed producer director David Lynch.Irsquove never understood what he meant by the question, but have since realised people often say the oddest things at moments of high stress or trauma.lsquoTerrible daysrsquoSITTING last week at the cafeacute opposite the Hotel Dunav, Dumendzic told me of his own experiences during those months of the battle for Vuko. ldquoThose were terrible days, times I will never forget and which I, like so many others, never expected to survive, he told me. As a soldier, Dumendzic was active on Vukorsquos frontlines, also losing members of his own family to the relentless bombardment and watching his friends and comrades suffer.On my laptop I showed him some photographs Irsquod taken of those dark days, flicking from one image to another and askinghe knew anyone depicted in them.It was only when one picture taken outside the Hotel Dunav after a particularly heavy barrage of shelling had subsided and showing a lone young soldier dressed in fatigues, a headband, and carrying a Kalashnikov rle next to a damaged jeep popped up on screen, did Dumendzic let out a sudden cry of recognition: ldquoDamir Kovacic!Kovacic has been one of his best friends and they had gone to high school together and lived in the same neighbourhood Dumendzic, told me. Did Kovacic survive the war I asked ldquoNo, he was wounded and taken to Vuko hospital but then was killed with the others at Ovcara, Dumendzic explained in a new twist to both the menrsquos stories.The mass slaughter at Ovcara farm to which Dumendzic referred followed immediately in the wake of Vukorsquos fall when on the morning of November , organised resistance finally collapsed in the town.At the main hospital crammed with wounded, some  patients and staff, mainly Croats and some others, were taken forcibly taken to the nearby Ovcara pig farm.The age of these prisoners ranged from  to , and at the farm they were beaten and tortured while Serb paramilitary forces prepared a mass grave into which the victims were dumped after being shot dead in batches of  and  over a four-hour period. It was here that Ivan Dumendzicrsquos friend and comrade, Damir Kovacic, met his grisly end, though to this day his remains, like those of  others, have never been found.Experts say the mass grave was so full and shallow that the Serb killers were forced to move the corpses where, but no-one yet knows exactly where the location lies.Wanting to see for myself the place where Damir Kovacic was brutally slain along with  others from Vuko hospital, I went to the Ovcara farm memorial site a few days ago.Ghostly imagesTHERE, amid a bleak windswept field, sits the memorial centre in which there is a darkened warehouse on the walls of which are ghostly projected images of the hundreds of victims.It was in this pitch-black interior that the face of Damir Kovacic looked out at me, just as he had that day  years ago in  when I took his photograph outside the Hotel Dunav during a lull in the shelling.Never could I have imagined that all these years later our paths would cross again, albeitunder very dferent and sad circumstances.ldquoHe was a smart guy at school and both of us were only  years old when we fought to defend Vuko, his friend Dumendzic told me at we sat at the cafeacute outside the Hotel Dunav, joined towards the end of our converasation by Ivanrsquos we, Slavica.They were the among the lucky ones able to escape the aftermath of the siege but not before Ivan went through many months more of hell in three detentions camps where he suffered terrible torture including being beaten by Serb guards wielding clubs and shovels.After a short time where in Croatia, the couple ed to their home in Vuko which was destroyed but which they have now rebuilt along with their threechildren.At their house, which stands a short distance from the giant water tower that dominates the Vuko skyline and which the defenders used as a sniperrsquos nest during the war before it was turned into a museum, they proudly show me their stack of honey from the bee keeping to which Ivan is now so devoted. Outside in the garden, the trees are laden with apples from which they make jam and Ivan tells of their plans to extend an outhouse to make a bigger workshop for his beloved bee keeping.When the siege of Vuko ended, over , people had lost their lives ndash the oldest victim in their s whilethe youngest was just a few months old.The scale of the townrsquos destruction shocked many who had not left their shelters in weeks. It also shocked a world that had looked on and continued to look on as further horrors and war crimes engulfed former Yugoslavia.Returning to Vuko has been an emotional experience for me and I will never forget what I saw there  years ago. That there are still ghosts and its people are haunted by the past, I have no doubt.But towns and cities, like the people who inhabit them, never truly die and rise from the ashes. Ivan Dumendzic and his we Slavica, with their beehives, honey and apple trees, are wonderful testimony to that power of rebirth"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13040179.jpg?type=article-full","title":"september-weekend-ferry-fiasco-calmac-vessel-action","story":"Ferries across the taxpayer-owned CalMac leline vessel network are expected once again to be re-organised with a host of sailings cancelled to try and cover for for -year-old MV Hebrides which has been hit with stabiliser issues.There was further concern amongst ferry users after preparing for the Millport September Weekend after they were notied that MV Loch Riddon which was due toto Largs to support the event had been delayed in an annual overhaul.It was due to be completed on Tuesday, but may not be back in action till today at the earliest.September Weekend organisers had hoped that there would beextra supportfrom Cumbrae Slip.:Three CalMac vessels sidelined in a day mdash including an emergency charter for a second timeBut on Friday there was a two hour waiting time for vehicles at Largs.One ferry user said: \"Its just not good enough\".Hebrides, which can carry  passengers and  cars was due to be replaced by a new ship, one of two dual-fuel vessels at the centre of a ferry-building fiasco that are languishing in Ferguson Marine shipyard in Port Glasgow on the Clyde.After a delay of over four years the new ferry, known as Hull , is expected in early .CalMac have said that it can continue to carry out a severely restricted service on its usual Uig on Skye to Lochmaddy on North Uist and Tarbert routes, while repairs are carried out.But users have been told that its operations will be impaired during \"adverse weather\" and as that is expected on Saturday, so theservice has been cancelled.The Scottish Government-controlled ferry operator said they are in the process of contacting all customers affected by the disruption.\"We are working on a repair plan to have this issue rectied as soon as possible and are currently working on contingency plans,\" CalMac said.Hebrides had only been back in service for hours after being sidelined due to positive Covid case.Hebrides was out of action at the end of August afteran oil leak was discovered on the shaft seals.It went into dry dock in Birkenhead and was due to be out of service until September .Customers began asking about what was happening with services on Friday evening.Susan Macleod said: \"Wewere booked on Uig to Tarbert ferry tomorrow morning and its cancelled.

Her party lost several seats, but kept eight, outscoring poll predictions.The three ruling parties have not announced whether they will work together for another term, but given the strong support from voters it appears likely.It will take days,not weeks, for a new government to be formed and announced. vw,vw,px, px\"People leave a polling station in Reykjavik Climate change had ranked high on the election agenda in Iceland, a glacier-studded volcanic island nation of about , people in the North Atlantic.An exceptionally warm summer by Icelandic standards mdash with  days of temperatures above Cmdash and shrinking glaciers have helped drive global warming up the political agenda.But that did not appear to have translated into increased support for any of the four left-leaning parties that campaigned to cut carbon emissions by more than Iceland is committed to under the Paris Climate Agreement.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

None of this is down to me, it is down to working as a team.“In that I include the board which over the years has been absolutely fantastic in supporting ideas.#If the board didn#t think that taking on a handy person project or setting up care and repair, or energy advice service was good, these things wouldn#t have happened — they have been very open about the role that the association could play as a community anchor.”He added: #Some of the things that we do I think are fantastic and have been copied where in Scotland # because the notion that we would have handyperson employees installing telecom devices in people#s homes throughout the whole of the Highlands just wouldn#t have been thought of.#I have been really lucky with the quality and flexibility of the people I have worked with # both the board and the staff members.#Commenting on his successor, he went on to say: #Neil Clapperton was until recently the chief executive of Grampian Housing Association through in Aberdeen # so it is a relief to be able to hand over to an experienced person rather than someone from another discipline to be trained up by the existing staff and board.#I think with the senior management now led by Neil and with keeping the same people such as Iain McIvor as director of investment, and our new director of finance services, Graeme Coull, and of course Angus MacLennan as our technical manager — that#s a really powerful team to take the organisation forward.#I#ll miss the people, they are absolutely splendid.#Reflecting on his time, Lachie said: #The housing system in the Highlands and Islands has never been in a better position.“My ambition was to wipe out homelessness in Skye and Lochalsh before I retired, and while I have not quite achieved that we have made huge strides towards dealing with that dficult issue.#I am quite optimistic that I am leaving the sector in a good position and ready to meet the challenges that they have ahead.#Looking ahead to retired le, Lachie said:#My three children and my grandchildren are all resident in and around Glasgow, they are all busy people but I want to spend signicantly more time with them, and also my family from Uist # I have sisters and lots of relatives over there so I#ll have a lot more time to visit them.“And I want to carry on my work as a board member with Am Fasgadh .#The only bit of advice I#ve had about retirement that someone said to me was #When you retire do nothing, and then do something’.

However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings.

She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

Furthermore, the estimated number of movies that began shooting declined by % to .The downturn had a knock-on effect on global revenue, which fell by % in  compared to the previous year.Yet, at such precarious times for the industry, the Ballymena actor is still pumping out big box office draws and topping Netflix’s movie charts.Over the past  months, the -year-old Taken star, who has rebranded himself as a not-to-be-messed-with action figure in his middle age, opened two films at number one.The Marksman, in which he plays an Arizona rancher who becomes the unlikely defender of a Mexican boy pursued by cartel assassins, knocked Wonder Woman  from the top spot on its release earlier this year. Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      A few months earlier, Honest Thief held the top spot at the box office for two weeks back-to-back, grossing .m from , cinemas on its first day. While revenue was down due to the pandemic, the film’s performance proved cinemagoers hadn’t given up on big screens.Not content with being the only actor to lend his name to two number-one box office hits since the pandemic kicked off, Neeson’s thriller The Ice Road was the most-watched movie on Netflix  hours after premiering at the start of the summer. An older movie, Unknown, originally released a decade ago, drew strong viewing figures on Netflix back in January this year, again ranking at number one.It doesn’t stop there. February sees the US release of another Neeson-fronted thriller, Blacklight, directed by Mark Williams. It sees him play a fixer for the FBI who is tasked with pulling undercover agents out of dangerous situations. He finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy when one such agent questions the people he is working for.The father-of-two is currently filming Retribution, a Speed-like thriller about a bank executive whose le is thrown upside down when a bomb is placed inside his car with him and his family. A few other thriller-type films are in the pipeline, currently at the pre-production stage.So what drives Neeson to be so prolic and why does his appeal endure  Film critic and lecturer Mike Catto said there were a number of reasons why directors and film fans alike are so Taken with the Northern Irish man.“From people who have worked with him, I’ve been told he is extremely hard-working, just gets on with it and there are never any tantrums He has a strong work ethic and still feels the impetus to work. If the work is there, he will take it,” he added.“Neeson is still in good health and shape, andwe look at Hollywood’s history, actors like James Stewart and Henry Fonda were still working into their s.“There are two strong reasons why his appeal is so enduring: firstly, his reliability. His movie A Walk Among the Tombstones wasn’t his greatest but still attracted an audience.“Secondly, his voice. It’s easily recognisable, in the same way Sean Connery had a distinctive voice. Put Neeson’s name above the title and people will come because they like that voice.”Catto said changes in the technology behind movie-making also meant that high-quality feature films could be made faster, using high-definition video and electronic editing. He said the advent of streaming services had prompted a demand for middle budget films that didn’t require massive sets or fancy special effects, and that many of Neeson’s movies fell into this category.“There are other actors who have many projects on the go at the one time, like Matt Damon or Kenneth Branagh,” added Catto.“Neeson certainly has a good few years left in him yet. I can’t see him leaping off roofs in  years, but as the movie Ordinary Love with Lesley Manville proved, he can be versatile.“If he feels physically and mentally capable of doing the roles, I think he’ll just keep doing them for as long as he can.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsLiam NeesonMost ReadBangor gran loses £, after getting knocked out by rack of floor mats in Poundstretcher shopSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devotees‘Beast of Bangor’ paedophile Gary McNeill dies suddenly after jail releaseMajor drug dealer flees Lisburn home to avoid armed criminals from Dublin collecting £k Kinahan debtPictured: UVF hitman facing trial for murders of two Catholic builders shot dead in Top VideosPlayVideo: Police investigate after car it toppled over in Holyland area of BelfastPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayBalmoral Show: Highlights from across the weekLatest Northern IrelandNearly £, raised for cancer research as Belfast holds first Race for Le in two yearsVideo circulating of car pushed onto side in Belfast’s Holyland, damaging two vehiclesPatience urged ahead of opening of High Street voucher schemeTribute paid to murdered PSNI officer Ronan Kerr during Omagh Pride eventHargey calls for urgent Executive meeting to bypass DUP ‘block’ on welfare lawsLatest‘We are not guaranteed tomorrow,’ priest tells mourners at funeral of Joe McCarron, who was encouraged to leave hospital by Covid scepticsRyder Cup final day: Updates as Rory McIlroy faces Xander Schauffele with Europe trailing USA -Many top players ‘absolutely terried’ by dementia threat posed by headingExit polls suggest German election rivals neck-and-neckDerry Girls filming kicks off Monday … with key cast member missing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

An emphatic yes,” said Secretary Clinton.“I’ve always enjoyed being on university campus, talking with students and faculties, learning about their experiences and perspectives, but Queen’s is special, a university with global reach and local impact. A first class research institution, a centre for innovation and entrepreneurship in technology, business and health, an incubator for artists and activists. I’m looking forward to learning much more about this university’s exciting story and about the future you will create together.“But there was another reason why I agreed to become a member of this community,” she continued.

Bill and I were here to do what we could to support the search for peace, and to light the Christmas tree at City Hall.“It was also the first time I visited Queen’s for a reception right here in Whitla Hall. Representatives of the ious factions were here too. As I remember, the Catholic leadership stood by the band, Protestants stood by the food. It is fitting that today we are all together honouring a group of women who reached across those long-held isions to help make peace real, the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition.Women like Bronagh Hinds, Professor Monica McWilliams, Jane Morrice, Pearl Sagar OBE. They formed their own political party in  in order to participate in the formal peace negotiations. Women did not have a seat at the table. A quarter century of bloodshed and stre and embedded sexism had discouraged most women from politics, but they were relentless in their commitment to peace. They had a great slogan too, ‘Wave Goodbye to the Dinosaurs’.“Throughout my career as First Lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, some of my most cherished memories are moments spent with the remarkable women of Northern Ireland, all waving away those dinosaurs.“Women like the late Pat Hume, a gracious, determined force behind the peace deal.“Women wanted the same things,” said Secretary Clinton.“Good jobs, good schools for their children, streets you could walk down safely, a future you could believe in.“But even here in Northern Ireland, the peace and progress so many worked tirelessly to achieve is incomplete.“The work of integration in housing and schools is far from finished.“Neighbourhoods remain ided. Poverty and unemployment persist. The dficulties of the past continue to threaten the present.“Divisions over Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol and proposed amnesty legislation might very well undermine a peaceful future.“A future that people voted for, fought for, and even died for.”Mrs Clinton said it remains for the people of Northern Ireland to shape the future.“I don’t pretend to have the political answers to resolve this impasse. That is up to the people of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But I do know this, the future of Northern Ireland will be determined by the power of communities coming together, like the one here at Queen’s.“Many of the students here today were born after the Good Friday Agreement was signed. They study together, play sports and join clubs together. They have long, deep conversations late into the night. These may be simple interactions but when considered in the context of Northern Ireland’s history, the idea of young Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalists, loyalists and republicans being one another’s friends, classmates and mentors shows it’s clear these relationships are transformative.”Mrs Clinton said the Good Friday Agreement remains a testament to the courage and faith of the people of Northern Ireland.“But we cannot take it for granted,” she warned.“Seamus Heaney said that sometimes people leave aside their cynicism, their bitterness, their hatreds, and hope and history rhyme. That is the choice the people of Northern Ireland made in .“I sincerely hope it is the choice you and countless others around the world will continue to make.“Peace is a process, not an event. Seamus Heaney also told us to believe a further shore us reachable from here.“The work here at Queen’s is far from finished but we can see that further shore,” she said.“Let us reach towards it together and prove to the world once again that we still live in a time when hope and history rhyme.”Mrs Clinton was appointed to the role for a five-year term in early  but her official installation was delayed due to the Covid- pandemic.As Mrs Clinton took part in the installation procession, a number of anti-war protesters, who had gathered outside, hurled insults and abuse.The ceremony also saw honorary degrees awarded to  leading figures in the worlds of business, politics, sport, the arts, policing and education in Northern Ireland.Among recipients were Derry Girls writer and creator Lisa McGee, former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Sir George Hamilton and Ireland’s highest-capped female athlete, international hockey player Shirley McCay..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s University PremiumDr Gail McConnell pens poetry book about coming to terms with father’s Troubles death PremiumRelentless cyber attacks on NI Civil Service uncoveredPopular writer Stewart Love who penned one of the first Troubles-related plays dies at Coronavirus NI: Students getting vaccinated will help ease disruption to their lives, says health minister as ‘jabbathon’ continuesTrial from Queen’s University leads to improved and money-saving way to treat eye diseaseMost ReadBangor gran loses £, after getting knocked out by rack of floor mats in Poundstretcher shopSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devotees‘Beast of Bangor’ paedophile Gary McNeill dies suddenly after jail releaseMajor drug dealer flees Lisburn home to avoid armed criminals from Dublin collecting £k Kinahan debtPictured: UVF hitman facing trial for murders of two Catholic builders shot dead in Top VideosPlayVideo: Police investigate after car it toppled over in Holyland area of BelfastPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayBalmoral Show: Highlights from across the weekLatest Northern IrelandNearly £, raised for cancer research as Belfast holds first Race for Le in two yearsVideo circulating of car pushed onto side in Belfast’s Holyland, damaging two vehiclesPatience urged ahead of opening of High Street voucher schemeTribute paid to murdered PSNI officer Ronan Kerr during Omagh Pride eventHargey calls for urgent Executive meeting to bypass DUP ‘block’ on welfare lawsLatest‘We are not guaranteed tomorrow,’ priest tells mourners at funeral of Joe McCarron, who was encouraged to leave hospital by Covid scepticsRyder Cup final day: Updates as Rory McIlroy faces Xander Schauffele with Europe trailing USA -Many top players ‘absolutely terried’ by dementia threat posed by headingExit polls suggest German election rivals neck-and-neckDerry Girls filming kicks off Monday … with key cast member missing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeA MediahuisWebsitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"jim allister dup and uup should refuse to nominate deputy first minister if sinn fein become largest party","story":"TUV leader Jim Allister.

Sopeople want to guarantee there will never be a Sinn Fein First Minister then they should vote for the TUV.“Will the other two unionist parties give that guarantee  Let’s hear from them. They need to be clear to the electorate.”In the event of such a scenario, Stormont’s rules mean the UK Secretary of State would either have to call another snap election or London would proceed with direct rule from Westminster and the civil service.Read MoreUUP leader Beattie rejects Donaldson’s calls for unionist pact to stop Sinn FeinMr Allister said the prospect of direct rule was “preferable” to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Boris Johnson is a man I wouldn’t trust but unionism’s strength lies in the fact there is still a majority in the province in favour of the maintenance of the Union, no matter how duplicitous a prime minister might be,” he added.“We’ve only ever had a distorted form of devolution, with no opposition to a mandatory coalition. If the only form of devolution we are allowed is one that is subject to having Sinn Fein at the top and at its heart, then to me it’s not a form of devolution worth having.“Direct rule under those circumstances is therefore preferable.”The DUP and UUP have been contacted for a response.Meanwhile, Mr Allister said the refusal of President Michael D Higgins to attend a centenary event in Armagh next month proves to unionists that the Irish state hasn’t given up their territorial claim to Northern Ireland.The president said that the religious event involving The Queen had become political and that his sole reason for not attending was “in relation to the title” of the event.In response, Mr Allister told the newspaper: “I suppose it is a case of ‘I told you so’. It is a wake-up call for those unionists who believed the Republic gave up their constitutional claim.“When [he] says, ‘I am the president of Ireland,’ where’s the evidence that they have really given up in spirit the territorial claim  When he says he won’t come to Armagh to even mark the establishment of Northern Ireland, then where is the real change “The president’s hissy fit tells unionists that, whatever they said about giving up the constitutional claim in the Belfast agreement, they didn’t really mean it.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBangor gran loses £, after getting knocked out by rack of floor mats in Poundstretcher shopSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devotees‘Beast of Bangor’ paedophile Gary McNeill dies suddenly after jail releaseMajor drug dealer flees Lisburn home to avoid armed criminals from Dublin collecting £k Kinahan debtPictured: UVF hitman facing trial for murders of two Catholic builders shot dead in Top VideosPlayVideo: Police investigate after car it toppled over in Holyland area of BelfastPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayBalmoral Show: Highlights from across the weekLatest PoliticsDUP leader Donaldson calls for electoral pact among unionist parties to stop Sinn FeinMy le fell apart so fast... it can happen to anyoneVaz did enormous harm to me and my career, reveals NI victim of bullying MPStormont Executive says no changes to coronavirus restrictions until October Hospitality Ulster claims no consultation on SDLP vaccine passport plan, as Eastwood says he spoke to we and othersLatestMerkel’s bloc eyes worst result since  but hopes to lead coalition stillEmile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka star as Arsenal beat rivals TottenhamMany top players ‘absolutely terried’ of dementia threat posed by heading‘We are not guaranteed tomorrow,’ priest tells mourners at funeral of Joe McCarron, who was encouraged to leave hospital by Covid scepticsRyder Cup final day: Updates as Rory McIlroy faces Xander Schauffele with Europe trailing USA -,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Philip McKinney, an Alliance councillor on Derry City and Strabane District Council, said government intervention was needed quicklywe are not to have permanent empty shelves. He said: We need action, not just words. Im an Alliance councillor, but Im saying this as a truck driver of  years experience. googletag.cmd.push “I dont have all the answers. We need government intervention - and quickly -we are not to have empty shelves permanently.” He said there were four main reasons for a shortage of drivers. “Brexit: a lot of our drivers from countries like Romania went back to the EU. “Training - If youre , you can apply for a LGV+C provisional licence. But to get a full LGV C+E licence, can cost between pound, and pound,. What young person has that sort of money available  But many training companies try to help with payment plans.  “There are very few government incentives for young people. But there are ways to bring people into the industry without fees.  Truck driver, Alliiance Councillor Philip McKinney.  “At the English depot of one Northern Ireland hauler, an apprenticeship scheme was introduced - run in conjunction with a training company with government grants. And successful apprentices walked straight into full-time jobs. “As well as being responsible for a pound, truck and high value cargo, a driver needs to know the traffic laws of the country theyre driving in, EU driver hour regulations, road transport regulations, hazardous goods legislation and licences, working time directive health and safety regulations and the driver Certicate of Professional Competence.” Cllr McKinney said wages were obviously important. He added: “The average is around pound per hour, unless you have specialist freight.     The hauliers arent totally to blame for this because in the past the client dictated the haulage rate and to a small haulier every penny counted. It was sink or swim. If we want to keep goods moving, haulage and drivers rates are going to rise  - unfortunately for the consumer.” Describing infrastructure in this part of the world as abysmal, Councillor McKinney added: “Its an embarrassment that we still dont have a motorway dual carriageway between Belfast and the North West. “For example,  I have to take a load from Birmingham to Gweedore Industrial Estate in Donegal, I join the M motorway to Scotland. I take my breaks in motorway services with proper facilities. I get the ferry from Cairnryan to Belfast and continue to Gweedore. “I have to have a full daily rest of minimum nine hours. So, where are the facilities between Belfast and Gweedore   It’s scandalous that drivers must put up with the lack of facilities in Northern Ireland.  “Where are the proper facilities where a driver can sit down, eat a meal in comfort, with proper shower and toilets, and park my truck in a secure area.” “And facilities are even worse for female drivers.” Concluding, Counillor McKinney said: “Actions, please - not just words.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Philip McKinney, an Alliance councillor on Derry City and Strabane District Council, said government intervention was needed quicklywe are not to have permanent empty shelves. He said: We need action, not just words. Im an Alliance councillor, but Im saying this as a truck driver of  years experience. googletag.cmd.push “I dont have all the answers. We need government intervention - and quickly -we are not to have empty shelves permanently.” He said there were four main reasons for a shortage of drivers. “Brexit: a lot of our drivers from countries like Romania went back to the EU. “Training - If youre , you can apply for a LGV+C provisional licence. But to get a full LGV C+E licence, can cost between pound, and pound,. What young person has that sort of money available  But many training companies try to help with payment plans.  “There are very few government incentives for young people. But there are ways to bring people into the industry without fees.  Truck driver, Alliiance Councillor Philip McKinney.  “At the English depot of one Northern Ireland hauler, an apprenticeship scheme was introduced - run in conjunction with a training company with government grants. And successful apprentices walked straight into full-time jobs. “As well as being responsible for a pound, truck and high value cargo, a driver needs to know the traffic laws of the country theyre driving in, EU driver hour regulations, road transport regulations, hazardous goods legislation and licences, working time directive health and safety regulations and the driver Certicate of Professional Competence.” Cllr McKinney said wages were obviously important. He added: “The average is around pound per hour, unless you have specialist freight.     The hauliers arent totally to blame for this because in the past the client dictated the haulage rate and to a small haulier every penny counted. It was sink or swim. If we want to keep goods moving, haulage and drivers rates are going to rise  - unfortunately for the consumer.” Describing infrastructure in this part of the world as abysmal, Councillor McKinney added: “Its an embarrassment that we still dont have a motorway dual carriageway between Belfast and the North West. “For example,  I have to take a load from Birmingham to Gweedore Industrial Estate in Donegal, I join the M motorway to Scotland. I take my breaks in motorway services with proper facilities. I get the ferry from Cairnryan to Belfast and continue to Gweedore. “I have to have a full daily rest of minimum nine hours. So, where are the facilities between Belfast and Gweedore   It’s scandalous that drivers must put up with the lack of facilities in Northern Ireland.  “Where are the proper facilities where a driver can sit down, eat a meal in comfort, with proper shower and toilets, and park my truck in a secure area.” “And facilities are even worse for female drivers.” Concluding, Counillor McKinney said: “Actions, please - not just words.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Shaping Ourselves and Our Children’ , the cross-border parenting programme celebrated the success of their project by presenting evidence on project outcomes at their SOOC ‘Social and Cultural Diversity and Family Le Conference’ held in the City Hotel. googletag.cmd.push The programme which is supported by the European Union’s PEACE IV programme and managed by the Special EU Programmes Bodywas developed by the Lestart Foundation and its partners: Lestart Services CLG, Lestart Supporting Parents Leitrim Sligo and West Cavan CLG, the Dunluce Family Centre, Barnardos NI , and The Junction. Match-funding for the project has been provided by the Executive Office, Northern Ireland and the Dept. of Rural and Community Development, Ireland. Guest speakers at the conference included Junior Stormont Ministers DUP Foyle MLA Gary Middleton and Sinn Fein MLA Declan Kearney, Dr Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, Ireland, Professor Siobhan O’Neill, Mental Health Sciences Ulster University, Northern Ireland and Gina McIntyre, chief executive of the Special EU Programmes Body. The event was chaired by Dr Pauline Mc Clenaghan, executive director Lestart Foundation Ltd . SOOC is an inter- generational programme aimed at promoting recon- ciliation and good relations by addressing the site where identity, values and social attitudes are initially formed and shaped. i.e. in the home, where the parent is the key actor and where caregiver  child relationships and interactions are foundational to child development and learning.     Mr Middleton said: “I want to congratulate The Lestart Foundation and all the partners who helped deliver the Shaping Ourselves and Our Children project as part of the PEACE IV programme. “The Lestart Foundation has  years’ experience in delivering quality parenting education and family support. The combined knowledge and expertise of the delivery partners has enabled this important project to be delivered successfully. Mr Middleton concluded: “I welcome the evaluation report which will create a legacy for the programme and ensure that the learning from the project can be shared throughout our society.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The decision comes following allegations of the former Derry  Strabane councillor of spreading misinformation regarding the Covid- pandemic. Although she had retired from practicing medicine back in , she ed to work to help NHS staff during the Covid crisis. googletag.cmd.push However, during that time, she had posted online about her scepticism of lockdowns and how serious the virus was to peoples lives. One post likened the vaccines administration to that of work done by the Nazis who experimented on humans in concentration camps. Dr McCloskey also featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been “coerced, bribed or bullied” into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were “malevolent”. The GMC said: “The tribunal directed an -month interim suspension but all such restrictions are kept under regular review while a full investigation is carried out. “Doctors are unable to practice medicine in the UK while interim suspended. “These tribunals do not determine the facts of what happened, but undertake a risk assessment of whether temporary protection is needed.” The GMC investigated former Aontuacute councillor Dr McCloskey following a complaint made by Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin of the SDLP. She said: “I requested the General Medical Council to consider two social media videos posted by a Derry GP. It is essential that medical professionals provide patients and the general public with the best possible advice with regard to vaccinations. There is overwhelming evidence that vaccinations provide protection against the worst effects of Covid.     “I am extremely concerned that anti-vaccination and Covid denying propaganda is discouraging some of our population from being vaccinated. That is extremely damaging to the health of our population. “Derry continues to have a very high rate of Covid infection and the North of Ireland as a whole continues to suffer from a comparatively low vaccination rate. The medical profession obviously has a key role in tackling these issues.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The families have rallied together in a stand against the UK Government’s intended amnesty for all those who committed conflict-related offences. googletag.cmd.push Emmett McConomy, brother of ten-year-old Stephen, killed by a plastic bullet fired by a British soldier, spoke to the crowd: “Nearly  years later, we have the British Government, namely Boris Johnson and Brandon Lewis, telling us and all the other victims of this conflict that he’s doing us a favour. “He’s drawn a line under the past for us. This he says will help the healing process and move us further along the road to reconciliation. “Well, I have a clear message for you, Mr Lewis and Mr Johnson, how dare you try and speak for me and try and tell me what is best for our family. Do not speak for me and my brother. Do not speak for Stephen and you surely do not speak for the people of Derry.” The proposed government amnesty would prevent prosecutions for conflict-related offences and close down present and future police and Police Ombudsman investigations, civil actions and legacy inquests. Other rallies were organised in protest of the amnesty today both North and South of the border. See Mondays paper for full coverage.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Banking -Choosing a student bank account can be tricky, especially as banks try to lure you in with exciting free perks.

Providers -When deciding who to go with for things like broadband don’t just go for the cheapest option.

Counties are currently instructed to provide team sheets to the relevant organising body for match programme purposes no later than am on the Thursday before a weekend fixture. However, several counties communicate their line-ups with the proviso that they are not to be issued to the public until they themselves publish them. When they do, a number don’t include their  substitutes. googletag.cmd.push The GAA are to release the team and substitute lists more than  hours before the first matches as a means of promoting the games as well as cutting out the possibility of leaks. It is envisaged the move might prompt counties to announce their line-ups before Friday. The Thursday morning registration, which prevents counties from making th-hour changes to their squad unless in an emergency, was voted in at Congress in Paacuteraic Duffy’s time as director-general as a way of combatting dummy teams. Penalties for not providing the -man list included the withdrawal of sideline privileges for the manager for one match and a fine of up to €, for the county board. Forfeiture is the punishment for fielding a player who has not been registered on the list provided to the referee. The lack of consideration in the rules for late injuries and sickness has been regularly condemned by managers and there have been some instances where less than  players have been available as the deadline for personnel changes had passed and injured men have togged out with no intention of being used.     Match regulations state for non senior inter-county championship games the teams are to be issued to the committee in charge for the official programme and media four days before the game although it is rarely respected, while for league games, the home county must receive team selection from the visitors no later than Wednesday prior to the fixture. For Saturday games, several of the leading counties in both codes make their team disclosures the night previous.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The .

Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Mega Draw excitement is building ahead of Friday night’s extra special EuroMillions promotional event which has a guaranteed jackpot of € million. Since the EuroMillions game launched in Ireland in , there have been  Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners. If tomorrow night’s staggering € million jackpot is won in Ireland, we could see a new Irish winner added to the roll call of jackpot wins. googletag.cmd.push The National Lottery has advised players dreaming of winning big in the th September draw to continue to follow public health guidelines andplaying in retail, to buy their tickets early to avoid queues which will inevitably build in the hours leading up to the cut-off for ticket sales at .pm on Friday evening. Meanwhile, the Lotto jackpot roll continues and is now set to hit an estimated € million. The current Lotto jackpot has been rolling for over three months since Wednesday th June. So far this year, there have been five Lotto jackpot wins by players in Limerick, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Cork and Galway. In the history of the Lotto game in Ireland, only one jackpot in excess of € million has ever been won which was in June  when the Dan Morrissey syndicate from Carlow scooped a whooping €,,. A single winner of Saturday night’s le-changing € millionjackpot would find themselves at number two on the list of all-time highest wins since the game launched in Ireland in .     A National Lottery spokesperson said:“What a weekend we have ahead of us! We could potentially see two hugely le-altering amounts being won by National Lottery players in Ireland. Tomorrow night’s Mega Draw EuroMillions event with a guaranteed € million jackpot is creating incredible excitement amongst our players. If a player in Ireland scoops this astonishing amount, it would bring to , the number of Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners since the game launched in Ireland in . And of course, there is a huge buzz around this weekend’s Lotto draw with the jackpot heading towards an estimated € million, the spokersperon said. The current Lotto jackpot has been on an unprecedented roll without a winner since June and is now edging very close to reaching the current jackpot cap. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June . Once the jackpot exceeds the cap, no more money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. If the jackpot is won at an amount higher than €. million, that amount will become the game’s new jackpot cap. “With two incredible jackpots in both EuroMillions and Lotto just a day apart, we are encouraging players to purchase their tickets early as we expect there to be a big uptake in sales ahead of the draw times. We are reminding players that the cut-off time for sales for EuroMillions tickets is at .pm on Friday evening while the cut-off time for sales for Lotto tickets is at .pm on Saturday evening. Tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or atwww.lottery.ie, the spokesperson said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final. He was just a lovely big fella who loved his football and he was just a nice fella to be around.” Funeral arrangements Kevin’s funeral will take place from his home,  Templegrove, tomorrowat .am to Holy Family Church, Ballymagroarty for Requiem Mass at .am.

In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.

Immediately alarm bells would be ringing butyou choose to look beyond the art rock band bit you really are in for a treat. They were assembled in Derry in  by Adam Leonard, who is from Manchester, Chris McConaghy, who is from Our Krypton Son, Gavin McCartney and his brother, Rio, from most of the bands you’ve ever seen, and they play post-punk songs. See post punk would’ve done Adam, Art-Rock  googletag.cmd.push They released their debut album in  and their new one Peter Gabriel is out this week. Oh, and Gavin and Rio are now James Cunningham and Tom Doherty. James is a kopite so we won’t be talking to him, but I did ask Tomwhat he thought ofInvaderband’s first album  “Excellent that was why I decided to join up.” Do you think youll ever be able to play in a band with a bass player that enjoys football  “It’s good to have a bit of banter with him especially when we beat ‘Pool at Anfield.” What was it like making a record during lockdown  “Strange more so with not being in studio for  years.” Apart from the Nerve Centre online gig, how much do you want to get out and play live  “Can’t wait for album launch on  October first live gig with Jamsie in band”. They’re playing Bennigans on October th and you should head down.     I suppose the most important question and the one on everybody’s lips isare you a better drummer than others because you support Everton  “Obviously.” I recently asked Adam he feltInvaderband have improved since bringing an Everton fan in to play drums  “I do, yes. Tom is a brilliant drummer and he’s really enjoying it which has kind of reinvigorated the rest of us. Re: Everton. I asked him about this, and he said something about toffees. I’ve no idea. Football is for morons.” About his writing songs for a while,do you have a pile from the s you can just use, or do you still write away  “Yeah, I don’t need to write anymore because I have such an archive of ones from the s. That’s why they’re so good.“ The Beatles were recording I Want You ’ the day I was born, so it’s in my Northern English blood.” It’s almost like he’s lording it over us that the English colonised Ireland back when Adam was young, but while we’re on the subjecthow awful were the Beatles  “Only a moron would ask that question.” I know what you’re thinking, does Adam know what the word moron means  Probably not but as we’respeaking of terrible,you really like the Darkness  “The word you’re looking for is love. The Darkness are easily the most exciting band on Earth. No-one  comes close”. At this point I expect loads of people to have fired the paper in the bin, but I can’t stress strongly enough that this is not what we should judge Adam on.” We once enjoyed a fizzy pop at the Northern Ireland Music Prize in  when both Invaderband and Our Krypton Son were up for album of the year. It’s become a total nonsense but Invaderbands single I Wont Remember You is up for Best Single at this year’s NI Music Prize!  Invaderband drummer Tom Doherty  And they’re thankful for the recognition and have posted “please” vote for us here:shorturl.at ajzDLMany thanks!#nimpon their socials, which isn’t as cringeworthy as saying nothing and giving the impression that you’re entitled to it. Adam claims to be a Pavement fan and put me to the test and asked what my favourite song is…Stereo, for those that are interested… anyway he ridiculed me for not picking a more obscure one. At least I think that’s what he was doing but coming from a Beatles fan the point was lost, after all this is a man who once said Joy Division were hopeless. New Order even worse. I know, I know, but seriously, give Invaderband a chance, they’re very very good, check them out atinvaderbandand Facebook.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the

now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI.

Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

Please try again later.Submitting...There was nothing like that when I was a child. It was enjoyable enough to clamber up the vast, then state-of-the-art, combine harvesters that they had on display.It was good to see Balmoral having expanded in such ways.It was grey and at points drizzly at Balmoral yesterday yet the atmosphere was happy — perhaps due to the yearning of people to be able to get back to such gatherings. I was struck by Balmoral’s Covid requirements: either proof of full vaccination, or proof of a recent negative NHS Lateral Flow test, or proof of antibodies from PCR test.These seemed to be to be responsible requirements for an event of many people in close proximity. Indeed they seemed to me to be a minimum, because proof of a negative Lateral Flow test on its own is not a strict requirement, due to the possibility of ‘ negatives’ .I agree with Colum Eastwood, SDLP leader, on vaccine passports.A curious feature of Covid is the bitterly ided way in which many people approach the topic.Hardcore anti lockdown believers morph into anti vaxxers.Zero Coviders want severe shutdowns and dismiss any attempt to assess the overall cost of that tactic.And both sides seem to be, at best, selective in use of statistics.For example, I have been since the beginning a mild lockdown sceptic. This was not because lockdown doesn’t work — it obviously doesyou deprive people of all human contact. My concern was whether coronavirus was worth such drastic measures. This is still not clear, because we still do not know the exact societal cost in loneliness, mental illness, impact on non Covid NHS treatments, impact on economies, ruined livelihoods, impaired education and so on.In particular the enduring inequality of it all. The way the public sector is untouched and politicians won’t even countenance, say, a % pay cut to non frontline public sector workers to help fund the devastated self employed.Or the inequality of much of the population living through confinement in houses with ample outdoor space, and others stuck in flats with no garden. These are among reasons we must avoid third lockdown. Yet hardcore lockdown supporters rarely seem to acknowledge these problems. They dismissed the importance of statistics that showed the massive age gradient to Covid, in particular the almost non existent risk to the under s. Yes, the Delta iant has somewhat changed that, and there is a worry with long Covid, but even so it is overwhelmingly fatal only for people who are already gravely ill or nearing end of le.But those of us who accept that reality should be embracing vaccine requirements, and yet many lockdown sceptics are anti such an approach, talking of freedom of choice rather than compulsion. But they should embrace compulsion, in order to ensure freedom of action and freedom of movement!The value of the vaccines is clear in Northern Ireland hospitals intensive care stats. Some % of people in ICUs are entirely unvaccinated, while only % of the adult population is without even one jab.Yet these statistics are turned on their head. It is said that % of people in ICU are double jabbed which proves they don’t work. In fact, given that % of adults in NI have had both doses, it shows you vaccinations slash risk of a severe response to Covid . I was slow to get double jabbed because, in my s, I felt at low risk and the vulnerable people I care about had already had both doses before I became eligible. I soon realised that I was not thinking hard enough about my possible role in spreading infections. I have had both jabs since summer, and think it is a fair bargain for society to open up extensively but give preferential access to people who have two doses.I understand the dismay of people who have loved ones in care homes, and who got their double doses so that they could safely visit, and yet are seeing that resident potentially cared for by staff who have not protected themselves against Covid in the way the relative has.This is all the more painful given how people were not able to see visit home residents for so long.It is a tricky issue because there is already a shortage of care staff. Even so, England is right to move to compulsion for such carers in the coming weeks.• Ben Lowry: A sunny autumn day in Co Down banishes some of my equinox gloom• Ben Lowryis News Letter acting

But not long ago there was strong Eurosceptical sentiment south of the borderThe ‘It’ in question being his Holy Grail-like obsession to create a pan-European army.In the middle of last week the French President once more floated the idea of an EU-wide military force of around , personnel. This time around Macron’s recooked proposal was prompted by the sting of betrayal after the Australians reneged on a deal to buy French submarines opting instead to purchase American made subs. This switch by the Aussies was in large part due to Down Under joining a new military alliance in the Pacic alongside the United States and the UK.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIf Macron’s dream of an alternative European army ever does become reality there is one nation within the EU family of nations he definitely cannot rely on: the Republic of Ireland.The corner stone of Irish foreign policyis military neutrality. Ireland never joined Nato although it has a long and commendable record in sending its military around the world on UN peacekeeping duties. None the less the odds of the Irish Defence Forces providing recruits to a new pan EU army in the foreseeable future are remote.Amid all the gushing, uncritical public discourse in the Republic regarding all things EU these days it is worth remembering that not very long ago there was a powerful Eurosceptical sentiment south of the border. Twelve years ago, in the first referendum on the Lisbon Treaty Irish voters rejected the treaty by .% as opposed to .% who backed the drive towards greater EU integration.One of the principal reasons why Ireland initially voted No was over fears about threats to Irish neutrality and concern about conscription into a European army. Although it was debatableLisbon actually entailed any compulsion to join an EU military force the spectre of it was enough to chill a signicant segment of the Irish electorate.The Dublin government at the time sought to allay these fears but also make the Irish vote again in a second referendum, which was in itself a massive anti-democratic con trick. As someone who reported from the frontline of the later protests against EU imposed austerity measures on the Republic after the Celtic Tiger collapsed and the state headed towards national bankruptcy I often wonder what that second vote would have beenit had been held in the middle of the economic shock treatment being applied from Brussels, Frankfurt, Berlin and the IMF.During those days of protests in  and  I followed tens of thousands marching through Dublin demonstrating against the EU and European Central Bank’s austerity-imposed cuts on Irish public services. I can still hear the speeches from public commentators denouncing the bureaucrats in Brussels, Angela Merkel in Berlin and the bankers at the ECB in Frankfurt on s such as one outside the GPO in O’Connell Street. It’s funny to listen to some of these same voices now in the post-Brexit era lavishing their praise and support on the EU while engaging in some old-fashioned Brit-bashing.In Northern Ireland too there are lots of these voices articulating a misty eyed, sentimental longing to be back in the EU. Nationalists meanwhile are using the enticement of EUas an argument someone for a United Ireland wrapped inside a reunited Europe. As someone who didn’t actually vote for Brexit I am still perplexed over the suspension of critical faculties when it comes to what the EU does in practice as opposed to its rhetoric.Having reported  years ago during that Holy Week of negotiations leading to the Belfast Agreement I cannot recall and none of my colleagues from the time can either the letters E and U being mentioned. Aside from peripheral peace building projects and welcome structural funding, the EU was not a major player in the torturous discussions that eventually created the Good Friday Agreement. Their interference post Brexit in Northern Ireland’s politics and in particular the imposition of the Protocolhowever has the potential to unravel that settlement.For its own economic and strategic interests the EU has used Northern Ireland as a means to punish Britain for leaving the union. By doing so it has generated a widespread perception across the unionist community that the EU is now in league with one side in a ided society – Irish nationalism, north and south. Before Brexit the EU at least had a positive reputation for being neutral on the Northern Ireland question.Irish foreign policy neutrality will undoubtedly prevail evenPresident Macron ever gets his way and establishes his EU army. With the imposition of an Irish Sea Border and the refusal, at least so far, of Brussels to compromise on frontier checks including even medicines EU neutrality in Northern Ireland no longer exists. • Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Ruth Dudley Edwards Sep : New NIO minister is a Gay Catholic Tory who will listen to unionist fears• Owen Polley Sep : Dublin would be horriedfaced with an all-Ireland state• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We are saying that he didn’t raise them with us.”Sir Jeffrey said the church leaders’ statement showed that there was “no known diplomatic attempt” to alter anything about the event.He added: “The rejection of this event by the Irish head of state signals to unionists that the presidential office does not respect Northern Ireland as an entity and has little or no interest in a shared future with unionism.“Such a stance demonstrates how far the office under Michael D Higgins has drted from the shared future principles it once espoused. This disrespect for the existence of Northern Ireland indicates that Michael D Higgins’ office is really a united Ireland champion rather than a leader of reconciliation.”The DUP leader continued: “This saga has been a sad reflection on many years of outreach by unionists like me and others.

Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Tandragee-born Sally and Bessbrook man Billy lived at Knockview Drive, Tandragee and were married for  years.The funeral service was on Monday at Tandragee Presbyterian Church where more than  mourners gathered in the church and adjoining church hall to pay a final lasting tribute to Sally. The service was conducted by the minister the Rev Mark McMaw, assisted by the Rev Stephen Kennedy, minister of Buckna Presbyterian church, Broughshane, and nephew of Billy.Danny Kennedy, brother-in-law of Sally, paid a fulsome tribute to a woman, who, he said, was respected and loved in Tandragee and in the wider community.He said: “This tribute was, in large measure, composed by Billy himself and I do want to convey the deep emotions expressed in it. Sally and Billy were married  years and Billy has described her as ‘a highly principled woman’ with very sterling qualities and positive attitude to le.“Sally was the youngest daughter of three to Daniel and Elizabeth Berry, of Scarva Road, Tandragee. Her sisters Jean , Tandragee and Betty , Loughgall and their families featured strongly all through her le, to the very end. “Sally’s father sadly died at the age of  when Sally was just .

Sally, from the Church of Ireland Billy a Presbyterian. It was a mixed marriage! Sally became a Presbyterian and was a communicant in the Tandragee congregation.“For a short time, they lived with Sally’s widowed mother at Scarva Road, before moving to Cornmarket Street where they resided until moving to the newly built development at Knockview Drive in . By then, they had a young daughter, Julie, who was just six months when they moved to Knockview. “The Kennedy’s of Knockview were a close family of three, with Julie very attached to her mum especially. Sally and Julie were soul mates, and the bond became closer when Julie, after her marriage to Colin Beattie, had two daughters Lily and Isla. Sally loved her grand-daughters they were her pride and joy and, in recent times, when they visited the care home to see their nanny after Sally’s stroke, her joyful reaction was obvious. The girls would sing and converse lovingly with their nanny.“Sally was intensely proud of her home it was her castle and she enjoyed making it a special place for her family. She was very supportive of Billy in his career as a journalist with the News Letter, working long hours as news editor in Belfast during years of the Troubles. Sally, as a loyal Tandragee lady also encouraged Billy in his role with the loyal orders in the Bessbrook area.“Even though she had little interest in sport, Sally was also supportive of Billy’s considerable football interests with Linfield Football Club, as a director for  years. But she could read Billy like a book and when Linfield lost, she would quickly ask when he arrived home occasionally looking disconsolate from Windsor Park - ’Well, did the Blues get bate today ’ “Sally had a dry wit and enjoyed a laugh. She also was very supportive of Billy’s frequent travels to the United States for several decades for research for  books he wrote on the Scots-Irish Ulster-Scots migration and settlements.

They were in Knoxville in East Tennessee with an Ulster-Scots group.“Sally enjoyed good food, best holidays and she liked to dress in fine clothes. Over their time together, many happy holidays were spent in Portrush, Bournemouth, Scotland, Spain, Italy , United States and Canada. The  Canada holiday was particularly enjoyable as they travelled over the Rocky Mountains by train from Calgary and Toronto to Vancouver. It was the holiday of a letime!. “Sally, like Billy, also loved American country music and enjoyed going to concerts in Belfast to hear the leading American singing stars. She was also a fan of Daniel O’Donnell, and, of course a big Elvis Presley fan.“Sally’s stroke on April , , was a harsh, le-changing blow to not only herself, but to Julie and Billy also. She lost her speech and was immobilised down the right side. Her time spent in hospital and in Rosemount care home in Portadown lasted two and a half years, but the medical and nursing staff there provided top quality care which complimented the love and devotion of her family. “She became an integral part of Rosemount, and the family is indebted to everyone there for their   work with a special lady, who was a model patient in challenging circumstances.”Danny added: “Most importantly, Sally was a woman of simple dedicated Christian faith who every night got down on her knees to pray to God, her Saviour and friend. Her values were of the highest standard. Sally will live on in our hearts and her memory will be cherished by all who knew and loved her as a devoted we, mother, mother-in-law, grandmother, sister and aunt, and friend to all those who came to know her. In Billy’s words - ‘Sally was a class act, loved and respected by everyone in her own family and wider community. “Sally loved her family her family loved her. We thank God for her le and His goodness to her. We believe that Sally, as a person of faith, the scripture verse from nd Corinthians, printed at the bottom of her death insertion is appropriate - “absent from the body, present with the Lord”.”Danny expressed thanks to the Rev Mark McMaw and the Rev Stephen Kennedy for conducting the service and the organist.

marketThree months after failing to attract any bidders, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough is set to re-release the tender for the management of Portadown town market.By The NewsroomFriday, th September , : amUpdated Friday, th September , : am  \"       \"  Following discussions of the matter at a meeting of Council’s economic development and regeneration committee on Tuesday, September  a Council spokesperson told the local democracyreporting service the tender will be advertised the week ending Friday, October .“The tender will be advertised until Friday, October  and Council would ideally like to have an operator in place by January , , subject to statutory approvals,” said a Council spokesperson.“Once the tender has been advertised, interested parties will be able to apply through theeTenders NI portal.”During the committeemeeting, members were provided with an update on the regeneration of Portadown town centre and the role a high quality local market will play in this.They were advised that following Council’s decision to bring its service level agreementwith the market’s former operator, Portadown , to an end, five expressions of interest were receivedfrom parties interested in operating and managing a market in the town.Following a public consultation a tender was advertised on Friday, May  and closed on Friday, June , no tenders were receivedas part of the procurement process.Since then, Council has been in ongoing consultation with traders in Portadown to reassure them of Council’s plans to locate the market in a section of the Magowan West car park.It is understood Council is keen to see the market operate two times a week with optional daytime or evening operational times.Commenting on the report, Councillor Lavelle McIlwrath askedCouncil had consulted with the former market’s traders.Council’s head of regeneration, Nicola Wilson said Council has had a “busy summer” talking to traders and businesses through its consultation hub but had not been involved in direct consultation with the previous market’s traders.“In relation to the consultation with the existing market traders, we have not done that as we did not think it was an appropriate thing to do,” said Ms Wilson.“They are looking for a covered market space and that is not something we are going to be able to provide for them.“We have spoken to a lot of the town’s traders and a lot of the traders along Woodhouse Street as well to clary what we really want.“We will soon be in a position to go out with a tender that is more precise and detailed, I think that was probably one of the stumbling blocks in our first attempt to get a market provider in.“We are looking for an appropriate organisation to come in and provide the market service and that agent will be the one that will be liaisingwith the markets traders to try to develop what they need within the offering they have.”Read this - Club rallies round after child’s bike stolenEditor’s message:Thank you
