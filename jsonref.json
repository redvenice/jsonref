For many, the unprecedented nature of this year has had a negative effect both physically and mentally, but with the end of the year fast approaching and the promise of a fresh start in 2021, now is a great time to give mind, body and soul a much needed overhaul.“This year, few of us have looked after ourselves the way we deserve to be looked after,” says personal fitness and strength trainer Matt McCormack (@mattmccormackpt). “Due to no fault of our own, we’ve neglected to give our bodies what they need, and anxiety and stress levels for many have been understandably sky-high. The temptation may be to put off making changes until the new year, but now is actually the ideal time to toughen up our bodies if we want to face the winter and life’s next chapter in the best possible shape.”So whether your aim is to feel trimmer, stronger or happier, the time is now – and yes, whatever the weather.1 Give booze a breakIf that sounds like a ridiculous suggestion with the festive season just around the corner, you don’t have to go completely dry as a bone, but a more mindful approach to how much – and what – you’re drinking could make a huge difference to your physical and mental health. “We all know that drinking to excess isn’t great for our bodies, so implementing some small changes to your drinking habits is really beneficial,” says nutritionist and founder of LunchboxDoctor, Jenny Tschiesche.“Try swapping some of your weekly alcoholic drinks for something like kombucha, which still feels special, treat-like and is very on-trend.”When choosing a non-alcoholic drink, keep an eye out for the sugar content – check the label and choose those drinks that are green for sugar when you can. It’s also a good option to aim for some entirely alcohol-free days throughout the week, so try downloading Public Health England’s Drink Free Days app, which can be found on the Apple App Store and Google Play.2 Keep a journalMove over meditation, there’s a new tool in town to achieve a clearer, happier mind: writing. According to some mental health professionals, keeping a journalis one of the best ways to release mental blocks, understand your feelings and attain your goals. You may have kept a daily gratitude list to remind yourself of things to feel thankful for, but trying a more expressive approach to writing can be a way of hacking into the deepest parts of the brain, helping us recognise our needs.Invest in a nice notebook and aim to write for 10-15 minutes each morning. Think of how you’re feeling, what you’re worried about, someone you’re angry with, hopes for that day – and see what comes out.3 Download a fitness appSometimes we all need a helping hand, so why not lean on an app? Whether it’s to track your diet, plan a workout or record your daily physical activity, checking in with your phone or smartwatch is a great way to help you keep on top of your health and fitness goals – and set new ones when the time is right. “I see it all the time with my clients, especially during this time of the year,” says McCormack.“They lose track of what they’re eating or drinking, which then spirals into bad choices and habits, quickly followed by negative thoughts. But using a fitness app is a brilliant and simple way to regain some control and keep your health and fitness in order.”Apps such as MyFitnessPal are free to download and can help you keep an eye on what you’re eating, the number of steps you’re doing, and even make everything feel more manageable, which is often half the battle.4 Get a flu jabWith the spread of Covid-19, it’s easy to forget that it’s also important to protect yourself against the flu – especially so if you’re in a high-risk category for coronavirus, as research has shown you’re more likely to get seriously ill if you get the flu and contract coronavirus at the same time.The good news is that by getting a flu jab, you’ll help reduce pressure on the NHS and social care staff who may be dealing with the pandemic. Changes including social distancing, hand washing and wearing protective equipment have now been made to ensure it’s safe to get your flu jab at GP surgeries and pharmacies, so go and book one in for peace of mind.5 Seek out supportWinter can be lonely. Anything from weather conditions to potential restrictions due to the pandemic could keep us from loved ones this festive season. Plus the reduced sunlight can reduce our body’s production of serotonin, potentially making us feel low and more alone.Kate Lucey, author of Get a Grip, Love, says that right now we need to make the effort to talk to each other – but with our voices and not just a WhatsApp or text message.“We’ve become a bit scared of phone calls,” she says. “Don’t plan it, just dial. Send a voice note if they don’t answer, and even if you have to play phone tag you’ll get there eventually. Voice action is so much more nourishing than a message.”Conversation keeps us feeling connected so make a list of three people a day that you could contact – and make it happen. If you’re not able to get in touch with someone, or you’d just like to find out more about managing your mental health and wellbeing, head to nhs.ukoneyouevery-mind-matters.6 Invest in supplementsIt’s that time of year when we can’t make vitamin D from sunshine. To keep your bones and muscles healthy it’s best to take a vitamin D supplement every day between October and early March. This is especially important as many of us have been indoors more than usual this spring and summer.“The majority of us don’t get the sufficient amounts of vitamin D through our diet, and with sunlight limited at this time of year, in my opinion, we should all be supplementing,” says Tschiesche.You can get vitamin D from most pharmacies, and supermarkets and other retailers. Just 10 micrograms a day is all you need – it’s the same for the whole family.7 Stop smokingThinking of knocking smoking on the head in the new year? Why wait? By quitting now, you’ll reap the rewards almost immediately. Longer-term benefits include reducing your risk of lung problems, heart problems and various types of cancer. In the short term, if you stopped now you would be free of nicotine, finding it easier to breathe and have a pocket full of surplus cash by the time you’re singing Auld Lang Syne. Plus, you’ll have the hard bit out of the way.“Quitting smoking is always a fantastic idea,” says Dr Catherine McCullagh, a trainee GP. “But people don’t realise that you can feel the benefits immediately. Contact your GP or pharmacist about the various options available to help you quit – often they can refer you to a smoking cessation clinic where you will receive specialist advice.”8 Get outdoorsThe great outdoors might be wet and wild right now, but a winter walk (find one near you at walkingbritain) is the best way of blowing away the cobwebs. Fresh air has higher levels of oxygen than indoor air, so getting outdoors for a brisk 20-minute walk each day is good for your lungs, blood pressure, circulation and heart rate. Plus, more oxygen is thought to result in greater brain functioning, improving energy and concentration skills – perfect for anyone working from home.Entice your kids out with a homemade scavenger hunt. Make a checklist of 10 things – such as acorns, feathers, yellow leaves – and head to the woods, only returning when you’ve found them all. Not close to woodland? No problem. Even a walk around the streets with a list of items to spot – a black cat, three buses, Christmas trees in windows – can turn exercise into a fun, and free, game.9 Light a scented candleBurning a scented candle doesn’t just achieve peak winter ambience, it can also do wonders for your wellbeing. The combination of essential oils in some aromatherapy candles – such as lavender, rose or lemon balm – can relieve anxiety and reduce stress.And there’s more ... stuffy noses and congested chests can be eased by burning peppermint or eucalyptus. Sleep can be helped by a chamomile or sandalwood candle – just remember to blow it out before your head hits the pillow – and energy may be boosted by the scent of bergamot, cinnamon or ginger.10 Treat yourselfWhen it comes down to it though, 2020 has been hard enough. For long stretches of this year, we haven’t been able to enjoy a sit-down meal at a restaurant or the comforts of a Sunday roast at the pub. While it’s important for us to take care of our bodies, this winter really isn’t the time to start feeling guilty and deny ourselves a little taste of the good stuff. We’ve missed out on enough this year, thank you very much.So have a treat and reach for the chocolate when you want to, whether it’s milk chocolate, or dark chocolate – which is generally a bit lower in calories and sugar – just enjoy. Of course, moderation is key, but as Francesco Petrarch said: “A little bit of sweetness can drown out a whole lot of bitterness.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Following on from Land of Ibeji, Sanne de Wilde and Bénédicte Kurzen travel to Mojiang in Yunnan for the second chapter of their project about the mythology of twinhood. The area has an exceptionally high percentage of twins, celebrated in its annual tropic of cancer twin festival The first chapter of this project was called Land Of Ibeji. West Africa, and specifically Yorubaland, has 10 times more twins than any other region in the world. Ibeji, meaning “double birth” and “the inseparable two” in Yoruba stands for the ultimate harmony between two people. “Shuang bao tai”, 双胞胎 is the Chinese word for twin, which translates as: 双 double 胞 womb 胎 embryo.These legendary twin wells are located in the nearby village of Hexi, where 100 families have given birth to 10 sets of twins. Tales abound in local folklore, recounting how one pair of twins has transformed into two magic wells. The wells are a popular destination for newly wed couples, as the water is believed to increase fertility. It is said that many couples come to drink from the wells hoping to get pregnant with twins, especially important when China’s one-child policy was in place.Mojiang has been hosting the tropic of cancer international twins festival for the past 15 years, attracting thousands of twins and visitors from all corners of the world. The festival brings together the multiple dimensions of the role twinhood plays in Yunnan and in China: the Hani sun celebration, the unusually high twin fertility rate, the Taoist immortal figures, and recent Chinese government policies have all encouraged old religions and beliefs.Tales about twins abound in local folklore and in centuries-old Taoist traditions. In Mojiang, an entrepreneur saw the twin legend as a possible economic venture that could go hand in hand with the colourful sun festival of the Hani people. Now every year, thousands of visitors flock through streets crowded with vendors, while Hani people proudly wear their traditional outfits and sing songs.The more generic Chinese culture, which has been infused with the Taoist cosmology, philosophy and beliefs, uses an endearing representations of twins: “the laughing twins” or “He-He Er Xian”, which translate as “the immortals of harmony and union” and as the “two gods of harmony and union”, and are usually bald and smiling. These two immortals symbolise perfect partnership and express the idea that harmony is more profitable than strife, and are a centuries-old wedding gift.The photographic approach extends beyond appearance, to show the twin as a mythological figure and a powerful metaphor for the duality within a human being, and the duality we experience in the world that surrounds us. It reflects the “other”, the double, the doppelganger, our shadow self, our reflection in the mirror. This visual narrative and an aesthetic language, exploring new documentary strategies, is meant to reflect and empower the culture that celebrates twins, with symmetry, resemblance and reflections as tools.To highlight the “magical” and “supernatural”, to visualise that what can not be seen, two colour filters were used in certain pictures, amplifying the duality of two perceptions coloured differently. Purple referenced the mythology and storytelling: Mojiang is geographically tied to the tropic of cancer and is said to have a special “feng shui” and to be a ying-yang balancing point, which results in purple vegetables and the famous purple rice (a sign of prosperity and fertility) in the region. Blue is used to refer to water, the beginning of life and the magical twin wells.Layers of portraiture, double exposure, landscape and still life come together as a visual narrative translating the mythology of twinhood. Various photographic genres have duality as a key theme: the metaphor and the literal, the visible and the invisible, the material and the spiritual.There is a fascination for twins around the world. Although many of the myths and stories about twinhood have faded or been forgotten, it is a recurring theme weaving through biblical and cultural storytelling, philosophy and even science. Think of the Gemini stars Castor and Pollux, Romulus and Remus creating Rome, and Plato articulating the dual nature of humanity.The mythology of twinhood becomes a way to address themes such as identity, genetics, economy, religion, environmental issues, the one-child policy, censorship, cultural tourism and demographics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cff795fdd7e9b1fb1c1d89863c62d1d8b5a41fa/0_263_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355dc9f3ff402308bf8e9af5490f411d","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Protests in Paris, wildfires in California, a monolith in Utah, the conflict in Ethiopia and the enduring impact of Covid-19: the most striking images from around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b655adba461c848b12217bb31b5c661e57e19866/0_211_1707_1024/master/1707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b68d4026b198c4fa8783e0c21b290244","title":"the beauty of starling murmurations in pictures","story":"Copenhagen-based Søren Solkær , best known for taking photographic portraits of big names in music and film such as Björk and David Lynch, has spent the past four years capturing starling murmurations.

Öresund Bridge, MalmöA road and railway run parallel across one of the world’s longest cable-tied bridges then, at an artificial island, disappear into an underwater tunnel as if being sucked down a plughole.This incredible 16km (9.9-mile) structure seems to defy the possibilities of engineering, while creating a valuable trade and transport link between Copenhagen, in Denmark, and Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city. The Öresund Bridge section alone is about 8km (5 miles) long and will be familiar to British TV viewers as the setting for the Scandi-noir drama The Bridge.2. The Sauna in Frihamnen, Gothenburg In a land peppered with sleek designer sauna huts, both private and public, which showcase the ingenuity of talented architects, for one to be widely praised by design critics as the country’s most spectacular is quite an accolade. The Sauna in Frihamnen, which opened in a newly fashionable area of Gothenburg in 2015, immediately caused a sensation with its striking metal form, built from rusted corrugated steel. The design made extensive use of other recycled materials, too – 12,000 glass bottles were used in the construction of the changing rooms alone. Happily, it’s free for anyone to use, alongside an outdoor pool by the river in which to cool off.3. Treehotel, Luleå Swedish LaplandA global accommodation gamechanger when it launched its treetop cabins in 2010, the Treehotel has come to be one of the most recognisable and lusted-after places to stay in Scandinavia.Suspended 4-10m above ground in a spectacular Lapland pine forest are seven cabins, inidually designed by renowned architects, among them the Swede Bertil Harström, who is the only one to have created two treehouses – the UFO, resembling a flying saucer, and Bird’s Nest, whose exterior is a frenzied mass of sticks and branches.Guests go cross-country skiing through forest, watch the aurora borealis, kayak, and feast on gourmet meals of wild moose with foraged berries. There’s time, too, for fika picnics, which embrace the Swedish tradition of having a cosy break for coffee and cake with friends.4. Artipelag, VärmdöArtipelag, a vast exhibition centre that celebrates art, architecture, Swedish design and food, sits in a natural environment of pine trees, cliffs and magnificent views, about 20km (12.4 miles) east of Stockholm. The aim of the architect Johan Nyrén was to create a building in harmony with its surroundings and the elements. As a result, a crackling fire welcomes visitors into the entrance hall, from where they see seawater glittering through floor-to-ceiling windows. In the cafe and patisserie, a huge rounded gneiss rock protrudes through the floor. Outside, larch boardwalks skip across rocks and water to a sculpture trail through the forest. To make the visit even more special, gallery-goers can travel to Artipelag through the Stockholm archipelago on board a 19th-century ship.5. ArkNat shelters, High CoastEvery year since 2017, groups of young architecture students have taken to the 130km (81-mile) High Coast Trail in north-east Sweden to design and build beautifully crafted wind shelters and resting places for hikers as part of the ArkNat project. The High Coast, a Unesco world heritage site of granite cliffs and rocky islands, stretches from Hornöberget in the south to Örnsköldsvik in the north. Along the trail it’s a joy to stumble across and take time to appreciate the ArkNat spots, such as Forest Cradle, a curvaceous floating wooden day bed in the forest near Mount Skuleberget. For 2021, the project moves from the High Coast region to the southern county of Skåne to provide a fresh crop of inventive havens along glorious walking trails.6. Kalmar konstmuseum, KalmarOne of the country’s most interesting contemporary art museums, the Kalmar konstmuseum, on the south-east Baltic coast, was the result of an architecture competition that attracted almost 300 entrants. The winners, Martin Videgård Hansson and Bolle Tham, envisaged a black cube housing four floors of exhibitions, studios, a library and offices, with views over the sea and the city. In contrast to the dark, wood-clad exterior, the interiors are of smooth, pale concrete where light and shadow play. The Kalmar konstmuseum won Sweden’s most prestigious architecture prize, the Kasper Salin Prize in 2008, its inaugural year.7. Icehotel, Jukkasjärvi, northern SwedenThere can’t be a traveller on earth who hasn’t heard of the magical Icehotel, 17km (10.5 miles) east of Kiruna and 200km (124 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, which was the world’s first when it opened in 1989, and has reinvented itself extravagantly every winter since. Between October and December each year, dozens of artists and collaborators chip away at ice from the Torne River to form spectacular new suites – one may be full of ice toys, another a frozen winter garden. The newly created ice extravaganzas are available for occupation from mid December this year to the end of March, but one section of the hotel, Ice 365, now remains open year round, using solar energy to freeze rooms. If you can’t fit in an overnight stay, day visitors are welcome at the ice bar and exhibitions.8. Naturums, nationwideIn many countries, visitor centres at nature reserves tend to be lacklustre prefab cabins devoid of style. Not in Sweden, where 31 design-led naturums (nature rooms) in national parks and nature reserves are examples of architectural brilliance. The centres host activities, exhibitions and provide information about the beautiful areas they inhabit, yet even their own aesthetics are cause for admiration. Naturum Vänerskärgården-Victoriahuset’s facade of wooden strips, for example, was inspired by the reeds and driftwood of its surroundings at Lake Vänern – the EU’s largest lake – and features a hotel, too.9. Sara Cultural CentreNot far from the Arctic Circle, the city of Skellefteå is building the Sara Cultural Centre, which, at 20 storeys high, is expected to be the world’s tallest wooden building. Due to open in 2021, the structure will house a theatre, art gallery, museum and the city library. There will be a hotel and a restaurant, too, both of which will have panoramic city views. Designed by architect Oskar Norelius, this futuristic building pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved in timber construction, while at the same time having a low environmental impact thanks the renewable nature of wood. Additionally, its green roof will contribute to thermal insulation, enhance bioersity and delay rainwater run-off.10. National Museum, StockholmIf any building exemplifies Sweden’s ability to pay homage to its past while embracing the future, it’s the National Museum. Opened in 1866, it is not only one of Europe’s best preserved 19th-century museum buildings but one of the most modern thanks to a five-year renovation that was completed in 2018. While the building’s symmetrical facade was restored to its former glory using stone that matched the original, the interior was sensitively updated to allow more of the museum’s vast collection of art to be displayed in a contemporary manner. The museum also gained a glass roof, a lift and a new restaurant that serves classic Swedish cuisine with a modern touch, think elk stew with pickled red carrot or seared cured salmon with cucumber salad.Welcome to Sweden when the time is rightTo discover more about architecture and design in Sweden, head to Visit Sweden were you’ll find even more places you won’t want to missGet advice about travelling to Sweden, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at gov.ukforeign-travel-advicesweden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b256e746b79a35f6ae76347238900ec3b63d11/0_272_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a584eaf0b6766d034cee0d89ee0b9547","title":"teachers in the uk coronavirus what has this term been like","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers about their experience of managing this term during the coronavirus pandemic The start of this academic year has been unlike any other, with teachers managing student bubbles, staffing problems, and additional hygiene rituals.

Now, the palaeoecologist is reaching global audiences with a project that brings to life the microscopic world of pollen by producing giant 3D-printed models from high-quality scans of pollen grains.“Being able to identify pollen is important for many reasons,” he says. Because they can survive millions of years and are tiny and tough, they can help track changing climate patterns, reveal the quality of honey and even provide forensic evidence at crime scenes. “But I love seeing what else people do with the models,” he says. Already they have been used by bee ecologists in Brazil, US school teachers and Irish archaeologists, among others.Wilson’s quest to provide open access to scanning and printing pollen grains in 3D began after winning some money on the online teaching platform I’m a Scientist, Get Me Out of Here for his success in engaging students. He was determined to use the money to share his enthusiasm for pollen, which, he says, most people overlook as dust, except when they have hay fever. He recognised that providing open-access giant models of these tiny unique shapes would have enormous uses for science and education.He has since created a fast, free and accessible way for anyone to print outsize replicas of pollen grains, magnified 2,500 times, via his online 3D Pollen Project. So far, pollen from 35 plant species has been scanned and modelled and he is ready to get to work on the next 100 species sent to him from around the world, including from Europe, Colombia, Tanzania, Ecuador and Mongolia. “It was a long process of trying to figure out how to do it well. But we’re there, and so far they’ve been downloaded 2,500 times in 45 countries,” he says. “I’d like to create a broad spectrum with each branch of the tree of plant life represented, for researchers, schools and other users.”The project has found fans beyond the world of science. “I’ve had emails from mechanical engineers in Israel, fashion designers in Denmark, others in China, the Netherlands … it would be good to make mint pollen chocolates too! 3D printing also has huge potential to revolutionise teaching, especially while social distancing.”Wilson is now a final-year PhD student at the University of Reading, researching, by studying pollen, how climate change and indigenous cultures have influenced critically endangered araucaria forest trees in southern Brazil. He describes pollen shells as “the diamonds of the plant world, one of nature’s toughest materials. They act like a time machine, lasting for millions of years. They tell us how forests are shaped by climate change and people.”To create the 3D Pollen project, Wilson collaborated with Hull University and also had help from Cardiff University’s Bioimaging Research Hub and Dr Katherine Holt, a senior lecturer at Massey University in New Zealand who first developed a set of accurate, 3D-printed scale models of pollen up to 3,000 times their actual size. “The idea has received a lot of interest and uptake, but that should be credited to Oliver, he’s built the profile for the concept,” she says.Wilson’s first scans included pollen from several wind-pollinated European trees that are among the worst for inducing hay fever: oak, birch, alder, hazel, willow, pine and small-leaved lime. His models also include pollen from several important insect-pollinated wild flowers, including from an ox-eye daisy collected in Sweden that looks like a naval mine, that of a vibrant pink coneflower from Chicago botanic garden, plus grains from English meadow clary, ivy, fat hen, wormwood, meadowsweet, knapweed, heather and autumn hawkbit. Most of the pollen grains he has scanned and modelled are 100th to 1000th of a cm in size. Alastair Culham, associate professor of botany at the University of Reading, said: “3D printing has great potential in teaching. It’s the modern equivalent of the famous Blashcka glass flowers at Harvard. They were intended as scientific educational objects primarily, so fall into the same category as 3D printed objects now. They have become works of art but they are very technically precise models and the product of a unique combination of technology, skill and practise.“While printed technology might have the feeling of a mass-market product, those models still need cleaning and de-burring and there is a lot of skill in making the 3D computer model,” he adds. Tony Hayes at Cardiff Univeristy’s bioimaging hub has made 60 pollen models for science centres, plus a prehistoric swamp fossil insect, a giant head of a red ant and a zebra fish larva. “We also created pollen models from an archaeological dig called Footprints in Time, from 5,000 years ago,” he says.”Dr Alex Ball, head of imaging and analysis at the Natural History Museum in London, says exhibits of all sizes are now often being 3D scanned and printed or magnified.“Some exhibits are too small or fragile to handle, whereas these can be made cheaply and replaced easily,” he says. “This is one way of making a collection more accessible. We are exploring how to use them to teach visually impaired people about microscopy. This includes 3D prints of sand and sugar grains, insect heads and coins.”The museum recently worked with artist Emma Gibson on scanning, magnifying and printing grains of sand from a beach, turning them into car-sized sculptures called Quicksand, exhibited at Selfridges in London and destined for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.Dr Paul Wilson at the University of Warwick, who hosted an online symposium this week on the future of 3D visualisation in cultural heritage which brought together museum experts and scientists, says: “Covid is forcing museums to do a whole plethora of different levels of immersion and think in new ways.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c496286f51d97121e1af149588cb2464f5ec64f3/1238_403_6986_4192/master/6986.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6c200208134e3aa37cdae325700790ec","title":"taking a knee is a sign to minorities they are welcome at football grounds","story":"Millwall fans desecrating the gesture has caused tension in south London and changed the agenda for QPR’s visitThere is a famous, perhaps apocryphal tale about the Millwall end throwing a hand grenade on to the pitch at Griffin Park in November 1965. That story is often taken as an example of extreme Millwall hostility. In fact it was a joke (the grenade was a harmless blank).Fast-forward more than half a century and something similar was lobbed on to the pitch at the Den in the moments before kick-off on Saturday. Except, this one isn’t a dud. And its explosive effects are far from over.It is hard to know what to make of the news that Millwall and QPR players will now link arms before kick-off on Tuesday night at the Den “in a show of solidarity for football’s fight against racism”.This is clearly a case of damage-limitation – and too little, too late for a club, in Millwall’s case, who knew this was coming weeks ago, failed to respond to the warning signs, and have yet to work out a way to placate both their fans and the demands of the outside world. The damage is out there, though. And it won’t be solved by a clapping circle.It is also hard to overstate the effects of the sustained booing from the home fans before kick-off against Derby. The boos were directed at Millwall’s players for taking a knee against discrimination, and specifically racism. They were also in evidence at Colchester. Social media is awash with supportive messages purporting to speak as fans of other clubs. This is a very real point of tension.There doesn’t seem much point at this stage in dwelling on the extraordinary lack of respect shown toward those for whom such gestures have a deep and personal meaning. Or on the inability to remain silent for five seconds if your politics preclude you from sharing the moment.Not to mention the fact those involved must realise that booing – not ignoring, but actually pissing all over – a gesture that expresses anti-racism is by its nature a racist act.Yes, really. Call it what it is. No need to hide behind the trumped-up connection to Black Lives Matter UK, a fringe organisation that has nothing to do with English football and which doesn’t really exist in the everyday lives of anyone concerned, other than as a distant enemy in the culture wars.As for the idea this was a response to having “politics” inserted into our football grounds, well, politics are everywhere. Ignore them if you like. That is one of the freedoms we have.The idea that BLM UK is simply an unignorable enemy, Marxist anarchists currently threatening our very way of life, is laughable.Neither the Premier League nor the EFL have any formal connection to this small, fringe organisation (the EFL’s anti-racism slogan is Not Today or Any Day, a terrible slogan, but not a political one).Plus, of course, BLM UK in no sense “owns” or defines the taking of a knee, which goes back at least as far as the civil rights movement. For many people who have experienced prejudice, taking a knee at football is a sign they are now welcome in these places, that their children can safely come, that acceptance awaits them not hostility.A statement of personal interest: I have been going to The Den, old and new, for 35 years. I can see the ground from my front door. Via these pages I helped to stop Millwall being forced out of the Den a few years back but I know also that simply writing this article will cause huge offence.There will be fans who see it as a betrayal of the club to point out the hurt caused on Saturday. This is incorrect. It is instead an act of despairing love and a refusal to allow this version of Millwall, south-east London or modern life – tribally angry, consumed by the wider culture war – to drown out everything else.The other side of this discourse is also incorrect: the urge to pile on, to dismiss everything and everyone here as defective human matter, a bad lot to be given up on.

These are changes that actually matter, because this is where the rivers meet, a football club that exists in one of the few remaining ungentrified areas of inner London.It is an attractive fiction for some to maintain South Bermondsey was always a hive of far-right activity (the National Front was chased out of Millwall in the 1970s). But we do know that racism exists in society. We know that it exists where tensions are felt most keenly. When an institution like Millwall FC promote anti-racism, when it works to break barriers down – as the community trust has – when the people in the ground become more mixed (as they have), when black players are routinely voted player of the year (a small thing but still the case) then this is actual progress in a place where it is felt, not just a gallery of the pre-converted.Club, fans and community trust have been proud of this progress but it has also now been beaten into tiny pieces with the bluntest of clubs.There has been some talk already this week of internal meltdown, with disenchanted employees considering their positions and long-standing home-and-away fans who feel bereft, betrayed and humiliated.This may now get much worse. Millwall play QPR on Tuesday night with that pin already pulled. A group of 2,000 home fans will again be present. Both teams intend to take a knee. The talk around the place is that at least one player is prepared to leave the pitch if the boos are repeated.The Den has always been a place of naysaying, of fuck-yous, of comically cussed hostility. For all the upset caused, it is still the case that no one can or will be punished for booing. This is also one of our freedoms.But the delusion here is that by booing the taking of a knee those present are standing up to some greater power, refusing to be told by those in charge, taking back control.This is entirely back to front. There is nothing to be gained from disempowered people squabbling among themselves. The best fuck-you in the world is the one directed towards those with actual influence, those who do actually have the power to deny you opportunity or freedom a fuck-you that involves punching up not down.The club itself has the power to intervene here, to set an example and to lead. The anger that led to Saturday was a long time brewing, germinated in part, it seems, by a failure to adequately accommodate the club’s remembrance game in November.For now south-east London holds its breath. Some still maintain this was about politics. It has been made quite clear, and from many sides, that it looks and feels like racism. An escalation will pose the question of how exactly the club can survive such contortions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dea521ed870cedd162695c6f324c78529382496/360_0_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=86309fb83682e28a2d4240756fa116ba","title":"tell us what are your best tips for recovering from a hangover","story":"We’d like to hear your tips for avoiding a sore head in the morningChristmas and New Year celebrations will take place on a much smaller scale in 2020 – but that doesn’t guarantee they’ll be hangover-free.

The balance of –6 percentage points was the lowest among 24 countries studied.Mark Cahill, managing director of ManpowerGroup UK, said: “The headline numbers are steadily moving in the right direction, and we are seeing a continued resurgence in key sectors like finance and business giving us reasons to be cheerful as we head into 2021.Retail and hospitality employ about 6 million workers between them, but Manpower said both had felt the impact of the four-week lockdown in England from 5 November to 2 December, with hiring intentions at their lowest level on record. Record lows were also reported by London employers.Cahill said: “The further decline of Britain’s high streets is deeply concerning. Shops, restaurants, and bars have remained mostly shut across the country, and the young people who make up a large proportion of workers in this sector have often borne the brunt.“London’s shuttered shops are a stark reminder of the economic impact of the pandemic. Many of the city’s largest companies stuck to their hiring plans at the start of the first lockdown but are now adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach, deferring hiring until the impact of the EU exit and Covid-19 in the new year is clearer.”Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said: “November saw the brakes put on the sales growth that had been seen over the previous three months. In-store non-food sales saw a significant decline as a result of the lockdown in England however, some retailers were able offset a proportion of lost sales through greater online and click-and-collect sales, ensuring they could still serve their customers.“Extended discount periods helped spread demand and offered customers great deals on gifts including the latest gaming consoles, other electronics and home accessories. However, the disparity between online and in-store non-food sales widened, with the highest online penetration rate since May. Non-food stores once again experienced double-digit decline as tighter restrictions were brought in across England.”Paul Martin, KPMG’s UK head of retail, said: “The evolution of Black Friday from a day to now ning multiple weeks has further distorted trading patterns and will have likely brought Christmas purchases forward. Despite this, high-street retailers will still be hoping that consumers will be pounding the pavements in the coming weeks as they battle hard to make up for lost ground in this crucial time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d87e5988aed12d250a4918b7ccad897cf05bb57/0_112_3027_1816/master/3027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f05069b8f90273d5ca98f97bc4bc45","title":"englands george ford kicking is part of giving us best chance to win","story":"England’s unpopular kicking strategy has been defended by the fly-half George Ford who says he and his side are simply doing what it takes to be successful under rugby’s current laws.Eddie Jones, the England coach, believes criticism of the tactic is “disrespectful” to the players and Ford also rejects the theory it makes the game less interesting. According to Ford, the Autumn Nations Cup final victory against France on Sunday is further evidence of England’s approach bearing fruit, despite widespread public scepticism.“We understand where the game is at and what we need to do to try and win games,” the Leicester fly-half said. “Ultimately, that’s probably why we’ve won a few games recently. People are entitled to their opinion, but we’re the guys that run out on the field and we want to give ourselves the best chance of winning. We believe that’s the best way to do it.”Like Jones, Ford is adamant kicking is not boring if it is done effectively. “I know it can be frustrating for people watching but it’s fascinating in the sense it’s a game of patience. There’s a lot of information, composure and control needed to do the right thing and then also be ready to attack at the right time as well. We had a few opportunities to move the ball and challenge France … we just need to execute a little bit better on the edges.”The players also do not believe excessive pragmatism risks alienating old and new fans alike. “I don’t think so, no,” Ford said. “There are still opportunities in the game to attack and score tries. People can get excited about the defensive part of the game as well. You see players like Tom Curry and Sam Underhill consistently smashing people and that’s also part of the game. It’s a big part.“It’s just a cycle where the game is at. We want to put in a plan to make sure we win games. The young guys coming through at grassroots level want to see a successful winning England team. That’s what we need to do to put a smile on their faces.”Ford also paid tribute to Owen Farrell, who missed four penalty attempts before slotting the winning sudden-death kick. “I had no doubt he was going to do that. To miss four – which I’m sure he’ll fix – and then step up and nail that difficult kick from the left-hand side just shows the type of guy he is. It takes some real mental strength.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0bd1e1a79e4b7695451d239d31155e23a9a91a/0_41_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edcd67a688720310c066dd3e5d79003d","title":"england to fly home after south africa odi series called off due to covid 19","story":"England’s one-day international series in South Africa was cancelled on Monday after collective anxiety swept through the touring party and left the players feeling unable to perform on the field.A day of fraught meetings between players and management resulted in a 3.10pm announcement local time that the remaining matches were off. Notably, however, the team are set to remain in Cape Town until their scheduled departure via charter flight on Thursday.It follows an apparent loss of faith in the biosecure arrangements on tour and, after five positive Covid-19 cases in the space of three days, including two among the tourists, a sense that the cricket had become secondary.A joint statement from Cricket South Africa and the England and Wales Cricket Board claimed the decision was mutual and taken “to ensure the mental and physical health and welfare of players from both teams”.England’s two unnamed positive cases – believed to be a player and a coach – came after the games at Newlands on Friday and Paarl on Sunday were called off. But the veracity of these results has been questioned by Dr Moiz Moghal, England’s team doctor on tour. Both men have since undergone rapid Covid-19 tests that came back as negative, with the results of additional PCR tests expected on Tuesday morning.Despite the likelihood of the results being clear, Ashley Giles, the director of England men’s cricket, listened to wider concerns from the squad that began when two South Africa players tested positive at the start of the trip.He said: “The thing that really raised the levels of anxiety and nervousness were that we were coming into a biosecure environment and from very early on it appeared it wasn’t biosecure.Giles confirmed he and other staff members will stay in South Africa if the two England cases are confirmed, with the pair needing to isolate in their rooms for 10 days from their initial test on Saturday and therefore unable to travel until 15 December.He added the squad’s problems were likely not just a result of the past three weeks but rather a buildup from months spent in biosecure bubbles during the English summer and, for a number of players, the recent Indian Premier League in the United Arab Emirates.This brings other tours into question, with England’s Test squad due in Sri Lanka on 2 January for a two-match series – rearranged after its postponement in March – before four Tests, three one‑day internationals and five Twenty20s against India.Five members of the white‑ball group – Sam Billings, Jason Roy, Liam Livingstone, Jake Ball and Lewis Gregory – still intend to fly to Australia after this trip, undergoing 14 days of quarantine before playing in the Big Bash League. Tom Curran, however, has joined Tom Banton in opting to cancel his contract and fly home.Asked to detail the concerns England had with the biosecure bubble, with both teams staying at the Vineyard Hotel and playing at two grounds, Giles said: “I don’t want to go into any of those details. That’s for CSA to investigate. But as far as I’m aware we haven’t identified a ‘patient zero’ or the source of the infection.”Addressing these issues will be key for the financially impoverished home board, with visits by Sri Lanka, Australia and Pakistan still to come this season.However it transpires they will not lose the estimated £1.5m in broadcast revenues for this initial cancelled series if, as was hoped on Monday, they are able to successfully reschedule it down the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15ee3865dcc4d779b349f18a82561b832e43ac1/0_108_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b72b5a25818851058ffaecc0595f4f4b","title":"south africa left to count the cost after edgy england opt for safety first","story":"An increasingly nervous England decided against taking any further risks on a tour that has highlighted the problems international sport still faces during the pandemicCape Town was overcast for much of the day on Monday but around 3pm, just as word came through that England’s ODI leg of the tour of South Africa was off, blue skies and sunshine broke out, showing off Table Mountain in all its glory.The mood in the England squad was in keeping with this change of weather, as increasingly anxious thoughts about forging ahead with the cricket while simultaneously dealing with a Covid-19 outbreak in the camp were replaced by a collective sense of relief.Despite two early positive cases in the South Africa squad at the start of the bubble, the Twenty20 series was staged in full. But since Friday the tourists had become agitated and having privately queried the efficacy of the so-called biosecure bubble since the start of the trip – albeit without offering specific examples – suddenly they had no faith in it whatsoever.A third South Africa positive had seen the one-day series opener at Newlands called off at the 11th hour and again in Paarl on Sunday when two members of staff at the Vineyard hotel were shown to have contracted the virus.Then came the tipping point for the tourists: a couple of their own were suddenly suspected cases and it did not take long for the management to be told that, with the prospect of more infections and a 10-day isolation period that would delay departure, this was all too much.Eoin Morgan is a powerful England captain, perhaps the most powerful in recent times following last year’s World Cup win. He made it clear four years ago when missing the tour of Bangladesh amid security concerns that he is unwilling to take the field if his mind is occupied elsewhere.This should have been a relatively straightforward tour by comparison, certainly one that appeared much less complex than the recent English summer. The quickfire trip involved two teams playing six white-ball fixtures at two venues and staying at one supposedly secure hotel.Yet despite the presence of enlarged squads, providing warm-up opposition and plenty of reserves in the event of any illness, South Africa’s first stab at biosecure cricket was unable to keep the virus out and thus provide the peace of mind off the field that Morgan and his players feel they need.There has been plenty of renewed praise for the England and Wales Cricket Board in recent days, having shepherded visits by West Indies (men and women), Ireland, Pakistan and Australia this year without one positive Covid result from the 10,000 tests dispensed. And few could argue this was not an impressive feat by Steve Elworthy and his ECB team.But after years of cricket’s global landscape being tilted towards the so-called Big Three, Cricket South Africa’s pockets are empty, while their leadership remains hugely unstable. Any English superiority here should be kept in check by these facts and the promise to return to play these ODIs must not be hollow.Relations between the two boards appear amicable on the surface but beneath there has been a spot of back and forth. An email from officials at Western Province appeared on ESPNCricinfo alleging that England broke protocols on Thursday by using nets that were outside of the agreed zones.England’s response was that the original practice pitches were “not acceptable” and, though they switched location, at no stage was “the safety and health” of players and coaches compromised. It may seem a petty quibble by the hosts but, by the same token, how would the ECB have viewed such a unilateral move by their guests during the summer? The tourists are now staying in the country until Thursday and in a heightened state of lockdown. Word comes from the bubble that face masks are now mandatory and social distancing is at its strictest.Curmugeons may argue that an overreaction from a group of fit young athletes has taken place, a view that will harden if the follow-up tests for England’s two positive cases provide them with the all-clear to leave South Africa alongside the other members of the party.But it is worth remembering that even in normal times, cricket is a sport that heavily taxes the mind. Marcus Trescothick (on this tour as a coach) and Jonathan Trott were praised for speaking up about the mental health problems that cut short their England careers and the current generation have seen the pressures increase.Until they are vaccinated – and Morgan has stressed cricketers should be low down the queue – their movements are limited to hotels and grounds.There is little escape on tours that previously offered a chance to take in the local surroundings, while the time they spend with their families has returned to levels witnessed during less enlightened times.With tours of Sri Lanka and India to come after Christmas, a packed home summer and then a winter of fives tours that includes a T20 World Cup and an Ashes campaign, there will be more cloudy days ahead. For South Africa, who must convince others to still tour this season, these are imminent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ec22c19b404868cc87d7ddbfda6ecade7af91c3/0_78_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc1ee9d02908a1f7914e31e266d005a","title":"study suggests ioc adjustment period for trans women may be too short","story":"World Rugby recently became the first sports federation to ban trans women from women’s rugby, citing “significant” safety risks and fairness concerns. But most sports still follow IOC guidelines from 2015, which permit trans women to play against biological women providing their testosterone remains below 10 nanomoles per litre – a figure higher than average biological female levels, which range from 0.12 to 1.79nmolL.However the new study, based on the fitness test results and medical records of 29 trans men and 46 trans women who started gender affirming hormones while in the United States Air Force, appears to challenge the IOC’s scientific position.The scientists conclude by saying “more than 12 months of testosterone suppression may be needed to ensure that transgender women do not have an unfair competitive advantage when participating in elite level athletic competition”.When it initially published its transgender guidelines five years ago, the IOC said its “overriding sporting objective is and remains the guarantee of fair competition”. However, its plans to lower the testosterone limit to 5nmolL came to nothing because the issue was so contentious. Instead the IOC indicated it wanted sports to implement their own transgender policies.When asked for its response to the new research the IOC said it was now working on a “a framework for voluntary guidelines on the basis of gender identity and sex characteristics”, adding: “Overall, the discussions to date have confirmed considerable tension between the notions of fairness and inclusion, and the desire and need to protect the women’s category, all of which will need to be reconciled. The IOC aims to release this framework in 2021.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90a60370579ffb4785360111fc5f792f96b98b2/695_692_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=587969a688a6e15789d491003e656c57","title":"amazon echo 2020 review the best sounding smart speaker under 100","story":"Pros: bass you can feel as well as hear, great sound, Spotify, native BBC radio, Alexa, Bluetooth, 3.5mm input, made of recycled materials, interesting design, AZ1 chip.Cons: potential privacy concerns of a smart speaker, Alexa-only, AZ1 chip not active outside US yet, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant, wider footprint compared with cylinder design."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02e628d0c655e7fbb6270701581ebdc2f68434b7/0_314_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n\u0026s=8cd827be2f793ab8547fc14a7ad007c3","title":"georgia recertifies election results confirming bidens victory","story":"Georgia has re-certified the state’s results in the 3 November presidential election after two recounts, confirming again that the Democratic president-elect, Joe Biden, won the state.“It’s been a long 34 days since the election on November 3,” Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said in a press release on Monday. “We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged.” He added: “Continuing to make debunked claims about a stolen election is hurting our state.Georgia conducted a full hand recount shortly after the election, which showed Biden still leading by about 13,000 votes. Despite that hand recount, Donald Trump’s campaign requested another recount because of the narrow margin of Biden’s victory.That recount has now confirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia, making the president-elect the first Democrat since Bill Clinton to carry the state.Shortly after that announcement was made, Trump again lashed out against Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp. The president has repeatedly called for a special legislative session in the state to once again challenge the election results, a request that Kemp has reportedly declined.Raffensperger said on Sunday that a special session to overturn the state’s election results “would be then nullifying the will of the people”.Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, a Republican, told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday that he did not support Trump’s call for a special legislative session.“Calling the general assembly back in at this point would almost be along the lines of a solution trying to find a problem,” Duncan said. “And we’re certainly not going to move the goalposts at this point in the election. We are going to continue to follow the letter of the law, which gives us a very clearcut direction as to how to execute an election.”The president staged a rally in Valdosta, Georgia, on Saturday night in which he repeatedly falsely claimed he won the state.

We are the biggest oil producer in the EU. We have, since the 1970s, to a large extent financed our welfare state with oil money. So to say, ‘stop’, and to pay the cost for that, is a big deal for us.”In recent months, Jørgensen and Denmark’s prime minister have come under criticism for over-reliance on technical solutions, such as two “energy islands”, which together will generate 5GW of wind energy, and foot-dragging on issues like green tax reform.Jørgensen said he hoped Friday’s announcement would show his government’s green promises were sincere “I think there’s an English expression ‘put your money where your mouth is’, and that is basically that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said.He said the centre-right opposition Liberal party also deserved credit for backing the cancellation of the current exploration licensing round, something it had long opposed.“This is an example of what has changed in Danish politics, that we now really do have a broad support for the green transformation,” he said. “Political parties that a decade ago would have never even have thought about this are now on board.”The deal is binding on all future governments.“That’s important, of course, because when we then tell the world that we will do this, they can count on it, but also for the industry, because it gives them some stability and certainty,” Jørgensen pointed out.“Obviously, the industry is not happy about the cutoff date. They’re not happy about us having cancelled the tenders. But on the other hand, I think they will be happy about knowing exactly what conditions they have. Because when we say 2050, then that also means we’re not going to change that to 2045 or 2040.”Under the agreement, oil companies with existing licences in the Danish North Sea will be able to continue exploring for oil and gas in them.“If we were to say to companies that already had the permissions, ‘we’re taking them away from you’, the price tag on that is one that no government would be able to bear,” he said.“The costs would be so enormous that I doubt that we would be considered a frontrunner. People would just shake their heads and think we were stupid.”Jørgensen claims his government’s existing actions have already brought Denmark a long way. “We need to reduce by 20 megatons between now and 2030, and we’ve already reduced by five. We have 10 years to do it, and in one and a half years, we’ve done a fourth of that,” he said.Jørgensen has also been spending much of his time since his appointment last year on international outreach. Unfortunately, he said, some of the countries that looked likely to follow Denmark’s example had had their plans knocked off course by the coronavirus crisis.“The pandemic has unfortunately put good developments to rest in some countries … I hope that this doesn’t mean that too many countries forget that we have another extreme and more long-lasting crisis, which is the climate crisis.”He said it was crucial the world did not repeat the mistakes made after the financial crisis in 2008 and ert stimulus spending to “old-fashioned technologies”.Jørgensen said he was not worried that US president-elect, Joe Biden, would be insufficiently radical.“I have total confidence that the Biden administration will bring huge progress to the American transformation on the green agenda,” he said. “I’m just extremely pleased when I see such progressive forces being given the power, and I think all the signs that we’ve had from the president-elect and his team are pointing in the right direction.”The four years of climate backsliding under Donald Trump, he said, should not be seen as fatal for efforts to keep global heating to an acceptable level.“In a lot of the inidual cities and states, there has been some progress that can be built on, so I don’t subscribe to the standpoint that there has been irreversible damage,” he said. “Now, when the US are re-entering, I’d say that it can give us a new momentum.”With Friday’s announcement, Denmark has gained the moral power to punch above its weight. “In most countries, politicians will often say ‘This is a historic decision’. Sometimes it’s true, other times it’s not. With this one, we don’t even have to say it ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c319ce3878359475755bf4df18ecc38a0fb1e1/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f5e89ab8f34804824f48f5b68096aaa","title":"are you getting the pfizer coronavirus vaccine this week in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to people who are due to be given the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine in the coming daysThe Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is due to be rolled out in the UK this week, with the first people to receive doses on Tuesday.

Nor has the economic fallout been a leveller.”He called on the government to “get behind a proper examination of the issues of how Covid has impacted on inequality, particularly on the delivery of their levelling up agenda” and added: “It’s made the task harder of levelling up but also made it more urgent. And the truth is, we don’t have a levelling up plan from the government, we don’t have a cabinet minister … we simply don’t have a level of leadership with this agenda.”The link between deprivation, ethnicity and an increased risk from Covid-19 has been well established, with black African men nearly four times more likely to die from the disease than white men, according to the UK’s Office for National Statistics. analysis shows for the first time how these disparities exist even among communities living side by side. It drills down to more than 300 neighbourhoods comprising nearly 2.7 million people in England’s 10 local authorities with the highest infection rates, almost all of which are post-industrial towns in the north-west.It found that across England, average salary was likely to indicate an area’s infection rate, meaning places with higher average earnings were more likely to have fewer Covid-19 cases. But in the 10 worst-hit local authorities, an area’s proportion of BAME residents had a stronger correlation to its case rate, compared with salary, age and deprivation.In these 10 worst-hit councils, the 26 areas with a majority of BAME residents and an average salary of below £25,000 had experienced 7.1 cases per 100 people. This is almost double the average rate in the 22 mostly white areas where most people earn more than £35,000 a year.Tim Elwell-Sutton, an assistant director of the Health Foundation, described the findings as “very stark”: “You’re seeing areas right next to each other having very different experiences of the pandemic and that bring things home.”Residents from a BAME background are more likely to live in cramped housing with several generations under one roof, working in public-facing jobs in healthcare, hospitality or warehouses, and are more likely to use public transport, experts have said, increasing their exposure to Covid-19.“At least in part, these factors are a consequence of structural racism and it has left ethnic minorities more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic and could have been predicted,” said Elwell-Sutton.He urged ministers to put health inequalities at the heart of the government’s levelling up agenda, arguing that the focus on infrastructure and the economy risked leaving structural issues as “the preserve of the Department of Health”.He added: “If we’d been healthier at the start of the pandemic we would have done much better and particularly if that gap between the most and least deprived wasn’t as big then we would have found it easier to weather this.”Kerslake said the government needed to invest not only in infrastructure but also skills and combating deprivation, and properly fund local authorities to rebuild public health capacity. “If you were to pick out one thing that left us much more vulnerable to this pandemic it has been the denuding of resources for public health and local authorities,” he said. A failure to do so posed a “real risk” that existing health inequalities would widen, he warned.Prof Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said his area had suffered a “double whammy pandemic effect”, which he said was worsening the health and economic costs.Residents and businesses urgently needed more financial help from the Treasury, he said, adding that more deprived areas to be prioritised for the vaccine when it is rolled out more widely early next year. He called for a longer-term plan to move new middle class jobs to struggling northern towns post-Brexit.“The inequalities revealed by this analysis absolutely confirm our own local analysis,” he said.“We have higher Covid rates due to higher structural risks, so we risk being in tier 3 for longer, possibly months, and so our local economy is massively more impacted. This increases deprivation which is itself a major driver of higher rates of Covid-19 transmission.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95acb79708267f674958badceaf9a402c879a851/0_393_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5e86b8963874d89b14f6c54da4ef013f","title":"wales considers new covid lockdown amid rapid rise in infections","story":"Welsh health minister refuses to rule out more restrictions as hospital cases hit new highAnother lockdown may be needed in Wales to stop the NHS being overwhelmed as the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital soared to a record high.There are now more than 1,800 people in Welsh hospitals with confirmed or suspected coronavirus – the highest number recorded and 400 more than the previous peak in April.Describing the situation as “incredibly serious”, the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, accepted more restrictions might be needed, possibly even before Christmas.The figures come just a month after the end of a 17-day “firebreak” lockdown, which was believed at the time to have been successful and was expected to give the country a clear run up to the new year.But the Welsh government has since conceded that it might have been better to bring in other curbs when the firebreak was lifted.At a press conference on Monday, Gething said coronavirus cases were rising again across almost the whole of Wales. The country was the only part of the UK where infection rates were not falling at the end of November, he said.The minister said the latest data shows that the all-Wales case rate was almost 70 points higher on Monday than it was on Friday. “This shows you how just fast coronavirus is spreading,” he said.According to the latest UK government statistics, on 1 December Wales had a seven-day case rate of 267.8 for every 100,000 people. That compared with 149.5 in England, 143.6 in Northern Ireland, and 100.3 in Scotland.Gething said there were eight local authorities with rates higher than 400 cases for every 100,000 people – four times as many areas as on Friday. In 19 of the 22 local authority areas cases were rising.Asked how seriously the government was considering another lockdown, Gething said: “We’re actively considering each day whether the measures we have are the right ones or not. We’re actively considering what we may need to do after the Christmas period.”He added: “Everything is on the table. We’re discussing through this week, and we’ll continue to discuss, what measures we need to take.“We’ve learned that trying to have hard and fast commitments to never contemplate future action is just not the right or the responsible thing to do. So of course that’s an option that we’ll need to consider.”When asked if changes to the rules before or during Christmas could also be needed he said: “If we need to act at a different point in time we will do … If we need to act further we will do. We’re still committed to doing everything we can to keep Wales safe.”More restrictions in the hospitality industry came into force on Friday, which included banning licensed premises from serving alcohol and forcing them to shut by 6pm.Gething said effects from the new measures would not be seen for a fortnight. In recent weeks, shopping centres in Wales have been busy and there is fear that the virus is being transmitted in homes with the cold weather discouraging people from meeting outside.Swansea Bay university health board’s public health director, Dr Keith Reid, warned that Covid cases in the area could reach “catastrophic levels” unless people followed social distancing rules and said the health system would be overwhelmed if cases continued to increase at the current rate. He blamed people mixing with each other for the rise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b115284103dab1cddbea3a7df105aefb93d78636/0_138_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ee76d004cfa2bca9169da90ed13dc074","title":"one of first people in uk to receive covid jab says i feel its my duty","story":"Hari Shukla, 87, and his wife Ranjan to have first of two injections of PfizerBioNTech vaccineAn 87-year-old retired race relations expert from Newcastle will help make medical history when he does his “duty” and becomes one of the first people in the western world to have a Covid vaccine.“I’m so pleased we are hopefully coming towards the end of this pandemic and I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine”, said Hari Shukla ahead of receiving his jab. “I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help.”The PfizerBioNTech Covid jab is an mRNA vaccine. Essentially, mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (“transcribed”) into a piece of mRNA, which in turn gets “read” by the cell’s tools for synthesising proteins.In the case of an mRNA vaccine, the virus’s mRNA is injected into the muscle, and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins – which can’t by themselves cause disease – just as if they’d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that, studies suggest, lasts for some time.The two first Covid-19 vaccines to announce phase 3 three trial results were mRNA-based. They were first off the blocks because, as soon as the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 was known – it was\u0026nbsppublished\u0026nbspby the Chinese in January 2020 – companies that had been working on this technology were able to start producing the virus’s mRNA. Making conventional vaccines takes much longer.Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre, University of BristolShukla and his wife Ranjan, 83, will have the first of their two injections of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary on Tuesday morning, a week after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a coronavirus vaccine.“Having been in contact with NHS staff I know how hard they all work and I am grateful for everything they have done to keep us safe during the pandemic,” he said.Shukla is one of the 400,000 people who will be injected – in the shoulder, not the arm, as with most injections – as a priority at one of 50 hospitals around England because they are either over 80, live or work in a care home, or are an NHS worker with poor underlying health or whose work puts them at higher risk.Shukla was born in Uganda and studied at Exeter University. He later returned to Britain to work in race relations, first in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. He moved to Newcastle in 1974 when he became the director of the Tyne and Wear Racial Equality Council.He has been awarded an MBE, OBE and CBE for his work. In 2018 he published a book, the Art of Giving, about promoting better relationships between ethnic groups in Newcastle. The former teacher has also been honoured with a “local hero” plaque in the city.Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, hailed the start of the vaccine programme as a “turning point” in getting to grips with the Covid pandemic that has contributed to the deaths of more than 75,000 people across the UK and left more than 200,000 needing hospital treatment.“The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic. NHS vaccination programmes which have successfully helped overcome tuberculosis, polio and smallpox now turn their focus to coronavirus,” he said.Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, has warned that the rollout of the vaccine will be “a marathon, not a sprint”and will take months.The chief medical officers of the UK’s four home nations warned last Friday that “vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months”. NHS staff face several “hard months” before the vaccine starts in the spring to significantly reduce the number of people being hospitalised, and dying, they added.NHS leaders in England are worried that hospitals could struggle to cope in January and February amid a third wave of Covid and winter pressures, which usually descend at that time, the Health Service Journal reported on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc7df3b847334cbac2566e10bcd5601de09b6a19/0_49_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e148c152d2f3e5318c2ea2ccf21c0174","title":"coronavirus live news uk to start vaccinations on tuesday who criticises mandatory vaccines","story":"UK prioritising over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents France unlikely to end lockdown on 15 December Brazil to make vaccines freeIndia reported 26,567 new coronavirus infections, data from the health ministry showed on Tuesday, the lowest daily increase since July 10, according to a Reuters tally.Daily cases have been falling in India since hitting a peak in September.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the rules aim to reduce the “number of people on the streets”, echoing moves taken by authorities when cases spiked earlier this year.Dining out will be banned after 6 pm, beauty and massage parlours will be forced to close, and civil servants would be asked to work from home, she said.Hong Kong’s strict social distancing measures have largely helped keep infections to under 7000 in the city of 7.5 million, with 112 deaths.But daily recorded cases have risen again to more than 100 on several occasions in recent weeks, the highest level since July.Speaking ahead of a weekly meeting with policy advisers, Lam said “the strictness of social distancing measures must at least return to the level” of the outbreak’s peak in the city in July and August.Schools, bars and nightclubs have already been ordered to close.Lam did not say when the measures would come into effect, but added that the city’s health minister Sophia Chan would announce further details later on Tuesday.Last week Hong Kong reimposed social distancing measures at some of their strictest levels since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Restrictions on public gatherings were tightened with a maximum of two people allowed to meet, down from four.Authorities have also launched a hotline for residents to report social distancing breaches.A study that found US school closures during the Covid-19 pandemic cut the life expectancy of each child in primary school by an average of three months contains “critically flawed assumptions” and “clear mistakes in study design”, according to a rebuttal led by an Australian epidemiologist.The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on 12 November, was widely shared on social media including by scientists, doctors and policymakers and was covered in dozens of news stories.The researchers calculated the years of life lost that might be attributable to school closures, and compared that to the years of life lost attributed to the first months of the pandemic: Rebekah Jones, the Florida data scientist embroiled in a dispute with the state’s Republican governor over the handling of coronavirus figures, had her home raided on Monday by armed police who confiscated her computers.In a stream of posts on Twitter, Jones posted a video of the raid that showed state police carrying handguns escorting her out of her Tallahassee home. She can be heard saying: “He just pointed a gun at my children,” with her husband and two children apparently upstairs at the time.Jones claimed in her tweets that the raid was the work of Ron DeSantis, the governor with whom she has clashed repeatedly since she was fired by the state’s department of health in May in a row over Covid-19 data. She compared the incident to sending “the gestapo”, adding: “This is what happens to scientists who do their job honestly. This is what happens to people who speak truth to power.”The Florida department of law enforcement confirmed they had entered Jones’s house on a search warrant. But in a statement the department said the action was related to a recent computer hack of the health department website, in which emergency response coordinators were sent an unauthorised message: Here is our story on the Trump administration passing up a chance last summer to buy millions of additional doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, a decision that could delay the delivery of a second batch of doses until the manufacturer fulfils other international contracts.The revelation, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed to the Associated Press on Monday, came a day before Donald Trump aimed to take credit for the speedy development of forthcoming vaccines at a White House summit.Pfizer’s vaccine, one of the leading Covid-19 vaccine contenders, is expected to be approved by a panel of Food and Drug Administration scientists as soon as this week, with delivery of 100m doses – enough for 50 million Americans – expected in coming months: Hello! Helen Sullivan, back with you again. Besides aliens being real, what did I miss? America First... from Reuters:US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to ensure that priority access for Covid-19 vaccines procured by the US government is given to the American people before assisting other nations, senior administration officials said on Monday.The Trump administration is confident it will have enough vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants a vaccine by the end of the second quarter of 2021, one official said, disputing a New York Times story that the government declined when Pfizer Inc offered in late summer to sell more vaccine doses to the United States.Trump, who has faced sharp criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, is eager to take credit for the speedy development and distribution of a vaccine.One official said the executive order would lead to the formulation of guidelines for US government agencies to help other countries procure the vaccine once demand in the United States was met.It was unclear why an executive order was needed to ensure that the vaccines would be distributed domestically first, though the order appeared to be designed in part to underscore Trump’s “America First” philosophy ahead of the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.The White House is holding a summit on Tuesday to explain plans for vaccine distribution through Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which has been organising the effort. Trump and other officials will speak.Vaccine developers Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc will not attend.A White House official said the companies were not coming because they had active applications pending before the US Food and Drug Administration. A senior FDA official, Dr Peter Marks, is scheduled to address the Tuesday event.Representatives from Democratic President-elect Biden’s transition team were not invited to the summit. Trump, a Republican who lost the 3 November election to Biden, has refused to concede.Breaking news from Hong Kong:South Korea has signed a deal to buy Covid-19 vaccines for 44 million people, Yonhap news agency has reported, signing deals with four companies: Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Moderna, and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.South Korea reported 594 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday as the government prepared to outline its plans to secure enough vaccine candidates to potentially vaccinate millions of people next year. The elderly, frontline healthcare workers and first responders will be the first vaccinated.Unlike South Korea’s previous two waves of infections, which were largely focused around a handful of facilities or events, the new wave is being driven by smaller, harder-to-trace clusters in and around the densely populated capital city of Seoul.“If social distancing is not implemented properly, outbreaks in the greater Seoul area would lead to greater transmissions nationwide,” Kang told a meeting of health officials according to a transcript from the health ministry.South Korean President Moon Jae-in called on Monday for expanded coronavirus testing and more thorough tracing as infections continued to rise despite the imposition of increasingly restrictive social distancing measures.Health authorities predicted daily cases would hover between 550 and 750 this week, and possibly spike to as much as 900 next week.If such predictions are accurate, Kang said the country’s health system may collapse.“There could be a dangerous situation where it becomes difficult not only to treat Covid-19 patients but also to provide essential medical services,” he said.South Korea has now reported a total of 38,755 cases, with 552 deaths.China reported 12 new Covid-19 cases on 7 December, down from 15 cases a day earlier, the national health authority said on Tuesday.The National Health Commission said in a statement 10 of the new cases were imported infections originating from overseas.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to five from six cases a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 86,646, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.Mexico’s health ministry on Monday reported 6,399 new cases of coronavirus infection and an additional 357 fatalities, bringing the country’s totals to 1,182,249 cases and 110,074 deaths.The government says the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.A little more on Rudy Giuliani being diagnosed with Covid-19.President Donald Trump says the 76-year-old former New York city mayor is “doing well”, is not running a temperature, and is even up to presidential phone calls. No word on what the phone call was about. Giuliani remains in Georgetown University hospital.An 87-year-old retired race relations expert from Newcastle will help make medical history when he does his “duty” and becomes one of the first people in the western world to have a Covid vaccine.“I’m so pleased we are hopefully coming towards the end of this pandemic and I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine”, said Hari Shukla ahead of receiving his jab. “I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help.”Shukla and his wife Ranjan, 83, will have the first of their two injections of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary on Tuesday morning, a week after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a coronavirus vaccine: As countries begin deploying vaccines in the coming weeks and months, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged them to prioritise those most in need.“These are not easy decisions,” he said, setting out the WHO guidelines.AFP: Tedros said health workers at high risk of infection were a top priority, plus people at the highest risk of serious disease or death due to their age - thereby easing the pressure on health systems.He said they should later be followed by people with a higher risk of severe disease due to underlying conditions, and marginalised groups at higher risk.The WHO’s ACT-Accelerator mechanism, pooling risk and reward among countries rich and poor, is a global attempt to speed up the development of Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, and purchase and distribute them evenly regardless of wealth.However, the scheme needs $4.3 billion urgently, with a further $23.9 billion required in 2021.“What we need now globally is not to enter the land of empty promises in terms of supporting the ACT-Accelerator,” said Ryan, urging wealthy donors to stump up.“The means to do this allocation fairly and equitably is there. But what’s not in place is the financing to make that happen in 2021.“There’s too much of a gap between the rhetoric and the reality.”The World Health Organization said Monday that persuading people on the merits of a Covid-19 vaccine would be far more effective than trying to make the jabs mandatory, AFP reports. The WHO said it would be down to inidual countries as to how they want to conduct their vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus pandemic.But the UN health agency insisted making it mandatory to get immunised against the disease would be the wrong road to take, adding there were examples in the past of mandating vaccines use only to see it backfire with greater opposition to them.“I don’t think that mandates are the direction to go in here, especially for these vaccines,” Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s immunisation department, told a virtual news conference.“It is a much better position to actually encourage and facilitate the vaccination without those kinds of requirements.“I don’t think we envision any countries creating a mandate for vaccination.”O’Brien said there may be certain hospital professions in which being vaccinated might be required or highly recommended for staff and patient safety.But WHO experts admitted there was a battle to be fought to convince the general public to take the vaccines as they become available.Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest updates from around the world. You can find me on Twitter @helenrsullivan to ask me what I would like for Christmas. Britain is set to administer the first doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine on Tuesday, with the NHS giving top priority to people over the age of 80, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents. Meanwhile theWorld Health Organization said Monday that persuading people on the merits of a Covid-19 vaccine would be far more effective than trying to make the jabs mandatory.The WHO said it would be down to inidual countries as to how they want to conduct their vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus pandemic.Here are the key developments from the last few hours: "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses. It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat. As much as 70 per cent of Irish consumers’ virtual spending leaves the country as people shop overseas.It doesn’t have to be that way. As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies. That would save jobs and keep businesses going.So our 100 became 200, and is now becoming 400.Jump to: Toys Food and drink Art and gifts Jewellery Clothes Books Music and tech Sporty stuff Health and beauty Everything elseTOYS nimblefingers.ie  A Dublin toyshop that has been making children and their parents happy for generations.

File photograph: iStockAlmost as soon as the pandemic hit early this year, businesses, researchers, governments and iniduals all over the world started trying to figure out how the crisis would be likely to shape our world and our lives.They have also asked how many, if any, of the changes it has brought about – some of them virtually overnight – will endure. Since the start of the year, people in Ireland have broken off contact with all but their closest networks of friends and family. They have worked from home, holidayed at home and baked at home. They have stopped hugging people or shaking hands – even at funerals – and become a slowed-down and fearful nation who go online to buy their food.In Ireland, Bord Bia has been to the fore in working out what is happening to consumers – and what might happen next. Last spring it launched a project to see what impact Coronavirus would have on our habits. “We are in the middle of one of the biggest social experiments in our history and it will be fascinating to see how we change as a result of it,” said Rory McDonnell, Bord Bia’s head of strategic planning at the time. The research was interesting but unavoidably limited, in that it was carried out in the early weeks of the crisis when there was not a whole lot of data to rely on. We are about 200 days into the crisis now and Bord Bia has kept tracking consumer behaviour in Ireland and in a lot of other markets, including France, Spain and the US. Some new data is available. As in the first piece of research it has labelled the trends it has spotted, and as before, the first one it lists is “shielding”. It says this has continued to expand since the onset of Covid-19, with consumers turning to supplements and concepts such as food immunity to maintain their health.“The focus on health has continued to surge and people are taking a significant amounts of supplements, but there have also been changes in the type and amount of food we eat,” Bord Bia’s Grace Binchy says. Boosting immunityShe points to the number of people eating foods known to help boost immunity, which has climbed by 5 per cent to 34 per cent over the course of the crisis. However, she adds, it is not just about the food we eat. The proportion of people trying to improve their health more generally is at 44 per cent, up 8 per cent over the last six months. “Health was already a trend, but what we have seen is that Covid has accelerated certain behaviours,” she says. She points to the growing number of people swimming outdoors – or at least standing by the sea short in dryrobes – and the numbers going for walks. But could that not be sheer boredom? After all, we have only just come out of the second lockdown of the year and over the course of the six-week stretch to the end of November there was little else for people to do but walk – within 5km of their homes – or go for a quick dip in the sea so you could hang out with your dryrobed friends afterwards. “Our world did become so small and that is one reason, but there is more to it,” Binchy says.” There has been a focus on obesity for example, as people became aware of the heightened risk of adverse outcomes from Covid-19 among people who are overweight.While a trend that was identified as stocking-up manifested itself as “panic-buying” in the early stages of Covid-19, this behaviour has now changed and consumers are buying in a more planned and controlled way. Shoppers are now focusing more on a rolling stockpile as opposed to the more panic-based stocking up seen previously. They are also shopping smarter by focusing on freezer foods and products with longer shelf lives.According to the Bord Bia research, stockpiling is down 11 per cent to 30 per cent and is manifesting in different ways, with the panic-buying of recent times replaced by “controlled buying as a just in case”.Binchy then takes a mournful detour for a moment to say the top thing Irish people miss is spending time with friends, with 87 per cent of those polled listing it as the thing they miss the most – the highest number among all countries surveyed. With one in two people working much more from home now, if not exclusively, it is unsurprising that 40 per cent of people are missing the watercooler chats, while 71 per cent are missing casual dining.Then she is back to food. Comfort cooking has remained steady throughout the last few months and while it is not growing, there is still a firm focus on familiar favourites. Consumers have also been focusing on better-quality options to make up for the lack of food service and restaurant outlets.“I think we are maybe trading out some indulgent ingredients for more healthy options, also looking for more quality,” Binchy says. “A lot of people have not been going out at weekends so are rewarding themselves with meal kits and better quality food maybe because they want that nice steak on a Saturday night.”The number of people having less than healthy snacks and eating outside of meal times has fallen, and people are throwing out less food as they start to focus on waste and waists more. Daily routinePersonal safety has become an even bigger part of our daily routine, and compliance with mask-wearing, at almost 90 per cent, is much higher in Ireland compared to the US and Europe. That trend has also seen hygiene playing a choice in supermarket selection, and consumers say they will choose supermarkets on the basis of safety regulations, rather than simply cost.“People have this heightened sense of alert while over half of Irish people are looking to reduce the amount of time they spend shopping,” she says. “We have seen new methods of delivery emerge and 24 per cent of grocery shopping is now done online, an increase of 7 per cent since May. “The good news is, that has given rise to this idea of the savvier shopper. When shopping online it is easier to compare prices and to work out how much you have spent, and you put things in and take things out of your basket. It enables a more disciplined and financially rewarding experience.” While it’s likely that we will have expended our personal bandwidth on “online social”, online social fatigue has set in and getting back to being with our friends is what people really want. The research suggest that Irish people are missing their friends “more than any other country”. Consumers are also using strategies to make their food go further and cut down on waste – and not before time. According to a report published last month by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), our inability to properly police what is in our fridge is costing us as much as €700 a year while contributing to the climate catastrophe.The EPA report suggested that more than two-thirds of Irish people say the main reason they throw out food is because it has past its use-by date, while only 10 per cent said they were any good at keeping on top of what they have in their fridge. But the most damning statistic was that Irish households produce over 250,000 tonnes of food waste per year at a cost of €700 per household. Not only is money being wasted, but food that ends up in the bin is a significant contributor to climate change and responsible for about 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. So while the EPA continues to warn us on our wastefulness, Bord Bia is suggesting that since Covid, there is a greater awareness and conscientiousness about food waste and its impact on the environment. However, there is a growing tension emerging around packaging, as safety is likely to take precedence for many in making their food choices.Unsung heroesA new indicator identified looks at how society is adapting and working together to provide support during Covid-19. “There has been strong cause to champion those who are the unsung heroes: the train drivers, the delivery drivers, to the retail workers, to the cleaners in the hospital environments. The research highlights consumers’ belief that the continuation of normal life and services is important, with supermarkets and food producers playing a highly valued community role.”When asked whether Covid-related habits will endure, Binchy says she can’t say for sure but suggests some might. “I think to some degree some of the shielding habits will stick with a certain cohort. The health trend has been on the up for a long time and we are still learning about the benefits of some food and some supplements, like Vitamin D for example.”She leaves us with a not entirely cheery thought when she points out that it will be a long time before anyone forgets the impact Covid has had, adding that there are well over half a million types of virus lurking on the planet, with treatments available only for a tiny fraction of them. “I really think our relationship with the world and how we interact has changed,” Binchy concludes. “ We are starting to see the emergence of the more self-sufficient consumer and people are growing more, cooking from scratch more, although they might be baking a bit less than in May.” She also points out that buying local is more important, with 39 per cent saying they consider shopping locally more relevant than before the crisis.

Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general in the Department of the Taoiseach, said there had been reports of demand for buses and taxis around the same time due to the uniform 11.30pm closing of the hospitality sector now in place. With projected travel into the State significantly down on normal levels, Ms Canavan urged people who did not have an essential reason to come back to Ireland to stay away at Christmas. “Looking at the travel projections for the Christmas period, we expect air passenger numbers to be about 90 per cent down and last year’s figures and ferry passengers numbers to be about 60 per cent down. Most people who normally travel aren’t coming home for Christmas. This is a great sacrifice and one we should all be grateful for,” she said.She also addressed reports that some restaurant and pub owners are finding it difficult to convince people to come off the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. She said even those returning to work this week could still expect a bonus payment for Christmas, and they would be eligible to sign up again for the payment after the festive period if they again lost their job. Meeting outsideMs Canavan urged people to keep their contacts to a minimum. She said that when out socialising the advice is not to move between multiple venues. “Remember, you’re at risk even when you are in a controlled environment,” she said. Those planning to meet with vulnerable relatives over Christmas should also consider not meeting friends for a meal, but perhaps instead meeting outside. She said there is a direct correlation between the number of contacts people have and rate of virus progression. “That’s why we keep saying every contact counts. So just because you can move around and do more things doesn’t mean you have to. Socialising is discretionary, so use your discretion,” she said. “The end of the chain that might start in the restaurant among close friends or family, can end up with a family member or a friend in hospital – someone who’s been careful and has trusted those around them.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 over 70s set to be among first to be vaccinated","story":"The over-70s will be among the first groups to be given Covid-19 vaccinations, alongside long-term care residents and frontline healthcare workers, under plans to be considered by Cabinet on Tuesday.The Government will consider more than a dozen different population cohorts, determined by a range of criteria, including age, employment and vulnerability to underlying conditions.It is understood that the first priority group identified to receive the vaccine is those aged 65 and above who are resident in long-term care institutions, such as nursing homes.The second group will be frontline healthcare workers with direct patient contact, followed by the over-70s. The plan is to immunise this final category in phases beginning with those aged over 85, followed by those aged 80-84, then 75-79 year-olds, and finally those between 70-74.Government sources indicated a final decision has not been made on whether the three categories will overlap, or whether one group will be immunised before the process begins with the next group.The plan, which was drawn up by the Department of Health and the National Immunisation Advisory Council, and approved by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), will be brought to Cabinet by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly.Government sources said it will be a “living document”, subject to change depending on the efficacy of different vaccines for different cohorts, and the timing of their rollout.It comes as representative groups for frontline workers indicated their expectation that their members should be considered for priority access to the inoculation programme.Groups representing gardaí, members of the Defence Forces, teachers and transport workers said that while they accept the elderly and vulnerable should be first in line, their members should also be considered for priority access due to their role in the State’s response to the pandemic. The Irish Prison Service has requested priority access for the State’s 3,800 inmates.Daily figuresNo new deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported on Monday for the second day in a row. This leaves at 2,099 the total number of Covid-related deaths. Nphet reported 242 confirmed cases of the virus, bringing to 74,468 the total number of cases in the Republic.It comes as chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said it is “more likely than not” that Ireland will experience “challenging” levels of Covid-19 transmission in January due to increased socialisation over Christmas. It was less likely that the country will be able to avert significant levels of infections, he told the Nphet media briefing on Monday.Asked what Nphet’s alternative was to recurrent lockdowns, Dr Holohan said officials did not want to be in a position where the only recommendation they made to Government was for tight and challenging restrictions “but if we have to do it, we will”.Lobby groupsThe Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (Raco) and PDForra, the organisation representing rank-and-file Defence Forces personnel,\u0026nbspsaid their members who have been involved in swabbing should be considered at the same time as other frontline healthcare workers, as should personnel deploying overseas.The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors said it was not seeking preferential treatment, but its members are at the “front face” of policing the pandemic and it had raised the matter with Garda HQ. The Garda Representative Association said medical professionals would decide on priority groups but “we would expect to be a high priority among frontline workers”.The Irish Prison Service has requested the country’s prisoners be among the priority groups to receive a vaccine ahead of its distribution to the general population.In a letter to Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Monday, the National Bus and Rail Union also recognised that vulnerable cohorts and healthcare staff would be prioritised, but said those working in public transport “should be high on your Government’s prioritisation list for access to the vaccine”.The Irish National Teacher’s Organisation wrote to the Taoiseach last week, saying that while it “unequivocally recognises” that vulnerable people, the elderly and healthcare workers should be first, it is “imperative” that education staff are included among essential workers prioritised for a vaccine. The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland agreed on prioritising vulnerable groups, and said it would be guided by medical advice but believed “strong consideration” must be given to those working in schools.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4430214.1607374927!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister to seek extension of paid parental leave to five weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Children Roderic O’Gorman will receive Cabinet approval to draft the legislation.

The Minister will receive Cabinet approval to draft the legislation.The legislation is set to be introduced in January. The paid benefit is with the Department of Social Protection, which needs until April to update IT systems to reflect the change.Mr O’Gorman is understood to be examining whether the extended leave can be introduced, with people paid in arrears when the systems are changed.The Cabinet is also set to approve plans for a memorandum of understanding concerning the common travel area between the UK and Ireland, and how it interacts with healthcare arrangements. The plan, being brought by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, will ensure that people are still able to continue getting planned medical procedures within the common travel area after Brexit.The agenda is expected to be dominated by Brexit and plans to establish a sequence in which different cohorts of the population will be inoculated against Covid-19.The immunisation plan is set to outline more than a dozen categories for sequencing the rollout of the vaccine, which will relate to a variety of criteria, including age, profession and vulnerability to underlying conditions.Government sources said the list will be a “living document” and subject to change, depending on the properties and effectiveness of different vaccines, as well as the order in which they are rolled out.Communications strategyThe Cabinet is also set to discuss other aspects of the plan, including the communications strategy, which is seen as key to securing the high levels of vaccine uptake that public health chiefs say is important to ensure its effectiveness.Ministers will also discuss orders setting judicial remuneration and other matters related to public pay, being brought by Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath.Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris will bring forward plans to implement a commitment in the programme for government to review the Susi scheme under which grants for third-level students are assessed and administered.Minister for Media Catherine Martin will bring forward the final scheme of the online safety and media regulation bill, which will seek to create a regulatory framework to deal with the spread and amplification of harmful online content.The bill is also set to bring legislation up to date with the EU audiovisual media services directive.The draft scheme of the bill outlined online safety codes on how online video sharing services deal with harmful content, and will seek to establish an online safety commissioner.

Photograph: Collins PhotosFamily and friends of Trevor Deely gathered on Monday night near the spot he was last seen to renew an appeal for information on his disappearance.Mr Deely was last seen 20 years ago on December 8th, 2000 after he spent the evening in Dublin city centre with his Bank of Ireland colleagues following a Christmas party.Despite 20 years of Garda investigations and multiple false leads, his family still do not know what happened to the 22-year-old.Marking the two decades since his disappearance, Garda issued a fresh appeal for information, particularly for information on a man seen on CCTV walking behind Mr Deely before he went missing.“We’re entirely reliant on the public. We’re entirely reliant on that person or persons who knows what happened to Trevor and where he is. That’s all we’re interested in, where he is. It’s not even what happened. It’s where he is,” Trevor’s sister Michelle said on Monday.On Monday evening, Ms Deely gathered with friends and family of her brother on Haddington Road, near Baggot Street Bridge – the spot where Mr Deely was last seen on CCTV. Supporters stood in the rain, carrying posters appealing for information on his disappearance.The continuing investigation is being led by gardaí at Pearse Street station.“After spending the night socialising in Dublin city without incident 22-year-old Trevor Deely was last seen on CCTV passing the Bank of Ireland ATM on Haddington Road, at approximately 4.14am on the 8th December 2000,” Insp Katherina Joyce said.“Our investigation continues to focus on trying to establish the identity of a man dressed in dark  black clothing pictured in CCTV footage talking to Trevor at a gate on Wilton Terrace at the rear entrance to Trevor’s work place.“We believe the same man can later be seen walking a short distance behind Trevor in CCTV footage at the Bank of Ireland ATM on Haddington Road, he has never been identified.“This was the last known sighting of Trevor Deely and we believe the man pictured in this CCTV may have vital information that help us to solve this case. We would ask this man or anyone who can identify him to come forward.New missing posters have been put up around the Haddington Road area in the hope of stirring people’s memories of the night Mr Deely went missing.“He is the baby of our family and we have spent the last two decades doing all we can to find him. But we are still stuck in the same place of not knowing anything beyond his last confirmed sighting at the top of Haddington Road,” Michelle said.Three years ago a large-scale Garda search operation was launched in the Chapelizod area after a tip-off to gardaí. No human remains were found at the site. A handgun was located but it is not believed to be linked to the Deely case. The search was halted two months later.“It’s very difficult to me, the whole mystery surrounding his disappearance,” Trevor’s father Michael said. “You’re wondering about this and wondering about that. You just can never get away from it no matter if I drive down the country or walk out the town of Naas. It’s the same thing, there’s always something to remind you of Trevor.”A reward of €100,000 from Crimestoppers is still available to anyone who comes forward with information leading to the location of Mr Deely or significantly progressing the case.Anyone with any information can contact any Garda station, the confidential line on 1800 666111, or Crimecall on 1800 405060.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccination programme begins in northern ireland on tuesday morning","story":"The rollout of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, which was approved last week, begins on Tuesday morning in Northern Ireland with vaccinators first to get the jabs.The first immunisationns are scheduled to begin at 8am at the Royal Victoria Hospital in west Belfast. Vaccinations will begin at the same time in England, Scotland and Wales.Mobile units also are to be used so that care home residents will be among those being immunised in the first wave of the programme, health Minister Robin Swann said.In the first tranche, Northern Ireland has been allocated 25,000 vaccines which, with two jabs being required, will allow for 12,500 people to be vaccinated before Christmas.On Monday, Mr Swan’s department reported nine more Covid-19 deaths taking the Northern Ireland death toll to 1,059.The department also reported 397 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total since the outbreak of the pandemic in March to 55,444.With Northern Ireland about to quit its current extended two-week lockdown on Friday the latest figures show a drop in the Covid-19 death rate. There were 48 virus deaths in the past week compared with 63 deaths in the previous week.Hospital bed occupancy currently is at 99 per cent. There are 416 patients receiving Covid treatment in Northern Ireland hospitals with 29 in intensive care and 21 on ventilators.The Northern Ireland vaccination programme will take place at seven centres around the North, at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald in east Belfast, and at five leisure centres. The centres will operate 12 hours a day, seven days a week.A total of 980 vaccinators are first in line to receive the jabs. There are also 770 people who have volunteered to become vaccinators, and they are likely to be high up the queue.Mr Swann said care home residents also would be prioritised in the first phase of the programme.“It is well documented that the logistical requirements for the PfizerBioNTech vaccine pose particular challenges for care home deployment,” he said.“We have been working very hard on these issues, in consultation with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. I am pleased to be able to confirm that we are satisfied that deployment to care homes can now proceed in the coming days,” he added.“The solution involves mobile teams operating from the different Trust vaccination centres located across the province. I know confirmation of these plans will be very welcome news for care home residents, their families and staff. “We are currently considering how these arrangements might be extended to include over 80s in the community.”Mr Swann said the beginning of the vaccinations on Tuesday would be a “hugely important day and we can to look forward into next year with a degree of optimism”.“However, it needs to be stressed again and again that vaccination of the population is a massive undertaking that will take many months to complete,” he said.Meanwhile, the PSNI has reported that 923 penalty Covid-19 notices have been issued across Northern Ireland, with fines starting at £200. This includes 49 fines of £1,000 each for failing to self isolate. In November the minimum fine was increased from £60 to £200.Most fines were issued in Belfast (408), followed by 119 in the Derry and Strabane council area and 99 in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon council area.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4430169.1607371938!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu shifting from compromise to no deal preparations coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that many EU foreign ministers were becoming resigned to a no-deal scenario. Photograph: Oireachtas TVPA WireThe mood is starting to shift among EU leaders away from securing the compromises necessary to reach an agreement to preparing for a no-deal outcome, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney warned on Monday night, after another day of inconclusive Brexit talks.Mr Coveney also spoke about “a great deal of frustration on the EU side, not just within the EU negotiating team . . . but also across member states” and said that many EU foreign ministers were becoming resigned to a no-deal.He was speaking after a day of meetings at the EU foreign affairs council in Brussels, while negotiations continued between EU negotiators and British representatives. Mr Coveney also spoke to the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels.Mr Coveney said the negotiations needed a “political intervention from the very top” to break the deadlock, but if no agreement was reached by the time EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday for the December summit, EU leaders are likely to turn their attention to preparing for a no-deal on January 1st.Later on Monday night, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the British prime minister Boris Johnson announced that they would meet in Brussels in the coming days. Earlier on Monday Mr Barnier said that Wednesday had to be the final deadline for reaching agreement in the talks, though previous deadlines have all been breached.In Dublin, Government sources were gloomy about the lack of progress in recent days but said the meeting between Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen was a sign that the logjam could be broken. Officials also said the withdrawal of the British government of clauses in the Internal Market Bill – which threatened to unilaterally set aside previous agreements with the EU on Northern Ireland – was\u0026nbspa good sign.‘Incredibly downbeat’However, some senior officials in Dublin, who until now have expected that the British government would conclude a deal, are no longer convinced. One described the mood in Brussels as “incredibly downbeat”.Mr Coveney is due to update the Cabinet on Tuesday morning on the position with the talks, and on the preparations for Brexit, whether a deal is agreed or not.It is understood Ministers will be assured that the supply of Covid vaccines will be unaffected by a no-deal Brexit as preparations have been made to transport the vaccines directly to Ireland from the EU without passing through the UK. There are fears of significant delays in freight travelling via the UK landbridge.Meanwhile, the Oireachtas agriculture committee will on Tuesday hear there may not be time for the agri-food sector to adjust to a deal, even if one is struck.In hearings on Brexit on Tuesday, Dairy Industry Ireland has warned “that now there is insufficient time . . . to adjust to the outcomes of a prospective agreement, if indeed it is reached.”Meat Industry Ireland will say that “the failure of political negotiations has left our sector . . . in the unenviable position of not being able to plan for what is, at this extremely late stage, an uncertain future.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Ms O’Mahony was also told not to discuss internal issues in public.Speaking on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne radio show, Ms McDonald said “anybody can criticise Sinn Féin, I am often critical of the party myself. There is nobody trying to censor anybody.”“Somebody from Clare’s cumann called to her home. I know everyone in my cumann, they all know me. I wouldn’t think twice about knocking on a cumann member’s door. Obviously in this case exception was taken to somebody knocking on the door but I can’t allow you to create an entirely false perception that some anonymous unknown figure landed on anyone’s door.”Ms McDonald said she knows who the person is who called to Ms O’Mahony. “This person is a local person who is known to all of the members and was elected to the position that they hold.”When asked if it was the case that she had no issue with what happened, the Sinn Féin leader said: “I would have a huge issue with anybody going to anybody’s doors and instructing anybody that they can’t be critical. My understanding is that the knock to the door was to say obviously there is upset here, there is a problem here. There are internal mechanisms through which this can be addressed, that is all.”Ms O’Mahony had criticised Brian Stanley for a 2017 tweet about Leo Varadkar which appeared to refer to the Fine Gael leader’s sexuality.Mr Stanley, who initially defended the comment before deleting his social media accounts late last week, had tweeted: “yippee 4 d tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look 4 a pay rise the next morning.”Ms McDonald said that first she “could not fathom” why he had sent it but then she said it had to be viewed in context of it being sent on the day Mr Varadkar became Fine Gael party leader.Mr Stanley is currently taking a week off before making a personal statement to the Dáil next week.Ms McDonald said she had asked Mr Stanley to take a week’s break because she “was concerned for his welfare and wanted him to have some breathing space”.She said there was no equivalence between Mr Stanley’s first tweet and the controversy where Leo Varadkar leaked a document to a friend.In the first online message that caused controversy, the Laois-Offaly TD tweeted in reference to the Kilmichael Ambush in 1920 and the Narrow Water Massacre in Warrenpoint, Co Down in 1979, claiming they were “the 2 IRA operations that taught the elite of d British army and the establishment the cost of occupying Ireland. Pity for everyone they were such slow learners”.Ms McDonald said Mr Stanley had apologised for this but she said the actual problem was the “tone”.“Tone is everything. I think the reality is that recognition and recall of ambushes in the course of the War of Independence and beyond, these are matters that are marked and commented on, and yes the tone was the problem.”She said there isn’t a single shared view in Ireland about the country’s history.When Ms McDonald mentioned Tom Barry, the architect of the Kilmichael ambush during the War of Independence, presenter Claire Byrne said when he was asked to support IRA operations in 70s and hunger strikers in 80s, he refused to because he felt an organisation that planted bombs in public places was not one that he could support.Ms McDonald responded: “You’re right. As I understand it Tom Barry did have a problem with bombs in public places and the injury of civilians, he would not be alone in that.” When asked, and do you? she said: “Of course I do, of course, of course I do. Who would not? As a matter of fact I have a problem much more generally around the fact that anyone was hurt or injured and I’ve said many times before if I had written the book of Irish history it would look very different. But I didn’t.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178How the UK will get Pfizer\u0026#39s Covid vaccine from factory to patientThe hospitals that will have the Covid-19 vaccine, and how it will be rolled outThe priority list for the Pfizer vaccine - and how it will be rolled outWhat exactly is the Pfizer vaccine, who will get it, and is it safe?Covid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?What are the new tier system rules, and when will Covid restrictions end?When does a Brexit deal need to be done by?What no-deal Brexit means, how it might happen, and how it might affect daily life in the UKBrexit deal: what has been agreed, and what happens next?Brexit Day 2020: When is the UK due to leave the EU and how will it happen?New Zealand mosque shooting could only have been prevented \u0026#39by chance\u0026#39, inquiry findsLondon in Tier 2 lockdown - here\u0026#39s what the new rules mean for youWhite House \u0026#39opted not to buy millions of additional doses of Pfizer vaccine\u0026#39 Sky News presenter Kay Burley apologises for breaking Covid-19 rulesComment: Britain must expand its vaccine industry post-Brexit so we aren\u0026#39t reliant on fragile global supply chainSenior Tories hint at compromise on \u0026#39level playing field\u0026#39 to give Boris Johnson room for trade deal\u0026#39Melania Antoinette\u0026#39: First lady faces backlash after unveiling tennis pavilion at the White House\u0026#39V-Day\u0026#39: NHS chief hails \u0026#39turning point\u0026#39 as Covid vaccinations start in UKLabour frontbencher resigns after saying registrars have right to object to gay marriageBarefoot toddler among record 111 migrants to cross Channel in DecemberBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beyond smoke mirrors brexit deal remains likely","story":"Will this be the week when the shape of Brexit is finally settled? Yes, if the UK and the EU can agree their future relationship, to enter into force from the end of the “transition period” on January 1, in a way that is legally clean.Yet difficulties persist in three main areas: First of all, fisheries. Secondly, the EU’s demand for the UK to accept a level-playing-field, a regulatory \u0027straitjacket\u0027, in return for a degree of tariff-free market access. Thirdly, the question of how to police the terms of the deal - “governance”. On top of that, a deal is also needed on the implementation of the Northern Irish aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, which entered into force earlier this year.Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney has stated that he is more optimistic now about progress made by the so-called EU-UK Joint Committee here. This follows rumours that the UK would be prepared to drop elements of the UK Internal Market and Finance Bills, which the EU sees as violating the terms of the orce deal, if a free trade deal is concluded.As always with these kinds of high-stakes negotiations, everything is linked to everything else. When it comes to fisheries, there has reportedly been progress over the past week, but no deal yet, despite some briefings to that effect on Sunday. France has now accepted that the EU will suffer reduced access to British waters. There is also now more awareness in the British side that a no-deal would badly damage the fishing industry, particularly in Scotland, as the UK relies heavily on being able to sell its fish to EU customers.The EU is thought to be asking for 10 years of unfettered access to British waters while the UK is offering the EU 3 years of \u0027status quo\u0027 on access to certain fisheries. Even if both sides somehow met in the middle, concessions here will in any case be linked to concessions on the other sticking points.The level playing field sticking point very much relates to the heart of the changes Brexit will bring about: to what extent will the United Kingdom still need to take EU regulation into account in exchange for a degree of EU market access? In the EU’s ideal world, the United Kingdom would receive full market access, in return for taking over all of the EU’s relevant regulations, as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein do.Given that this is a no-go, the EU now aims to impose some kind of level playing field in return for a so far unknown degree of market access. Interestingly, Stefaan de Rynck, an adviser to Michel Barnier has stressed that there is a “huge difference” between \u0027no-deal\u0027 and a deal, especially for certain sectors like the car industry and agriculture. In my opinion, this means that UK-based manufacturing is likely to continue to enjoy a large degree of market access.For car manufacturers, but also the chemicals and aerospace industries, it is important that UK regulations covering products manufactured in the UK are recognised as “equivalent” by the EU, so these products can enter the EU, even if no tariffs were levied on them, something which seems likely, even with a degree of customs bureaucracy.Equally, for EU food or textile producers, it’s vital that the UK accepts EU standards of production, even given the absence of tariffs. Switzerland enjoys proper EU market access for manufacturing, but not for financial services, and this is in line with Switzerland taking over most EU rules for the former sector but not for the latter.A likely compromise between the EU and the UK could involve the EU agreeing to water down the scope of its “Level Playing Field”, meaning that the UK would accept a concessions, mainly on state aid, but not so much on environmental and social standards, which are typically quite uncompetitive in the EU.In return, the UK would probably give some way on the core Brexit question: “governance”. This concerns the degree to which the promises made by the UK can be legally enforced: through an arbiter, or not? With a means for the EU to punish the UK by restricting market access if it violates the terms agreed? Through a unilateral EU decision or not? Those questions are of prime importance for the EU, and to the extent there will be points of EU law to be interpreted –  the EU is legally required to demand that only its own top Court - the European Court of Justice – is able to settle those questions.In a nutshell, as long as the EU agrees to a watered down level-playing-field and the UK to a binding way to enforce this, a deal will be agreed. Given the high stakes, with Covid continuing to plague the economies on both sides of the Channel, one would expect both sides to make an extra effort to avoid the damaging effects of a \u0027no-deal\u0027 outcome. That this would not be a rosy prospect for Britain, which would suddenly risk tariffs on half of its trade, has been widely accepted, but also for EU member states, it would mean massive economic damage at a most unwelcome time.Germany would face a cost of 8.2 billion euros in annual exports, thousands of fishing jobs are at stake in the coastal member states and Ireland could potentially face even more damage than the UK itself, while it may even face extra checks on its exports to other EU countries, in the absence of a Northern Irish border.Perhaps even more troubling than all the economic damage is that diplomatic ties would be hurt, at a time when the EU is witnessing ever greater political tensions between East and West, North and South. With all that in mind, EU leaders and especially Prime Minister Boris Johnson are likely to prefer to push through and seal a deal.Pieter Cleppe is a Brussels-based research fellow of the Property Rights AllianceMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas bubble window should include travel days stop road","story":"The Christmas-bubble window should be extended to include \u0027travel days\u0027 to prevent chaos on the roads and railways, a campaign group has urged.The Campaign for Better Transport group has warned the current guidance, which says people have to do all their travelling within the five days from December 23 to 27, punishes those making longer journeys to see loved ones.The group called for the two extra travel days people travelling to Northern Ireland are allowed on December 22 and 28 to be extended to those also travelling long distances across Britain.The call comes as passenger groups have been warning the narrow Christmas bubble window could cause chaos as millions travel en masse to see family for the five days ion which three households are able to mix.December 27 has been highlighted as a particular potential bottleneck, as train passengers have one day to travel home due to there being no services on Christmas Day and hardly any on Boxing Day.There is also set to be further disruption on December 27 as traditional engineering works begin on Christmas Day that will see King\u0027s Cross station closed and services limited from Waterloo until the new year.Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport said: “People want to be able to see their friends and families at Christmas and we want them to be able to do so safely by public transport. “Currently, people will have to curtail their Christmas plans in order to get back before the window closes on December 27, especially those travelling long distances or on routes with engineering works. That’s why we need a wider travel window to allow people to make journeys safely and to avoid overcrowding on the public transport network. “Without adequate measures in place so that everyone who wants to travel by public transport can do so safely, we will see travel chaos and yet more cars on our already congested roads.”Last week, the Government announced a host of measures aimed at easing crowding and congestion on the transport network over Christmas, including additional train services and carriages on key days in the travel window.More than 770 miles of roadworks are being cleared to keep traffic moving, and the temporary speed limit where there are works on motorways is being raised from 50mph to 60mph.Ministers have also said they are in negotiations with the coach industry to make more services available over the Christmas period to take pressure off the rail network.Currently, Government guidance is that people can only travel outside the five-day bubble if they have ‘exceptional circumstances’.However, if they are travelling to Northern Ireland they are allowed to make their journeys on December 22 and 28, although they are not allowed to join their bubbles until December 23 and must have left them by December 27.Mr Tuohy said he welcomed the additional train services, but that he wanted the Northern Ireland travel days extended for longer journeys in the UK.He added: “Whilst we welcome the Government and rail industry\u0027s efforts to help people travel safely on public transport this Christmas, we are urging the Government to go further and adopt the Northern Ireland model of allowing travel one day either side of the Christmas-bubble window to help people making longer journeys. “Extra trains and extra carriages are very sensible, but people also need extra time to complete their journeys. A wider travel window would make it easier for more people to follow the guidelines this Christmas.”Meanwhile, analysis of train journey forecast data carried out for The  shows many people are planning to travel outside the Government’s recommended travel window.The data compiled by the company Zipabout, which advises the Government on overcrowding, showed in the four days leading up to the window trains will be five times busier than normal times.Likewise, the figures also showed rail services are likely to be more than twice as busy on the days immediately after December 27. The  has contacted the Government for comment. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"duke duchess cambridges edinburgh visit gets frosty reception","story":"Translated into common or garden English, her “advice” was as firm as could be without being rude.The rest added up to a warning to the Duke and Duchess that while nobody was going to stop them arriving in Edinburgh, they shouldn’t expect much of a welcome, never mind a red carpet or the familiar smell of new paint.However, the NHS key workers who met the couple felt differently.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ikea follows argos ditching catalogue 70 years","story":"Ikea has followed Argos by announcing it will ditch its catalogue after 70 years.The Swedish flat-pack retailer first published the catalogue in 1951 but will wave it goodbye next year as “times are changing”.

I think it is legitimate for them to say ‘No, it’s not OK to present that lecture’.“I do think that students should be exposed to controversial views. But the lecture I thought was not sound pedagogy and Eton was right to question it.”In another blow to Mr Knowland, the fashion tycoon and Old Etonian Johnnie Boden also withdrew his support. The 59-year-old founder of clothing retailer Boden had signed a petition which called for Mr Knowland’s reinstatement and accusing Eton of institutional bullying by firing him.Boden said at the time that he was extremely concerned about the incident adding: An institution I loved is losing its nerve.”But on Monday, he said that he too would like to retract his “unconditional support” for Mr Knowland, having now “watched the video and heard the arguments in more detail”.Boden said he has been assured that “lively debate of questionable views” are still very much encouraged at Eton but added “I can understand why the school cannot allow public posting of these views masquerading as facts. On Monday, a group of Old Etonians wrote to the school’s Head Master to say that Mr Knowland’s supporters have been “misleadingly” claiming that freedom of expression is at stake at the 580-year-old institution.“The reality is quite the opposite, as becomes apparent to those with common sense who watch Knowland’s lecture,” they said.“The school is defending the importance of substantiated debate in an educational setting that abides by professional and legal guidelines.”An internal panel, chaired by the school\u0027s vice-provost, will meet on Tuesday to consider Mr Knowland\u0027s appeal.If the panel upholds his dismissal, he said he is prepared to take the school to an employment tribunal and has so far crowdfunded close to £60,000 to cover potential legal costs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pubs encouraging drinkers purchase tickets live music nights","story":"Pubs are encouraging drinkers to purchase tickets for their live music nights, in order to exploit a loophole which means customers do not have to order a \u0027substantial meal\u0027 when buying alcohol.In Tier 2 areas, live music venues are allowed to operate at 50 per cent capacity and serve alcohol to ticket holders at the bar, without them having to order a main meal as well.Now, a number of venues across the country are taking to social media to drum up support, telling customers not to “nurse half a lager all night” as they look to kickstart their businesses after a punishing second lockdown.“We will be ticketing Friday, Saturday, Sunday live music events for £3,” said The Horns in Watford, which is listed as a pub on companies house.“This also means we CAN SERVE YOU ALCOHOL WITHOUT FOOD at any of our weekends gigs,” they added.“Tickets will be sold on the door on a first come first serve basis.”New regulations brought in last week mean that the “table meal” clause does not apply “where alcohol is being provided to a customer at a cinema, theatre, concert hall or sports ground.” The alcohol must be “ordered by, and served to, a customer who has a ticket for an exhibition of a film, a performance or an event of training or competition at the venue, to consume in the area where the audience is seated to watch the exhibition, performance or event.”This has been a lifeline for small pubs which double up as live music venues.In South London the Cavern Freehouse wrote in a social media post: “We will be selling Tickets to get in on the door on the night. Doors open at 5pm, Bands start at 8pm and bar closes at 10pm. No food is now required.  “I would suggest people get here early as it will get full very quickly as I\u0027m limited to 50 people. No bookings, it\u0027s a first come basis.  “If you are someone that nurses half a lager all night then I would please ask you not to come as I\u0027m trying to survive here and that place could be taken by someone that understands that!”Sue Hathaway, who works at the venue clarified: “The Cavern is classified as a grassroots music venue, not a pub.”The guidelines originally stated that alcohol could only be served as part of a ‘substantial’ meal, but the Music Venue Trust argued that 92 per cent of grassroots music venues do not have the necessary facilities to provide this. The revised decision to allow alcohol sales, therefore, identifies the purchase of a ticket as equivalent to the purchase of a meal.Mark Davyd, CEO of Music Venue Trust, said he had worked hard with the government to make the case that the consumption of culture and the consumption of food should be treated equally.He added that he was “delighted” with the outcome.In Tier 3 areas, however, all indoor entertainment venues must remain closed.Not all pub landlords are happy with the new rules.“I’m all for live music venues being supported, but if alcohol is being singled out as a root cause of infection, then it should be subject to the same restrictions everywhere, whether it is a pub, theatre, music venue or supermarket,” said Laura Trotten, who operates the Crown in Rutland.“Until now I could see some sense in serving food in order to try and mitigate against the effects of alcohol on people’s ability to adhere to the regulations, but this just doesn’t make sense,” she told the Morning Advertiser.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"want christmas return classic festive pop","story":"Elton or Mariah? East 17 or the Pogues? The Christmas song choice maketh the man. Forget King Wenceslas or the goings-on in Bethlehem, there is no faster route to festive feeling than late 20th-century Christmassy pop – something the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge clearly know, having enlisted Shakin’ Stevens to regale passengers at Euston on Sunday with his 1985 track. Snow-covered cheer aside, however, his performance of Merry Christmas Everyone exposed a hard truth: that Britain has been without a proper Number 1 festive cracker for more than a decade and a half.Arguably more culturally significant in 1994 than Tony Blair becoming Labour leader, Torvill and Dean winning the British ice dancing championship or the Nemesis opening at Alton Towers was the release of East 17’s Stay Another Day. The wintry ballad is best remembered for its music video, which features the four chaps in giant white parkas (plus questionable hatsgoatee configurations) gesticulating in a lightly agitated manner as snow falls.Forget that the band’s legacy now mostly centres around lead singer Brian Harvey running himself over in 2005 after eating too many baked potatoes the tinkle of those sleigh bells and doleful chord progressions still can, all these years later, make one come over all misty. It’s not an out-and-out tinsel-covered track, obviously – there’s nary a mention of the C-word – but it was the last time a song released at this time of year successfully inserted itself into the festive Number 1 oeuvre. “I Love Sausage Rolls” by LadBaby (yes, this is a real song) may have occupied the same slot in 2019 but in our hearts, and Christmas playlists? Not a chance.The one I wheel out each year remains reliably unchanged: it features the 12 purest pieces of holiday pop, of which Elton John’s Step into Christmas takes an obvious first place, with appearances from Wizzard and Slade, Mariah Carey, Band Aid, John Lennon and the Jackson 5. Plus (quasi-)honourable mentions for The Darkness and Leona Lewis, who released (non-Number 1 ranking) festive songs with all the sufficient cheese, jingle and cheer to make listening on loop as habitual as those endless dips inside the Quality Street tub.Depending on how many times in one day you can tolerate Noddy Holder asking whether you’re hanging up your stocking on the wall (loads) or Paul McCartney being quite smug about what a wonderful time he’s having (fewer), this year has curtailed – along with most things – the sort of charming December tradition of hearing these same songs every time you enter a shop, pub or cafe, and being unable to stop yourself from humming along.Festive pop is so small a pool, compared with the non-Christmassy kind, that being able to listen for decades to this same hour or so of variations on a limited theme (there’s really only so much to say about snowmen) without new contenders to displace them must count for something.The current UK top 10 chart tells the same story – of the three Christmas songs currently residing there the most modern is Mariah Carey’s 1994 All I Want for Christmas Is You (beaten to the top spot that year by \u2028East 17).I’m not sure what was in the festive song-making water 16 years ago, but if there was ever a time to inspire a new wave of enduring, sleigh-bell-laced chart-toppers, 2020 must be it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings joke proves cracker festive judges","story":"If you thought Dominic Cummings\u0027 explanation for driving to Barnard Castle was a joke, you are not alone.A competition to find the best topical Christmas cracker joke produced this winner.

There are plans for online sales to stop from April - although ministers faced calls to bring in both changes immediately.  Ministers are already looking at loot boxes in video games, which critics say can also lead to problem gambling for youngsters. Culture minister Nigel Huddleston said: “We’re committed to protecting young people from gambling related harm which is why we are raising the minimum age for the National Lottery.  “Patterns of play have changed since its inception, with a sht towards online games, and this change will help make sure the National Lottery, although already low-risk, is not a gateway to problem gambling.” As part of the wider review, also announced today, the Government will consider online stake limits, advertising and the powers of the Gambling Commission.

But fishing, while itaposs worth comparatively little to the UK, is politically impossible to ignore. Itaposs emblematic of the entire Brexit argument - Britannia ruling the waves as a sovereign nation, evil Johnny Foreigner nicking our fish and chips, and a load of old pollocks pretending to be something theyaposre not.Because while Johnson and his Hard Brexit weirdos bang on about piracy on the high seas, theyaposre forgetting the uncomfortable fact that the British fishing industry is not particularly British. Most of the British fishing fleet is controlled by just five firms - pescatarian barons who send supertrawlers out to scrape the seas of all that might be edible. The fuel their ships use is heavily subsidised by the EU.Government statistics show % of the deckhands are foreign nationals, who are cheaper and, as of January , will need to apply for visas to do the work theyaposre underpaid for, or  do it in France.They mostly fish for mackerel, which has the most profits, and itaposs mostly all sold to Europe. And less than three-quarters of it is from UK waters. The rest comes from - gasp - foreign seas.But % less mackerel is landed than in , even though the quotas have been set higher than science advises, because the drive for cash means fish stocks are disappearing.Oh, and at least one of these barons donated to the Vote Leave campaign. He must be VERY clever.Johnson is tying himself in knots over an industry with , fishermen, not all of whom are British. By comparison, the collapse of Arcadia about which the government is doing nothing involves , jobs, the failure of Debenhams risks , jobs, and the UK car industry which will collapse in a No Deal Brexit involves , workers, directly and indirectly. And , as threatened, Britain turns down an EU agreement for the sake of those fishermenaposs right to not bump into les Francaises dans le mer, those same fishermen will be facing big EU tarfs on the mackerel which they will be less able to sell abroad, but which will suddenly turn up, nice and cheap, on our supermarket shelves next to the chorinated chicken. And donapost assume, for a moment, that they can merelyto fishing for cod, and weaposll all get cheaper fish and chips. About % of the cod we consume comes from the waters around Norway and Iceland. Neither are EU members, but both are in the European Economic Area, and allow our fleet into their waters under its rules. After Brexit, they both want to fish in our waters too. So no sharing our waters, no chip supper.  To sum up - we fish in other waters, rely on foreigners to fish in our own waters, sell and buy fish with European nations, and in protecting fishing rights, are only protecting the rights of about five major corporations, some of which are foreign-owned.Itaposs the perfect emblem of Brexit, in that youaposre being lied to in order to convince you to support a thing which is ultimately more damaging than the thing youaposve already got.And thereaposs no need for the lies, because thereaposs a good pro-Brexit argument for fishing. These fleets burn huge amounts of oil that, after Brexit, will need to be subsidised in a world that wants to be greener. Post-Brexit, the government could tie fuel subsidies to cleaner vessels, better wages, higher safety standards.Quotas set by the EU have, according to campaigners, been far too high compared to the scientic advice on keeping the seas well-stocked. After we leave, we could set better quotas in our own waters, trading access to them with other nations infor healthier numbers of fish.And we could also use the laws of the sea as a blueprint for how we should deal with Europe after Brexit - co-operation, mutual interest, a better environment, and an understanding that,the fish get to keep their freedom of movement, perhaps humans could remember that borders are optional, too."},{"url":null,"title":"apprentice mechanic 19 bludgeoned 15","story":"NewsApprentice mechanic, , bludgeoned -year-old schoolboy to death in cold bloodMatthew Mason, , is alleged to have beaten Alex Rodda, , to death with a wrench after luring him into woods on the pretence of sexual activitymirrorShareByEleanor BarlowJoseph WilkesReporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAlex Rodda was allegedly murdered by Matthew Mason \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Matthew Mason, , is alleged to have beaten Alex Rodda, , with a wrench in woods in Ashley, Cheshire, on December  last year. Opening the trial at Chester Crown Court on Monday, Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, said the case for the prosecution was that Matthew Mason took Alexander Rodda to the woods on the pretence of sexual activity and then murdered him in cold blood. He said the defendant, then , and Alex had known each other for some months before his death and enjoyed an intimate sexual relationship.  Mr Unsworth  said Alex, a pupil at Holmes Chapel High School, was struck with at least  heavy blows in the brutal and merciless attack in a remote wooded area near Ashley, not far from Bowdon in Cheshire. He added: Alex did not stand a chance. His le ended in those woods. His partially clothed abandoned young body was discovered by a team of refuse collectors the next morning.  He added: The case for the prosecution is that Matthew Mason took Alexander Rodda to the woods on the pretense of sexual activity and then murdered him in cold blood. Alex had threatened to reveal their relationship after finding out Mason had been dating a girl for two years, the jurors were told. Mr Unsworth said in November last year Alex contacted Masonaposs girlfriend of two years, Caitlyn Lancashire, to tell her the defendant was messaging him in a flirty way and had sent him an explicit photo and video. Mason denied the allegations to his girlfriend, the court heard, but began making payments to Alexaposs bank account at the same time.  Alex told a friend Mason was paying him for sex andhe stopped the payments he would report him to the police, Mr Unsworth said. The jury heard his friend told Alex it was akin to blackmail and wrong. By November  Mason, who lived with his family on a farm near Knutsford, had paid £, to Alex over a three-week period, following the alleged threat by his victim to reveal their relationship, the court was told. Mr Unsworth said: The messages that have been recovered show that, over time, the defendant was complaining that the payments were cleaning him out.  The court heard telematics data from a tracker, used for insurance purposes, had been used by police to follow the movements of Masonaposs Renault Clio at the time of Alexaposs death. Telephone and social media data had also been analysed although Alexaposs phone had not been recovered, Mr Unsworth said. He said: We suggest that the defendant disposed of that telephone and he has decided not to tell anyone where it is or where it went to. The jurors heard that phone evidence would play a part in the prosecution case. They were told some background about Alex and were shown an image of him with a phone on a screen in court.  The prosecutor told them: He had a wide circle of friends from his locality, his school and from his work helping out in a local public house before his death.” The prosecutor said Mason, who had a girlfriend at the time, worked as an apprentice mechanic and he had a black Renault Clio which will assume importance during the trial. He said: “The evidence suggests that Alex and the defendant had known each other for some months prior to Alex’s death.” The prosecutor said on November  Alex messaged the defendant’s girlfriend of some two years and askedshe was going out with the defendant. On confirming that she was, Alex stated that the defendant was trying to message him, the court was told.  The morning he contacted the defendant’s girlfriend Mason added ‘Alexander Rodda’ as a new payee on his bank account, the jurors were told. He paid £ into the schoolboy’s account the next day, the first of a series of payments totalling £, by November , the court was told. Alex told someone he knew the defendant was paying him for sex, said the prosecutor. They told him it was wrong and that Alex told themthe payments stopped he would report Mason to police, the jurors were told.  The QC said the person felt that this was akin to blackmail and told Alex that this was wrong. Alex told the person on at least five occasions that he had had sex with Mason, said the QC. The defendant had messaged Alex via Instagram and a relationship which began with a kiss developed into sex, the court was told. The jurors were told about an incident when Alex’s mother arrived home to find the teenager flustered and a strange man, the defendant, inside her home.

Marc Antonio Dominguez Mappley, who worked in the horticulture science team, died at the attraction’s chemical storage area on July . An inquest into the -year-oldaposs death heard he suffered from a history of depression and had once before attempted to kill himself at the attraction several years prior. He was also struggling to deal with the death of his father when he died.The cause of Mr Mappley’s death was confirmed as hanging, Cornwall Live reports.Giving evidence during the hearing was Mr Mappley’s partner Jay Henwood, who described how they met on Match in . Ms Henwood said: “Marc had a great sense of humour and was a very, very funny guy. As time went on I learned he was a caring, loving person and an amazing father.” She claimed Mr Mappley told her he had previously attempted to kill himself, in the same place in  after his marriage ended, but wasn’t successful. But this was not reported to Eden HR or the police. Ms Henwood added “he found a new lease of le after as it scared him”. But in January Mr Mappley received the “shock” news that his father had died after a period of illness. He was said to have not properly addressed his grief. Worried about Covid and his finances, Mr Mappley and Ms Henwood moved in together in Tintagel with arrangements in place for him to see his children in Redruth. Ms Henwood described Mr Mappley as being “lacklustre and sleeping more” and making comments about being worthless and everyone being better off without him. In the months leading up to his death Mr Mappley was placed on furlough which created increased money worries and it was decided that he and Ms Henwood would together build her cleaning business. Mr Mappley’s position was also put under redundancy consultation although no final decision had been made. The couple had planned to marry as soon as possible but when Covid caused arrangements to be cancelled Mr Mappley was “hit hard”. Ms Henwood concluded by saying that although Mr Mappley had numerous worries, including planned alterations to when he could see his children, she was aware of no intention for him to take his le when he left for Eden that day. Mr Mappley’s ex-we and the mother of his children, Nancy, also gave evidence. She spoke of how they married in  but separated amicably when their marriage turned to a friendship. Ms Mappley said he had told her of his previous attempt to kill himself but he had promised never to do it again. She said: “He was a loving, kind and gentle person whereas Jay was fiery. He didn’t cope well with that. “His dad’s death hit him very hard as he had always been Marc’s rock.” On July , Mr Mappley sent his ex we a positive message saying he was “feeling strong” and three days later sent another one saying she is an amazing mum, they should be proud of their children and she would always have a place in his heart. She added: “He came to visit and told me he was being made redundant. His job was his identity and he loved it. He was clearly struggling but I didn’t think he was suicidal.” An Eden HR spokeswoman said Mr Mappley hadn’t actually been made redundant but the consultation was in process.

Dr Hari Shukla CBE, , spoke out amid concerns over take-up. Staff worked through the weekend to get supplies to  hospital hubs around the country, and GPs have been put on standby to start delivering the vaccine from next week. Dr Shukla, a prominent race relations campaigner from Newcastle, will be vaccinated alongside his we Ranjan, , at the city’s Royal Infirmary on Tuesday morning. The grandad said: “I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine, I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help.” The over-s and care home workers will get the first , doses, a week after the UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer jab. It cannot come soon enough as hospital bosses warned the NHS in England risks being overwhelmed in a third wave of infections after Christmas. The UK has secured  million doses of the Pfizer jab with around four million expected to be available this month. Those receiving a jab will be given an handwritten card with the vaccine name, date of immunisation and batch number. The cards will also act as a reminder for the second dose  days after the first. The first jab offers some level of protection around  days afterwards but the best protection comes a week after the second dose, officials have said. The Royal College of Nursing said identying patients likely to turn up for their second dose could be a “key challenge” in ensuring precious vaccine stocks are not wasted. The Pfizer jab was found % effective and reduced all cases of serious symptoms in clinical trials, with no signicant side effects. Doses must be stored at -C to keep them chemically stable and can only be moved four times before being used. Public Health England has  specialised Twin Guard ultra-low temperature freezers that can hold a total of five million doses, which are installed at hub hospitals. No date has yet been given for doeses to be brought to care home residents in England due to cold storage issues. Mass vaccination centres will be set up in sporting venues and conference centres when further supplies of vaccines become available in the new year. Defence Minister James Heappey confirmed Armed Forces personnel have been deployed to construct the centres.

Arrivals in Dover - including a baby without socks or shoes - reached land during near-freezing conditions after making the perilous journey across the English Channel. Among those who made the journey included a family of four. It comes despite a recent £ million agreement between the UK and France to double police patrols on French beaches. Several dozen people are believed to have successfully travelled to Britain on Monday. Meanwhile, Kent County Council announced it has begun accepting unaccompanied migrant children for the first time in four months. Five children were seen being brought into the Port of Dover aboard a single Border Force rib, along with a number of adults. They are believed to have been picked up in the Channel by Border Force cutter Vigilant after departing from France.  The youngsters, some too young to walk, were visibly suffering from the C temperatures at the Kent port and were wrapped in blankets and le jackets. Among them was a baby who did not have shoes or socks, being carried ashore in the arms of a woman. Despite continued vows by Home Secretary Priti Patel to make the route unviable, there have been unprecedented numbers crossing the Channel in small boats in .Last month, Ms Patel hailed a new agreement with her French counterpart aimed at curbing the number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats.

Recalling the day Gill, who had lung cancer, died in hospital, John, , says: “I made a pledge not to close our doors to animals that needed us. “Gill was pumped with morphine but suddenly sat upright... and then she just died in my arms.” The couple had helped ban the eating of dog and cat meat in Thailand and were a driving force behind the Soi Dog Foundation, tackling the problem of stray dogs and cats. After Gill, , died in , John and his team carried on their mission to neuter and care for stray animals. Now the couple have been awarded a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Award for their Outstanding Contribution to caring for man’s best friends.John says: “This award should not be for me, it’s for Gill and Soi Dog and our supporters. Gill’s the bravest person I’ve ever met. If anybody deserves this award she does.” John and Gill, both from Leeds, got married in Phuket in Thailand in  and fell in love with the island. John says: “I had a dog, Gill had three cats. We got another dog after we got together. We did a bit of voluntary work at the local Dogs Trust kennel. Gill was the love of my le. “We were opposites in a way, she was very outgoing, I’m not particularly. We complimented each other.” They went to Phuket regularly on holiday and eventually planned to retire there, but one thing always disturbed them when they visited. John says: “When we came here on holidays we talked about trying to do something about the horrendous problem that existed with stray dogs. “In those days there were an estimated , stray dogs, the conditions of them appalling. Most of them were skeletal and covered in mange, on every street corner you’d see stray dogs.” So when they moved to the Phuket they devoted themselves to helping thousands of street dogs and cats. John says: “We decided the only humane way we could do something about this was through large-scale sterilisation.”  They met a Dutch woman who had set up a charity called the Soi Dog Foundation and in  joined forces, deciding the best long-term solution to the dog and cat problem was a mass spay and neutering programme. Every day and night they would go out tranquillising stray dogs so they could be neutered and then recover at the shelter, now named after Gill. Hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats have been neutered since, including more than % of the stray dog population in Phuket. Crucially, Gill and John were involved in drafting legislation to make it illegal to eat dog and cat meat in Thailand. John says: “We have grown a lot. Thailand now has an animal welfare bill and the consumption of dogs and cats is now illegal. “We helped put an end to the dog meat business and the trade of dogs from Thailand to Vietnam, as well as the local consumption and skinning of dogs for fur.” In , while rescuing a dog from a flooded field, Gill contracted a rare form of septicaemia and lost both her legs.  John says: “She darted this dog and had to go into a flooded field to get it because it ran off. She dragged this dog out of the field so it wouldn’t drown. “The next day she did this big party in our house, she loved to cater for our friends, but that day she said she didn’t feel well and went to bed. “By the next morning she was in agony, I took her to hospital and her legs turned blue. I was told it was unlikely she would survive andshe did she’d lose her legs and arms.” Gill survived and did not lose her arms, and soon all she wanted to do was get home to John and her animals. John says: “Three days before Christmas she told the doctors she was determined to be home with the dogs and cats.She wanted to be with friends at Christmas, she’d always do a big Christmas dinner and cooked dinner for  people from a wheelchair. She wouldn’t have any help.”Gill battled back to health, continuing to work alongside John, and together they built a huge complex of shelters to help rescued dogs.

One customer said a hotel was a filthy hovel while another claimed it was by far the dirtiest hotel room I have ever stayed in. Consumer group Which  ranked Britannia Hotels as the worst chain in a survey of , guests as UV lights showed stained towels, broken glass and hair in toilets.With rooms costing an average of £ per night, making it one of the cheapest chains, guests gave Britannia just one star value for money. They were also previously the subject of a investigation by the consumer magazine into hotel hygiene during the first wave of the pandemic. When investigators visited the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkstone in the summer they found stray hairs and stained towels in the room they had booked. Further tests indicated that surfaces had not been thoroughly cleaned between stays despite the fact the hotel had advertised a system of enhanced cleaning.At the time, the chain apologised for the lapse in protocol and said in a statement it was totally committed to providing a safe environment for visitors but accept there is more to do. However the companyaposs apology could not satisfy consumer choice website Which . Rory Boland, editor of magazine Which  Travel, said: “It appears that not even a global pandemic could force Britannia to clean up its act. “At best, it’s drab and dated, and at worst it’s downright filthy – and after eight years at the bottom of our survey, our message is loud and clear: avoid these hotels. “While Premier Inn remains a firm favourite, it’s clear that this year, UK hotels have become more than just a place to lay your head, but a destination in themselves.  “With fewer of us travelling abroad this year, our survey shows that when it comes to holidaying at home, we’re quite happy to pay more for a little luxury.” Kent Live reporter John James John James checked into a room at the Grand Burstin to see whether the hotelaposs reputation was deserved. The hotel has struggled with poor reviews for years and holds only two and a half stars on TripAdvisor. It has more than , Terrible reviews, many of them alarmingly recent. One woman wrote of her stay: What a terrible shame such a hotel still exists.  Would never stay here again and it isn’t that it’s a bargain price, it’s that price because it’s so bad. Do yourself a favour and stay where. Another wrote: The building is run down, stinks of cigarettes and booze. The interior is disgusting and our bed had pubic hair all over quite visibly. And one man swore to go to great s to never visit again. He said: Personally, couldnapost wait to leave this place and wonapost ever be back there again as I would rather sleep on the street.  Kent Live reporter John James on his stay at the Grand Burstin With such a glittering reputation, I was beginning to wonder what Iaposd let myself in for. I arrived into the Grand Burstin at around pm as the day was winding down. My first impression of the great white building that loomed above me was one of resignation. It was filthy on the outside, covered in green and brown dirt from who knows what decade. Things werenapost to improve when I ventured inside. Naively, I had assumed the hotel would be relatively quiet, considering it was a weekday. No such luck, it was packed to the rafters and the check in queue stretched around the dated foyer. As I sweated at the back of the interminable line, I did a quick headcount to see who was wearing masks.  Not only were barely any customers wearing them, many staff also had gone without. Itaposs not a requirement by law to wear them in hotels but I was still surprised. Things got worse when I reached the till and was informed Iaposd have to pay £ for the luxury of leaving my car in their car park. The sheer front of it would make a bargain flight provider blush. It was a scrum for the lts and I saw multiple family units cramming themselves into them. Disheartened, I trudged up the stairs to the fth floor to see what a double room at the Grand Burstin looks like. The TV was on when I entered the room and the view out of the window wasnapost exactly inspiring. The bedroom suffered from the worn out aesthetic of the rest of the hotel but I suppose it would look a little oddit didnapost.  Of far greater concern was the meal that came with my £ room, a sloppy plate of steak pie that managed to be greasy and dry at the same time. I stirred the tepid dish for a few seconds and trudged into the bar for a socially distanced drink. Once the bingo came on, I knew it was time for bed. I awoke with the sun light streaming in through the curtains. Iaposd deliberately left them open so as to beat the breakfast buffet rush - not that I was particularly excited for the food on show. True to Grand Burstin form, the breakfast was disappointing and actually quite meagre.

The pillar was spotted on Compton Beach, on the west side of the island, over the weekend. Island resident Alexia Fishwick was left dumbstruck after the discovery, which she described as really quite magical. She said it was pure chance that she came across it. Iaposd read about the one in Utah and then Romania, so I knew the signicance. Many people took no notice of it, she added. She said people first thought she had photoshopped the images. Ami Blackburn, , went to investigate and take her own photos with her son and boyfriend after seeing pictures on social media but reading rumours they may have been photoshopped. Miss Blackburn, who is a healthcare assistant from Newport, Isle of Wight, said: I saw the comments about the possibility of photoshop so my partner, myself and my youngest went to check it out. I thought it was very bizarre when I first saw it and immediately researched the ones found in Utah, Calornia and Romania. We moved some of the sand from around the bottom and itaposs partly buried but we felt underneath and it was made of wood with mirrors stuck to the side. Iaposd love the idea of it being delivered by aliens but itaposs more than likely an unusual art project. But can  get any weirder   I donapost know how heavy it would be or how deep it was buried but you have to go down some steep wooden steps to get to that point so I imagine it wouldnapost have been a one man job. Lee Peckham, a lawyer living on the island who also spotted the structure on Sunday afternoon, said: I saw it and wondered what it was and thought it a rather strange thing to see on the beach! I wondered who put it there and why. A metal edice was first found planted in the ground in a remote part of Utah at the end of November.

Teah Vincent, , called the boy a liar and slammed stupid people who are judging her and spreading c*** about her after she was found not guilty of knowingly having sex with an underage boy. The mum-of-three, who wept uncontrollably when jurors cleared her, told the court she initiated sex with the boy at her home in Woolaston, Gloucestershire, but thought he was over . The boy and a -year-old friend were playing football nearby when Ms Vincent, who is more than twice their age, saw them and invited them in for a soft drink on October , , the jury was told. She took one of the boys to her upstairs bedroom, took off her clothes and pulled him onto her bed, Gloucester Crown Court heard. After a four-day trial, a jury of eight men and four women last Thursday found her not guilty of knowingly having sex with an underage boy. It took them just one hour to reach the verdict. Ms Vincent has since spoken to reporters about the incident and the trial, saying the last two years have been the hardest years of her le, she is not a bad mum and she has been unfairly targeted by online trolls.  In a post to her , Instagram followers, Ms Vincent wrote: Are you people actually that sad. People getting paid to spread c*** about me and Iaposm so bored now of hearing it.If it was the other way around it would be dferent. I wasnapost the one lying for a bloody start.

If only you knew the HALF of it about what happened that night and the information on the liar that accused me you wouldnapost be so judgemental. Would love to put a few points out there that would change alot of your thoughts but Iaposm gunna keep letting you sad, sad people keep making money out of story which isnapost even true and a story which half of it is bulls***. Ms Vincent also hit out at silly journalists and dull readers as she thanked her family and other supporters for sticking by her, and encouraged people to share her post. After she was found not guilty, Ms Vincent posted a Facebook photo showing her celebrating outside court.  She wrote that it had been the hardest two years of my le. Ms Vincent told the Sun previously that she feels embarrassed and she wants to move on with her le. She said: This has wrecked my le. It’s also wrecked any chance I would have had of a career.

Things looked so bad that owner Susannah Lovegrove, who pulled him from the fox’s jaws, was told it might be kinder to put him down. But after losing Ronnie’s brother Reggie and mate Cagney in the attack, Susannah was desperate to save him. She says: “I hatched him and his brother Reggie under a hen. “They grew up quite naughty ducks, chasing the other chickens and the dog. So we got them some wives. “I was totally devastated when Reggie and one of the girls were killed in the fox attack, so I was determined to save Ronnie in any way I could. “After the attack in June, I did think it’d be a case of having him put to sleep, which was heart-breaking. But we wanted to give him every chance.” Her determination saved Ronnie’s le. She says: “The vet agreed to give it a couple days to see what happened.  “Thankfully some feeling did come back in his legs and feet and so we agreed to give him pain relief and get him some physio.” Susannah, who lives with husband Giles and three children in Oxfordshire, built Ronnie a wheelchair to support and protect him while he learned to walk again. Now he is recovering well and even has his own yoga mat for his daily exercise routine. The three-year-old duck has won a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Special Recognition Award for his bravery.  Susannah says: “We do daily ­exercises on his yoga mat, he has daily swimming sessions in the bath, and he has massage on his feet and legs to help nerve repair. “I even built him his own set of wheels, it’s basically a sling on wheels, which you can push around. It simulates the treadmill, and also gives him support when he is eating, washing and preening himself. It also gives him social time with the other ducks without them trampling on him.” Before the attack, cheeky Ronnie used to chase the family dog Willow and stick his head through the cat flap to taunt her. But now that injured Ronnie sleeps indoors at night the pair have become firm friends, and even snuggle up together in the kitchen.  “Willow seems to have accepted Ronnie and is very good with him, allowing him to share her bed and she even lets him have a little beak nuzzle,” Susannah says. “I think she knows he can’t chase her any more, so she can relax!” Due to his complex needs, Susannah has had to take Ronnie with her on trips as far away as Cornwall and Bedfordshire.

I had a snake go under my couch recently which I couldnapost find afterwards. When I came home my daughter started shouting, I looked at the tree and the snake was standing up straight and wrapped around the tree. I phoned the Sydney wildle people to come and take it away, and stood watching the snake for  minutes. When one escapes and go somewhere you canapost get it out. She added: I never had to deal with anything like this in Birkenhead. Iaposm not sure how it got in here before escaping up the tree.  I asked a neighbour to come and help, but she took one look at it and ran away screaming.

If you are not sick of data by now, then the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app presents its daily data from experts at health science company ZOE and Kingaposs College London, in a handy new dashboard. It shows the prevalence rate - cases per , of the population - of coronavirus for every area in England as well as the rate among people aged  and above. In a glimmer of hope, it shows only five subregions which are in Tier  and where the case rate is rising. This includes the county of Suffolk in the East of England, and in the South East, the combined subregion of Reading, Wokingham, Bracknell Forest, Windsor and Maidenhead and West Berkshire has seen cases rise. Meanwhile, in the South West region, the apossubregionapos of Wiltshire and Swindon has also seen cases rise. And in the North West, the apossubregionapos of Warrington and Cheshire has also seen cases increase. If these places continue to see cases rise they could enter the dreaded Tier  next week when the tiers are set to be reviewed. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study report is presented to the Government each day. The latest report shows that the majority of England has seen cases per , of the population fall or remain the same. But it is bad news for the Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull subregion in the West Midlands region, as they sit in the toughest Tier  and are seeing cases rise - meaning they may be stuck there for a while yet. And in Yorkshire, in the Humber, cases have also increased in the Tier  area. Areas in Tier  which have seen cases increase Suffolk Reading Wokingham Bracknell Forest Windsor MaidenheadWest Berkshire WiltshireSwindon Warrington CheshireAreas in Tier  which have seen cases increase Warwickshire Coventry Solihull The HumberAreas which are seeing cases go downGreater Manchester Cumbria Liverpool city region Tees ValleyNorth East West Yorkshire York and North Yorkshire Derby and Derbyshire Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Lincolnshire Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Shropshire and Telford and Wreakin Worcestershire Herefordshire London Hertfordshire Norfolk Kent and Medway East and West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove Oxfordshire Devon Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch and PooleThe ZOE Covid Symptom Study UK Infection Survey figures are based on around one million weekly reporters and the proportion of newly symptomatic users who have positive swab tests. Leading the team is Professor Tim Spector, a Professor of Genetic Epidemiology of Kingaposs College London and Principal Investigator of the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app. He tweeted on Friday: We launched today on the ZOE app, a complex dashboard about the stats for English tiers based on the govt criteria on prevalence, trends and NHS capacity.  Prof Spector said his team would be simplying the format of the data - but it is currently available to all users who self-report on the app. The boffin said Englandaposs R rate of transmission is at around . across England. But it is above  in Wales. The capital London is now seeing more new cases than in the North, where new infections have remained stable. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study UK Infection Survey found that there are , daily new symptomatic cases of the virus in the UK on average over the two weeks up to November , excluding care homes.  This compares to , daily new symptomatic cases a week ago and more than , six weeks ago, the researchers said. The survey found that in Scotland, cases have fallen to the same levels of the end of September, but recently plateaued and there are still around , infectious iniduals. It found that in Wales, cases have fallen to around the same level as the end of the September but have started to rise again. Prof Spector said it was encouraging to see the falling rates, but warned against complacency. Itaposs encouraging to see rates are still falling across most of the UK, and weaposre now below , cases, less than half the peak of the second wave we saw in October.  However, while we are also seeing steady falls in admissions now, itaposs important that we arenapost complacent. Even though the UK will start the vaccine rollout next week, many of us wonapost be getting one for a few months, so keeping the numbers low and under control is really important for the NHS. Iaposm confident that Zoeaposs app data really is the most up-to-date picture we have, he said. The latest survey figures were based on data from , swab tests done between November  to . Boris Johnsonaposs toughened  Tiers lockdown system will be reviewed every two weeks. As it was implemented on December , this means Wednesday next week will be the date of the first review.  Decisions will be made based on the latest case rate data, how much capacity the NHS has and what advice and recommendations are made by local directors of public health. Any changes will come into effect on December , after a decision is made at a Cabinet committee. The plan is to have the tiers system brought back before Parliamen on January , by which time it will have been reviewed four times. Vaccine details emerging It comes as Downing Street today confirmed more details of who will be first in line to get the vaccine when the first doses are delivered tomorrow. Alongside the those already revealed to be in line for doses, No  has confirmed that people being discharged from hospital after treatment will also be eligible for the vaccine - so long as they meet one of the other criteria. The first priority groups for hospitals will be people over , those who work in care homes or on the front lines of the NHS.  Care home residents are also in the first batch of the priority list but roll-out to them has been delayed because the approval to break up doses of the vaccine for delivery to inidual homes was not confirmed until today. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The NHS set out over the weekend that we have , doses available. The first of the vaccine will go to people over  alongside care home workers and frontline NHS workers. They have also set out that a small number of NHS primary care networks will begin delivering the vaccine from next week, the week beginning the th. They also confirmed that hospitals will be inviting people who already have out patients appointmentsthey meet the criteria - as will people who are leaving the hospital after treatment. The others will join throughout December and the coming months, they added. Asked about when care homes will begin to recieve doses, they added: The process of delivering care home will begin shortly...I donapost have a date. Care homes are rightly at the top of the list so they will be prioritised. Downing Street dismissed the prospect of NHS vaccination cards becoming a form of “immunity passport” to allow people who have received the jab to enjoy extra freedoms. “We have been clear that there are no plans to introduce immunity passports,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesperson said. “The cards … are NHS reminder cards that prompt people to get the second dose that they need. “That’s a well-established practice in the NHS to offer people cards to remind them of their next appointment.” The Government said it expects “the majority” of vulnerable people will be vaccinated in January and February.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are currently travelling around the UK on a three-day tour to thank communities for their efforts during the pandemic. Under current Scottish regulations, it is illegal to travel between England and Scotland unless you have a reasonable excuse. Mrs Sturgeon took a snipe at Kate and William as she made clear the trip breached travel rules during a briefing today. Refusing to be drawn on the trip, she said: “The Scottish Government was advised about the intention to visit, and we made sure that the Royal Household were aware, as you would expect, of the restrictions in place in Scotland so that could inform both the decision and the planning of the visit. “Any more questions on that should be directed to the Royal household.” She was also asked whether the trip would help boost morale, but made no reference to this question in her response. There are exceptions to Scotlandaposs cross-border travel ban, including travel for work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, but only when this cannot be done from home. Prince William and Kate stopped in Edinburgh today as part of their Royal Train tour of Britain.

According to analysis of Public Health England data from the week to  November, Boston in Lincolnshire had the highest number of Covid- cases among the over-s, at about  per , people.It was the highest rate recorded for this age group, the analysis by the BBC showed.Medway in Kent had the second rate at  per ,, followed by Swale in Kent at  per ,. Lincoln had  per , people and Gravesham, in Kent, had  per ,. Kent was the county with the county with the highest infection rates in the over-s age group.  It comes as a top health official said most people over  in Britain will have to wait until next year to get the coronavirus vaccine.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the vast majority of people at the top of the priority list wonapost get a jab until January, February or March. Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said the distribution of the vaccine would be a marathon not a sprint. Vaccinations will be administered at dozens of hospital hubs from Tuesday - dubbed V-Day by Health Secretary Matt Hancock - with people aged  and older, care home workers and NHS workers who are at higher risk at the front of the queue.  The Government expects the majority of vulnerable people will be vaccinated in January and February. But the over s are low down on the list of ten groups most likely to get the le-saving jab first. Downing Street would not confirm whether they were expecting four million doses of the Pfizer vaccine to arrive by the end of the year. We obviously have  million doses on order but the scale of the delivery depends on the manufacturing process as we move forward through December, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said.  Around  million people are covered by the  priority categories set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. The first vaccinations will go to care home staff and residents, NHS frontline workers and people aged  and over - around six million people. Asked how many people will be vaccinated by the end of February, the spokesman said: The majority of the vaccination of the vulnerable will be in January or February. But the spokesman stressed that two further vaccines were still being assessed by regulators, which could boost the number of doses available.

The first jabs give us genuine hope we will finally beat a pandemic which has killed tens of thousands and devastated the economy. But there is also fear a Government that committed deadly errors will fail again. If that happens, Boris Johnson and his Conservative MPs will never be forgiven. NHS and public health experts must be in charge every step of the way or the work of brilliant scientists will be undermined. We can all play our part by continuing to obey restrictions and by being inoculated when we are invited to be, ignoring the  scaremongering of crackpot anti-vaxxers. V-Day is a day to celebrate and to keep our guard up. Deal us in, PM Crashing out of the European Union without a trade deal would be catastrophic for Britain and damaging to  neighbours, so an agreement is beneficial to all. Boris Johnson must not be precious, and Michel Barnier and Ursula von der Leyen must be prepared to compromise during last-ditch talks in Brussels this week. The stakes are too high for Johnson to cling to his pre-referendum plan. His lies and nostalgic images of sovereignty are threatening jobs and livelihoods.

Over the weekend the -year-old posted a video of a Christmas dinner from Bread Street Kitchen in London, alongside the caption: Christmas sorted....The video shows a plate with a turkey wellington, pigs in blankets, cabbage and chopped up sprouts. In the background is a smaller dish with roast potatoes, parsnips and carrots. A hand can be seen spooning gravy over the top of the food. Many people were quick to praise the meal, with one person going as far as to proclaim it the perfect Christmas dinner.This looks so good, replied someone . Another wrote: I wish I could grab that plate through my screen. Others branded it delicious and yummy. However some people werenapost very impressed with the dinner with many taking issue with the gravy as well as the lack of Yorkshire puddings.  A dferent user commented: No Yorkshire Pudding. No Caullower Cheese. No Stuffing. Gravy thinner than my Nan’s arm. Fetch me some proper gravy... Pan of p*** that, someone  said. A third responded: That gravy is far too thin!! Not good Ramsay!

The “AI hit” on Tehranaposs nuke mastermind Mohsen Fakhrizadeh took  bullets and happened as the camera focused on him, triggering the pick-up mounted rle soon after. Chilling further details of the “death by remote” operation – probably launched by Israelaposs feared Mossad intelligence agency- only emerged today. As the top man behind Iranaposs top secret nuclear programme the scientist was at the very top of Tel Avivaposs hit list, as many other Iranian nuclear boffins have been. It is now believed the machine gun, mounted on a pick-up truck  yards from where his car had stopped on the way home was equipped with a satellite controlled smart system. Tasnim, a semi-official agency, quoted Ali Fadavi, the deputy commander of Iranaposs Revolutionary Guards, as saying: No terrorists were present on the ground...Martyr Fakhrizadeh was driving when a weapon, using an advanced camera, zoomed in on him. The machine gun was placed on a pick-up truck and was controlled by a satellite. Soon after the November  killing the pick-up truck was blown up, again apparently by remote, as the killers destroyed evidence.  The owner of the vehicle had fled Iran weeks before, leaving the kill-team to plant it at a spot on the scientistaposs route to his home. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the killing, but in the past has acknowledged pursuing covert intelligence-gathering operations against Iranian nuclear projects.

The ice sheet – roughly the size of Devon – is being monitored as it creeps towards the British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic. Biologists sayit crashes into the island it will cause major environmental damage to the wildle haven, a breeding ground for more than a million animals. Dr Adam Fleming, of the British Antarctic Survey, said: “The next two to three weeks are going to be key in deciding whether the berg will hit South Georgia or narrowly miss it.” Iceberg Aa broke off from Antarctica in  and has since drted for more than , miles. It covers , sq miles and is about  miles long. An RAF aircraft photographed the iceberg as it drted through the South Atlantic. Photos reveal multiple cracks and fissures, and what appear to be tunnels under the waterline.The government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is “keeping a close eye” on the iceberg. But the concern is that it could ground on shallower waters around the island. Due to the huge volume of much colder, fresh water from the iceberg, micro algae and plankton would struggle to thrive, in turn affecting species such as krill, which rely on plankton for food, which would then impact penguins and seals.

I do wish we had made it more comfortable, though.”Attacking midfielder McGowan was at the heart of everything good about the Dark Blues in the opening half and topped the performance with a goal of the season contender.Having run with the ball from the middle of the park, McGowan fired in from  yards with his outside of the foot shot clipping the post on its way into the net.“McGowan was fantastic, all our chances were coming through him and his goal was fantastic,” said McPake.“It reminded me of a similar goal he scored against United with the outside of his boot – he seems to hit it better with that. It was a great finish and I’m delighted for him.“Credit to Arbroath as well because they changed their system to deal with Paul McGowan in the second half – usually teams do that to deal with Charlie Adam.“It looked like it might be a nightmare for us and sometimes it takes a special goal to win a game.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters unravelling our deep origins","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space, who cut into the box and picked out MacEwan, who was foiled from six yards by Lewis. The keeper couldn#t hold the shot, and the ball eventually fell to Gavin Forgrieve, who tapped home from four yards.Nine minutes from time Saints midfielder Bonar, a key member of Red Star#s  Premier Division Two title-winning side, passed to MacEwan, who beat the keeper with a deft chip from  yards.Match report and photographs: Derek Black"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Surely to goodness we should have a plan.#I am also quite annoyed that Fyne View has closed, because it cost a lot to get it up and running, so that is money down the drain.#The public want to have facilities in their area and we cannot have decisions made without proper focus on figures before us.#Fyne View was a Lochgilphead-based care facility for dementia sufferers which was revealed to have closed its doors in November.Caroline Cherry, head of adult services with the HSCP, responded: #I totally hear Ms Rhodick’s concerns. But the purpose of this paper is not to go over decisions that have been made, it is to look at the audit trail.#Ms Rhodick then said: #Councillor Gary Mulvaneyhas said that the decision has been taken and the report reiterates that.#But it didn’t matter how many times people pled with the board to listen and understand, especially in a smaller area like this.#The consultation was not a consultation. People were asked along for their views and officers turned and told the public what they were doing. They were putting the cart before the horse.#The community will be really angry as nobody is listening. The decision was made months ago with one public consultation. It should have been two or three to get proper feedback.#Officers said what was happening and it was an option that nobody knew about.#Everything has been massaged for the IJB’s benefit. They are not listening.#Councillor Mulvaney said in reply: #This paper is reiterating what we have already decided and we are reopening a debate we had a number of months ago.#We now have a board member going back through things to which officers are in no position to respond.#I know Ms Rhodick feels strongly about this issue but the decisions have been taken and you cannot make comments like those.#It is just not appropriate for a board member. I suggest we move on.#Ms Cherry’s report said it was produced with the aim of ensuring there is #clear oversight and assurance on decision-making# on Knapdale’s closure."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor december 4 2020","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

community council chairman Les Turnbull said: ldquoThere was a conversation about the small playparks and I said we were going to lose all the small play parks apart from one.

It was suggested that the closures should be halted until costs are produced.Community councillor Peter Maudsley said: ldquoI wouldrsquove thought that there shouldrsquove been a proper cost benefit analysis because in taking away equipment from play parks there is a considerable cost.ldquoThe actual ongoing maintenance of the play parks is probably quite small, so someone somewhere shouldrsquove done a cost benefit analysis, and I think we should see it. There should be a moratorium on the closures until they produce the cost benefit analysis because they might be very well wasting the ratepayersrsquo money.Ms Anderson said it was ldquopursued vigorously, adding: ldquoWe didnrsquot manage to get the decision overturned.It is hoped that a group in the town will come forward and take on the responsibility for the six play parks under threat.:The imaginative way two young brothers donated to a Borders foodbankMr Turnbull added: ldquoThere has been a lack of consultation and whatrsquos alarming is we, the community council, did do a consultation, we had over  responses which I think is quite signicant, and most people wanted to see these small play parks retained.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-nearly-300-cases-past-month","story":"NEARLY  cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the past month.Data published by the Scottish Government at pm todayshows the Borders has recorded  new cases in the last  hours, bringing the regional total since March to .On November , a total of  cases had been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic, meaning that, in the space of a month, the Borders has recorded  new cases.:Coronavirus: Borders school announces positive caseIn Scotland, the total number of cases since March now stands at ,.In the last  hours across Scotland, there have been  deaths where COVID-has been mentioned on the death certicate.In the Borders, the number of patients in hospital with the virus has increased since yesterdayfrom nine to ."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-mcdonalds-reveals-number-jobs-available","story":"McDONALDrsquoS has revealed the number of jobs that will be created once its new Borders site opens.As reported last week, a new restaurant and drive-thru will be coming to Hawickafter plans were approved by Scottish ministers.The fast food giant has now revealed that ldquoat least  new jobs will be created.:Galashiels loses crown as happiest place to live in ScotlandA McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore delighted that our plans for a new drive-thru restaurant in Hawick have been approved.ldquoWe look forward to opening our doors in the near future, bringing signicant investment to the local community and creating at least  new jobs.The Hawick site on Commercial Road, where the McDonaldrsquos is to be built, will also see a BM store added.There is currently one McDonaldrsquos store in the Borders, which opened in Galashiels in .You might also be interested in:Coronavirus: Borders recorded nearly  casesin the last monthTwo Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesCoronavirus: Borders school announces positive case"},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-knowepark-primary-school-announces-coronavirus-case","story":"AN ENTIRE class at a Borders school has been forced to self-isolate following a coronavirus case.On Sunday , parents of pupils in the P P composite class at Knowepark Primary School, Selkirk, were informed of a positive case at the school.The NHS Test and Protect team identied the whole class as being in close contact with the case, and all pupils were therefore required to self-isolate.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Councilsaid that three other schools in the Borders have also reported cases recently.:Two Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesHawick High School and Galashiels Academyhave each announced a single case, while Ayton Primary School has \"a small number of cases\", according to the spokesperson.The spokesperson said cases associated with Ayton Primary School have \"implications for a number of iniduals within the school\".\"Currently no [Ayton] pupils [are] required to self-isolate,\" the spokesperson added.Parents at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy were informed of cases on November , and parents of children at Ayton Primary School were told about cases on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scotrail-offers-students-50-per-cent-discount-get-home-christmas","story":"SCOTRAIL has announced that students travelling home over Christmas will benefit from a fty per cent discount on tickets from Scotlandrsquos Railway.A mass testing programme of students planning to head home over the festive period is currently under way, in a bid to limit risk of transmission and provide reassurance to those travelling home to their families and loved ones.And now students will only need to pay half price for travel, on any ScotRail service until December .The train operator, run by Dutch firm Abellio, hopes the move will help students worried about getting home to their families under the current coronavirus travel restrictions.Students will first need to record a negative Covid- test before travelling, which could make it dficult to book specic train services due to testing appointments and the time spent awaiting results.Herersquos a little Christmas cheer for all of Scotlandrsquos university students.

This really is it. Nothing .An alternative is to mix up a saltwater solution, soak a towel in it and leave the towel on the windscreen overnight.You might also want to leave the engine running while you de-ice your car, but this poses safety issues and may also be in breach of the Highway Code which states you must not leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road.Theres also the risk the vehicle could get stolenthe keys are left in the ignition.The AA says:Get up at least  minutes early to give you time to prepare the car.Donrsquot drive off like a tank-commander, with a tiny hole cleared in the windscreen.Clear all windows using a scraper and de-icer. Use a cigarette lighter to warm a key for a frozen lock.Plan routes to favour major roads which are more likely to have been cleared and gritted.Allow extra time for winter journeys but be prepared for the inevitability of being late for work due to unexpected delay.Can I be fined for not clearing my windows before driving away Short answer - yes.There isnt a law that says it is illegal to drive with snow on your car, however the Highway Code says that you must be able to see out of every window clearly during bad weather.If you fail to do so you could incur a fine, but more importantly could place your le, the lives of your passengers and the lives of those around you in danger.As for snow on the roof, while, again, there is no law stating it is illegal to drive with snow on your roof,it falls off onto your windscreen while driving or flies into the path of another car then you could be penalised for such offences as driving without due consideration or using a motor vehicle in a dangerous condition and again, not worth the risk.For more information visit the AAand RACwebsite.Please be careful when on the roads this week."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-records-seven-new-cases-24-hour-period","story":"THE Borders has recorded seven cases of coronavirus in the last  hours, taking the overall figure since March to ,.The Scottish Government published updated statistics at pm today .There are currently  people in hospital in the Borders after positive tests.

Gen Marshall also served as secretary of state.Like Gen Mattis, Gen Austin would need to obtain a congressional waiver to serve as defence secretary. Congress intended civilian control of the military when it created the position of secretary of defence in  and prohibited a recently retired military officer from holding the position.One of the people who confirmed the pick to The Associated Press said Gen Austinrsquos selection was about choosing the best possible person, but acknowledged pressure had built to name a candidate of colour and that Gen Austinrsquos stock had risen in recent days.Mr Biden has known Gen Austin at least since the generalrsquos years leading US and coalition troops in Iraq while Mr Biden was vice president. Gen Austin was commander in Baghdad of the Multinational Corps-Iraq in  when Barack Obama was elected president, and ed to lead US troops from  through .Gen Austin also served in  as the first black vice chief of staff of the army, the servicersquos No -ranking position. A year later he assumed command of US Central Command, where he fashioned and began implementing a US military strategy for rolling back the so-called Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.vw,vw,px, px\"President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for politicising the military during his single term in office Gen Austin retired from the army in , and thus would need a congressional waiver of the legal requirement that a former member of the military be out of unorm at least seven years before serving as secretary of defence. That waiver has been granted only twice mdash most recently in the case of Gen Mattis, the retired marines general who served as Donald Trumprsquos first Pentagon chief, but resigned in  in protest at the presidentrsquos policies.Loren DeJonge Schulman, who spent  years in senior staff positions at the Pentagon and the National Security Council, said she understood why Mr Biden would seek candidates with a deep understanding of the military. However, she worries that appointing a general to a political role could prolong some of the damage caused by Mr Trumprsquos politicisation of the military.ldquoBut retired generals are not one-for-one substitutes of civilian leaders, she said. ldquoGeneral officers bring dferent skills and dferent perspectives, and great generals do not universally make good appointees.Gen Austin has a reputation for strong leadership, integrity and a sharp intellect. He would not be a prototypical defence secretary, not just because of his -year military career but also because he has shied from the public eye.He earned the admiration of the Obama administration for his work in Iraq and at Central Command, although he disagreed with President Obamarsquos decision to pull out of Iraq entirely in December .vw,vw,px, px\"Civil rights leader, the Reverend Al Sharpton, has welcomed Lloyd Harrisrsquos reported appointment Gen Austin was involved in the Iraq War from start to finish.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

He decided to light his pipe but unfortunately he also lit his beard which caused quite a panic. However, Santa was none-the-worse and still delivers presents today.#The group#s charitable giving not only benefitted the Kintyre community but also a nine-year-old Nigerian girl called Cecilia Wanjurta, whose seven-year education and boarding at a special school for the deaf was sponsored by Kintyre Round Table.Before attending the special school, Cecilia, who suffered from severe bilateral nerve deafness, attended a pre-primary school.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

What started as a personal challenge for David Brown has motivated not only himself but many others to raise money for charity as they keep fit.Many members of the charities for which David has raised money in  have supported him by completing their own runs and walks, the latest being Tom Donnachy, who features on our back page.The fundraising efforts of the three young girls who completed a K walk last weekend also inspired two businesses # Deliciously Scottish Eggs and Jura Community Stores # to donate money to Children st.Finally, it is heartening to hear of the community coming together to help dog Rogan who suffers from cancer.No matter what le throws at us, we can be sure our community will support us."},{"url":null,"title":"letters december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Susan had been previously unaware of it and so decided to go find it with her husband.When they got there, the tide was helpfully out, revealing the pool. She took some photos and a film of it, but when she ed home and looked at the film, she felt sure she could see a ghostly image in the water of the pool.This led Susan to research images of Lady Helen Hall and she reckoned the image looked like her. Was it a ghostly apparition in the water or a trick of the light  Well, people can make their own mind up, but for me, Susanrsquos message made me curious to find this pool and learn more about Lady Hall, after which it is named.So we made it a family weekend trip of discovery, which usually take place within the boundaries of East Lothian even in the best of times so this was perfect. Bilsdean and nearby Dunglass are favourite places of mine, as you will knowyou read my column regularly. Despite the busy A passing through, the whole area has a fascinating history and the walk following the burn down Bilsdean Glen has an enchanting waterfall. Reaching this walk from the village is hazardous, however, as an unsafe crossing over the fast-flowing A is required, so much care is neededyou go this way.We didnrsquot have much time. The timetable of the tides was against us, as was the dying light of a winterrsquos afternoon. However, we managed to reach the beach with just enough light and time to have our adventure. Susan and David were waiting for us and we made our distanced greetings and they headed in front to seethe pool had been uncovered by the receding tide.This part of the coast is utterly fascinating. There is a lot of erosion here, and whenever I come I see new geological features and wonder about them. Irsquom no geologic expert, but Irsquom sure we spotted a chunk of ancient volcanic lava which seems to have solidied in mid flow a moment in Earthrsquos story from millions of years ago.It was from near here, of course, that the geologist James Hutton was taken in  by Sir James Hall, Lady Hallrsquos husband, on a boat ride to nearby Siccar Point, and the rest, as they say, is history.But it wasnrsquot to retell the story of already-well-known men from history that we made this trip. It was to discover a place associated with a woman who, despite her achievements and talents, was ignored by history, as most women have been until recently.It was indeed an adventure to find her pool, for we had to scramble over wet rocks to get there. Our young children took it in their stride and my youngest Lewis was looking out for evidence of dinosaurs. There are steps cut in the rocks nearby and so I suspect Lady Hall had a more convenient route to reach her pool, but we had no time to search for that.When we arrived at the pool, the tide was not fully out so it was still partly submerged, but enough was revealed of the cut rock to show the outline of Lady Hallrsquos Pool. I could just see what looked like the small steps cut by its side.Susan and David told me of the local tradition that she would come down to bathe in the sea water. Perhaps this was frowned upon, given it was the th century and she was a lady of high aristocratic status. But the story goes that her determination to regularly bathe in the sea led to the creation of this pool, which captures the sea as it goes out, making it a safer place to swim in this rocky coastline.I did not know of this pool before Susan contacted me, and I knew next to nothing about Lady Hall, she was just another aristocratic name. But now, as I stood on the edge of the pool which bears her name, I became intrigued as I listened to the story.I saw no ghostly image of Lady Hall in the water, yet I felt her presence in the twilight. The sun had already vanished from the sky and a beautul moon was rising above the sea. It was cold but calm a perfect moment for a ghostly introduction. While I had not seen Lady Hall with my eyes, I now felt we had been introduced by her story, thanks to Susan.We chatted on ourabout stories and the importance of enchantment and magic when growing up. Susan and her husband had given my family a winterrsquos afternoon of discovery and adventure. Two-hundred years separate Susan and Lady Helen Hall, but there was a connection between them. Two remarkable women from the area who shared a love of the landscape and the stories itrsquos steeped in.And now I must source the book Lady Hall ndash Lang-heidit Lady, written by another local woman, Sally Wilson.

Take time to remember your pets as well. Cats and dogs love to see the bright lights and decorations. Kittens are particularly adept at scaling Christmas trees and pulling down tinsel. Pups love to tear at wrapping, so beware of your presents.Please be aware that there are some everyday substances which are probably more likely to be around at this time of year that can be extremely toxic to your pet. Every year at Dunedin Vets, we treat many pets which have been inadvertently poisoned and see some very distressed owners who feel so upset that they were unaware of the hazardous substance.ChocolateMost owners are aware that chocolate is toxic to pets and chocolate poisoning in dogs is the most common poisoning we see. Dogs are more likely to be involved than cats, who are less likely to eat chocolate, as its flavour is less appealing to them. Be aware, though, of some gourmet chocolates with sea salt which are attractive to cats.Chocolate contains a powerful stimulant called theobromine. This is a similar substance to caffeine. Just as caffeine is a stimulant, causing your heart to race and beat strongly, theobromine causes this to a much greater degree.The first signs that your dog has chocolate poisoningare vomiting and diarrhoea. If this occurs, they will probably feel much better and recover and not go on to suffer the full effects of the theobromine. If the dog digests the chocolate then the more serious signs occur. These include hyperactivity, high temperature and blood pressure, a fast heart rate and heartbeat irregularities. Some of these signs can occur within a few minutes of your dog devouring the chocolate. The darker the chocolate, the greater the concentration of theobromine and therefore the more rapid the onset of serious signs. Remember that chocolate cake and chocolate sweets are harmful, too, not just bars of chocolate. If you know your pet has eaten chocolate, contact your vet immediately.Vine fruits Fresh grapes and their dried ieties are toxic to pets even in small quantities. During the festive period, think about all the places where these fruits can be found: in the Christmas cake, Christmas pudding, mincemeat pies and black bun. The cooking process does not reduce the chance of poisoning.These fruits can initially cause gastro-intestinal upsets such as vomiting and diarrhoea. However,the grapes are digested then a toxin enters the body which can cause kidney failure. This is likely to occur a few days after the initial ingestion of the food. Your pet is likely to be quiet and lethargic. They may be unwilling to eat. They may be drinking lots or not drinking at all.If you suspect your pet has eaten grapes or similar and is showing any of these signs then take them to your vet immediately. Your pet is likely to be given intravenous fluids and have a blood sample taken to check how their kidneys are working. It is likely that your pet will need to be hospitalised for a few days on fluids and given supportive treatment to help the kidneys. Regular blood samples will be taken to ensure the kidneyis improving.Holly, ivy and mistletoeHolly, ivy and mistletoe are often found in Christmas decorations and wreaths, and are all toxic to our pets.Holly ingestion can cause vomiting but,digested and the poisons absorbed into the body, nerve problems can occur. These can include loss of balance and wobbliness, tremors and even fits and seizures.The whole of the ivy plant is toxiceaten but the leaves and berries are particularly toxic.A species commonly poisoned by ivy is the rabbit. They seem especially attracted to its leaves. Initially, the rabbit may show signs of lethargy, diarrhoea and reluctance to eat. As the toxins are absorbed into the body, neurological problems such as twitching, collapse, fitting and paralysis can occur.Mistletoe berries are toxic. The juice of the berries is an irritant and can cause sores and ulcers in the mouth. If the berries are swallowed and the toxin absorbed, seizures and death can occur. Only a few berries are enough to be lethal for a puppy.If you see your pet eating any of these plants, remove any traces from the mouth. Try to make your pet drink, especially in the case of mistletoe. Take your pet to your vet as soon as possible. Your pet is likely to be admitted for intravenous fluids and medication to stop seizures,this stage has been reached.These plants are extremely toxic and, evenrelatively small quantities are eaten, they are iniably fatal.Onions, garlic, etcOnions and other members of the allium family can be toxic to your pets. The alliums contain the chemical disulphide, which damages the red blood cells in domestic animals. Toxicity can occur by ingesting a lot of onion at once or taking in a small quantity over a period of time. Two slices of onion eaten every week by a dog can result in toxicity after a few months. Dogs like cooked onions so be aware of thisyou have prepared caramelised onions or similar.The toxic chemical causes red blood cells to break up, resulting in anaemia and an inability to carry oxygen around the body.Signs that your pet may have onion poisoning include weakness, depression and lethargy. They may be panting and breathless. They may have pale gums and a weak pulse, or collapse.Please contact your vet immediatelyyou suspect your pet has eaten onions.Your vet will blood sample your pet to check the degree and extent of the anaemia and red blood cell damage. Your pet will be given intravenous fluids and may even require a blood transfusion.Most cases of onion poisoning recover but intensive veterinary care and treatment is required.Macadamia nutsNuts of any type are a potential choking hazard for small animals. Macadamia nuts are just the right size for causing blockages in cats. They are also toxic to both cats and dogs. Within a few hours of ingesting the nuts, lethargy, vomiting and an increase in body temperature can occur. This can progress as the nut toxin affects dferent organs of the body. There may be neurological signs, with weakness, wobbliness or tremors. There may be lameness and stf joints. Eventually, the animal may collapse.Again, contact your vetyou know your pet has ingested a macadamia nut. They will require supportive treatment and monitoring and hopefully will recover.In cats, where the nut has caused an obstruction, surgery may be required to remove the offending item from the intestines."},{"url":null,"title":"preston-lodge-high-school-supporting-need-christmas","story":"One of the appeals has seen the school organise its annual lsquoreverse Advent calendarrsquo.Typically, Advent calendars see people open one door a day in the countdown to Christmas Day and receive a treat, such as chocolate or a beauty item.However, Preston Lodgersquos reverse Advent calendar sees people give items rather than receive them.Pupils and their families are being encouraged to donate food items which will be given to East Lothian Sunday Fresh Chicken Dinner Boxes.The initiative was set up by Prestonpans resident Jane Russell last Christmas and delivers food boxes to people most in need across East Lothian.Each box contains meat, fresh vegetables, sauces, spices, sides, dessert and a recipe card, allowing struggling families to eat a fresh meal.In the process of becoming a charity, the initiative has been supported by some famous faces, including Prestonpansrsquo world champion boxer Josh Taylor, who took time out in May to help volunteers pack dinner kits.In April, he also helped Jane and the Easter Bunny deliver Easter eggs to local children.The school said it was ldquooverwhelmed with the support its reverse Advent calendar had received over the past couple of years.People are being asked to donate festive food items which will go towards the causersquos Christmas dinner boxes, allowing people to enjoy a three-course, fresh Christmas dinner.The cut-off point for referrals is Tuesday, with people asked to email christmasdinnerboxes@gmailFood items that can be delivered include shortbread, mince pies, turkey gravy granules, table crackers, small boxes of chocolate, boxes of biscuits, hot chocolate, squirty cream, Christmas cake, ham stock cubes, tinfoil and oatcakes.Meanwhile, Preston Lodgersquos other venture is supporting Womenrsquos Aid.The school is collecting items such as toiletries, sanitary products and toothbrushes which will all be donated to the Womenrsquos Aid East Lothian and Midlothian branch.In its weekly newsletter PLus, the school said: ldquoThey [Womenrsquos Aid] were very grateful for our donations last year.ldquoThe Christmas period is a time when domestic violence increases and many women have to flee their homes without basic provisions.Pupils should hand in all donations to the school office."},{"url":null,"title":"daily-coronavirus-figures-update-two-halves-prestonpans-different-ends-scale","story":"Recent data from Public Health Scotland has shown the number of positive cases of the virus in the county has once again decreased.Between November  and ,  positive cases were recorded in East Lothian, with the countyrsquos seven-day figure per , of the population being ..Nine new cases were recorded in East Lothian yesterday , as was one death on Saturday.From September  to , East Lothianrsquos seven-day positive rate was . and  cases of the virus had been recorded.

You sat around talking cobblers with someone from the NME or Mojo and that was the way you got them to understand a band, and that ends up with them getting the cover.\"I think its always done like that. Some will say, Lets go for lunch at the Ivy. That wasnt the way we did it. We had a load of cans in the fridge. Each to their own.\"Whatever the case, it has certainly worked. Some  years on from its first release, The World According to Sly  Lovechild, released in the summer of , and, as remixed by the late Andrew Weatherall, sounding very much of its time, Heavenly Recordings is still growing strong. These days its home to such Music favourites as Katy J Pearson, Baxter Dury and Working Mens Club.The secret of the labels success  \"I dont think its ever been afraid to take risks and follow an instinct,\" Turner suggests, \"eventhe instinct is completely outside what anyone would expect.\"It was ever thus. Heavenly was born at the height of acid house. Indeed, it might not even existit hadnt been for acid house. And yet, just to be contrary, one of labels first signings was a Welsh punk band. Yes, it was Barrett who gave us the Manic Street Preachers, releasing their first incendiary singles Motown Junk and You Love Us.In its early days, Heavenly was home to Saint Etienne and Flowered Up but also to a country band from Camden, The Rockingbirds. In the years that followed it signed future Paloma Faith and Sophie Ellis-Bextor collaborator Ed Harcourt and anthemic rock band Doves and The Magic Numbers. That leftfield thinking continues through to the present day. Heavenly is where you will find the likes of Stealing Sheep and Gwenno who sings in both Welsh and Cornish. In short, iety is in the labels DNA.What is a Heavenly band anyway  \"I think its people who know themselves,\" suggests Turner. \"If you think about a band like the Manics, early on they knew exactly who they were. And someone like Gwenno, now, she knows exactly who she is. She was someone who had a successful album in the Welsh language and at the point where she is going to record a second album, when there are a lot of eyes on her, she decides to do it in Cornish. You think thats crazy but as she says,she cant do it then, is she ever going to get the chance to do it again \"The Heavenly backstory goes like this. Jeff Barrett had been working for Alan McGees Creation label ndash his first job there was to tour-manage The Jesus and Mary Chain around Europe when the band were playing -minute sets much to the horror of promoters ndash when he discovered acid house and met Andrew Weatherall. Oh, and he was also sacked as Primal Screams press agent. And thenBarrett set up Heavenly Recordings.It was very much of the moment, Turner suggests. Acid House had created a new economy. People were going out every night of the week. \"Maybe they ended up becoming drug dealers, maybe they became promoters, maybe they became people who ran record labels. It just presented a whole new set of possibilities.\"There werent DJs before. There were people who put on She Sells Sanctuary at your local night club at  oclock at night. But there werent people whose name you knew, who you went to go and see and follow. Acid House created a new template and Heavenly was part of that. It ersied, but thats the spirit of Acid House as well. Its not staying put in one thing for too long.\"How much of the label is a reflection of Barrett  \"Completely. Its very much down to him, but within the label everyone is allowed to bring in mad ideas. And quite often the mad ideas are the things that you maybe talk about in the pub and then, a couple of pints in, you think: this is brilliant. And then its getting into the office the next day and running with those ideas. Thats the space he allowed to happen.\"Over the years, Heavenly Recordings has been home to guitar bands, singer-songwriters, dream pop, electronica and pretty much every other music genre. And for a label based in London there is a surprisingly large Scottish connection. Heavenly has put out records by Dot Allison, Jock Scott, The Nectarine No  and even Edwyn Collins.\"Theres always been a Scottish connection. It also has a really big Welsh contingent and recently a really big Australian contingent. Weirdly, the thing that has been lacking ndash apart from Flowered Up, The Rockingbirds and possibly Saint Etienne who are from just outside ndash is London-based bands.But, he adds, \"I dont think anybody is bothered that they missed out on the Libertines.\"There were other bands who got away, though, perhaps most notably The White Stripes, who the label failed to land because those up the chain couldnt see the appeal. \"You had people in EMI going, I cant see that thats ever going to sell silver. It doesnt f****** matter. The record is great. It doesnt matter what it sells.\"The thing that has helped the label over the last decade, Turner suggests, is the fact that it has been properly independent. \"When I was there it was always an affiliate of a major label. It started off with Sony, then it became BMG, and then it was EMI.\" As a result, he says, \"you are kind of hamstrung. If it was EMI and there was a Coldplay record coming your record had to get out of the way. Andthe Coldplay record goes back they then look to move something into that hole in the schedule, which is why the second Magic Numbers album was kind of rushed. And it didnt help it at all.\"Now, being completely independent, you dont need to worry about huge artists coming in and taking up the bandwidth, as it were. It also means they can be pretty nimble.\"So, when David Holmes turned up with a single recorded with Sinead OConnor with profits being donated to the Black Lives Matter movement earlier this year Heavenly was able to put it out quickly.For Turner, Barrett remains the labels secret weapon. He is why,  years on, Heavenly Recordings is still going strong.ldquoThe person who signed Flowered Up and Saint Etienne is still the person signing Gwenno and Sinead OrsquoConnor.

Available nowReal, non-fetishised bisexual characters can be few and far between in literature, but You Exist Too Much isnt just worth reading for its efforts in representation. Its a stunning debut from Zaina Arafat, following the le of its nameless narrator: a -something Palestinian-American writer struggling with her identity. The story jumps between her memories of visiting Palestine as a child and growing up in America, and her present day dealings with failed affairs and love addiction. At its core is a troubled relationship with her mother, who refuses to accept her for who she is. Its a devastating portrayal of what its like to feel as though you never fit in - both in terms of the narrators sexuality and racial identity. Arafat handles these weighty topics with real compassion.God  by Hassan Blasim, translated by Jonathan Wright, is published in paperback by Comma Press, priced pound. .What makes a refugee dferent from anyone   Are they transformed by shared experiences, or can they remain iniduals with their own inner lives and personal histories  In Blasims novel, Hassan Owl, an Iraqi living in Finland, sets out to collect refugees stories for his blog, God . The resulting patchwork sketches the dizzying extremes well, from harrowing loss and danger to everyday drudgery. However, Owls commentary on the stories and his own le sometimes lacks the same personality and nuance. Throughout, letters from an unidentied literary translator arrive, and the revelation of their authors identity at the novels climax is one of its most effective moments. While Owl complains that Arab publishers find his prose too vulgar, for English readers the sexual frankness and profanity may no longer shock. At best, they show him dealing with the same banal frustrations and urges as everyone .Non-fictionA Promised Land by Barack Obama is published in hardback by Viking Books, priced pound .

In the first of a two-volume series, the th President of the United States chronicles his first two and a half years in office with a knack for simplying even the most complex political processes, and decades-long conflicts. A Promised Land is never hard going, but - inevitably for a -page tome - some chapters are more compelling than others. Where the brilliantly written book really comes to le is when Obama lets down his guard and gives us a glimpse of the swearing, cigarette-smoking, martini-drinking man behind the myth, offering deliciously acerbic assessments of world leaders. Exasperation is a recurring theme as the idealistic Obama butts heads with adversaries at home and abroad - its reassuring to learn that even the most powerful man on the planet felt helpless at times, and a delight to discover what was really going on behind that seemingly unflappable exterior.Childrens book of the weekWhere Snow Angels Go by Maggie OFarrell, illustrated by Daniela Jaglenka Terrazzini, is published in hardback by Walker Books, priced pound..Where do snow angels go  According to this beautully illustrated book, the impressions left in the ground eventually melt and fade to become our s looking on from above.

A small group of us gatherin the delectable converted barn, whipping up chocolate silk pies with pear and caramel, cherry crumble blondies and the best carrot cake Ive ever tasted. Here are some of the things I learned on the way.... If your cake batter curdles - or any mixture splits when using fat, pop it over a bain-marieand whisk vigorously. If youre using a KitchenAid, warm the bowl with a blow torch, and then whisk. Do this quickly though - you dont want your mixture lurking over the hot water for too long.. When putting pastry in the fridge, flatten it into a disk, rather than balling it into a boulder, so you dont have to turn a big ball into a flat disk later.. If your pastry shrinks in the oven, it means youve overworked it. Start again!. Use a toothbrush to create pretty splashes when youre icing a cake.. Roast damsons in the oven and use them to make jam. The stones squeeze out easily after being roasted, and you can use the juice in your cake frosting .. Use a hot kne to slice your cakes up - this works especially well for fridge-cooled gooey brownies. Warm your kne up by dipping it in hot water.. To stop an icing-sugar dust cloud, mix the butter and icing sugar with the paddle by hand, pressing it down, before turning your mixer on.. Use egg yolk, a tiny splash of water and a pinch of salt for the perfect egg wash.. Use acrylic rods when rolling out pastry to ensure its the perfect thickness all the way through.. Always leave scone dough to rest - it takes  mins for the baking powder to get to work, to relax the gluten and give you soft, pillowy scones.. Weigh your liquid ingredients - jug measurements arent always right.. When you make pastry or dough, mix it in your mixer to start with, but bring it together by hand for a perfectly smooth consistency.. When making sweet pastry, use sugar not icing sugar. Icing sugar can make the pastry rubbery.. Use white sugar when making caramel, not golden, because its more refined, so there are fewer bits in it that might crystallise.. Use rice for blind baking, not baking beans - its cheaper!. When making carrot cake , grate your carrots into a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess water. Sprinkle a bit of sugar on the grated carrot to help absorb even more.. Use paperclips to secure your baking paper to the pans - this stops it blowing around in a fan oven.. If your pastry breaks when you roll it out, simply give it a very quick knead, then put plenty of flour down and roll it out again. Have a pastry brush on hand to dust off any excess flour.. Le is too short to make your own puff pastry. Use ready-rolled, so long as its all-butter.For more information on John Whaites Kitchen, or to book a cookery course, visit johnwhaiteskitchen."},{"url":null,"title":"five-things-stairways-heaven","story":"Whaligoe Steps, CaithnessIt was women who used to do most of the hard work of lugging creels up and down the clf-side zig-zag of between  and  steps to the Whaligoe Haven, Scotlandrsquos least accessible harbour.

I have been working with renewables groups ahead of Tuesday to ensure that we put the best possible case for financial support to ministers.ldquoSupport for wave and tidal energy generation is just good sense. It offers a chance to generate the kind of green growth and green jobs we need in the Northern Isles and across the UK, and to lead in global innovation as we approach the COP climate summit. Ministers need to understand thatwe do not take this opportunity then we should not be surprisedothers take it instead.The MP has been speaking with organisations working in marine renewables, including European Marine Energy Centre based in Orkney, RenewableUK and the Marine Energy Council.Neil Kermode, Managing Director at the European Marine Energy Centre, said: ldquo We all know we are going to need renewable energy to power the nation and those of us close to the shore know there is plenty of it in the sea.

Decisions taken by UK Ministers in the near future will determine the delivery of the UK marine energy industry over the next decade and beyond.\"The critical need is for revenue support which recognises that tidal stream and wave are at an earlier stage than more established technologies like wind and solar. It is common sense to make specic provision which allows them to move from technical feasibility, which is proven, to commercial implementation.\"Our industry will soon repay that confidence by bringing down costs and delivering jobs and economic benefits, as has happened with other renewable sectors.

From the northern isles’ perspective, we see it rather dferently. The pandemic has shown us what is possible for other people because so many people in my constituency are left bumping along on speeds that are less than  megabits per second.“I joined the st century just a couple of weeks ago, when I bought myself an iPhone , which has G capability. I speed tested it as I was coming up for the debate today. I got a speed test of  megabits per second download and  megabits per second upload. We have spoken for years about a digital ide, but that ide is now a chasm.“For Orkney and Shetland, the idea that internet speeds and access to the internet should be more than  times greater in SW than in KW,  and , and ZE,  and  illustrates the nature of the problem we face. It speaks eloquently about the failure. Simply leaving it to the private sector is what has produced the situation today.“My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross [Jamie Stone] asked “Who is responsible for this ” We have this constantly in Scotland: on the one hand, there is the provision made by the Scottish Government and, on the other, we have schemes funded by the UK Government. The dficulty is that neither of them gives us what we need.“This House legislated for a universal service in broadband. Constituents of mine get quotes from BT for that and they hear of £,, £, or £, for a broadband connection to get them to  megabits per second. If that is only available to people who have a spare £,, £, or £, lying around the house, it is hardly a universal service.“However, my constituents are also frustrated at the lack of certainty and community consultation we see from the R scheme of the Scottish Government. We still do not know what they are going to deliver and when we are going to get it. All the signs are that the problems that we have had—a service to be deployed in the isles that is designed in Edinburgh what people in Edinburgh think we can get and we need—are going to be there again. The most remote and the most economically fragile communities in my constituency still risk being left behind.“It should not be rocket science.

They save millions of lives worldwide.#A #rolling review# of the vaccine — used to complete the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency in the shortest time possible — was started in October.This is done as the packages of data become available from ongoing studies on a staggered basis.Data from the laboratory pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality controls, product sampling and testing of the final vaccine, and the conditions for its safe supply and distribution, has been under assessment.Independent laboratory testing will also continue to take place to ensure every batch of the vaccine meets safety and quality standards.The UK Government has ordered  million doses of the vaccine — enough to vaccinate  million people — with two jabs required for an inidual to become fully vaccinated.However, the vaccine has to be stored at - degrees celsius — meaning there are logistical complexities in rolling out the vaccine on a mass scale.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: #It#s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.#First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed this morning#s news, describing it as #the best news in a long time#.She tweeted that the Scottish Government was ready to start its vaccination programme as soon as doses arrive.Everyone in Scotland over the age of  will be offered a vaccination — some .million people.Frontline health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and all those aged  and over will be prioritised in the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February.Unpaid carers and personal assistants, and those delivering the vaccination programme, will also be prioritised before its wider rollout.The First Minister is due to begin her daily briefing at .pm where she is expected to announce further details.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality so quickly, including volunteers for the testing programme, deserve our profound gratitude. “However, attentions must now turn to the practicalities of distributing the vaccine to all corners of the country in what will surely be one of the largest public health exercises in history. It is vital that our islands are not left behind and that appropriate steps are taken to guarantee equal access to the vaccine.“The Pfizer vaccine requires freezer storage and that presents practical dficulties in our island and rural communities.  I was therefore pleased that the Health Secretary was able to give me a categoric assurance that freezer storage will indeed be available in the islands and that priority groups in Orkney will form part of the initial roll out.“Further details about how this process will work in practice, including how any subsequent vaccines might be incorporated in the programme, are obviously needed.

Congress intended civilian control of the military when it created the position of secretary of defence in  and prohibited a recently retired military officer from holding the position.One of the people who confirmed the pick to The Associated Press said Gen Austinrsquos selection was about choosing the best possible person, but acknowledged pressure had built to name a candidate of colour and that Gen Austinrsquos stock had risen in recent days.Mr Biden has known Gen Austin at least since the generalrsquos years leading US and coalition troops in Iraq while Mr Biden was vice president. Gen Austin was commander in Baghdad of the Multinational Corps-Iraq in  when Barack Obama was elected president, and ed to lead US troops from  through .Gen Austin also served in  as the first black vice chief of staff of the army, the servicersquos No -ranking position. A year later he assumed command of US Central Command, where he fashioned and began implementing a US military strategy for rolling back the so-called Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. vw,vw,px, px\"President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for politicising the military during his single term in office Gen Austin retired from the army in , and thus would need a congressional waiver of the legal requirement that a former member of the military be out of unorm at least seven years before serving as secretary of defence. That waiver has been granted only twice mdash most recently in the case of Gen Mattis, the retired marines general who served as Donald Trumprsquos first Pentagon chief, but resigned in  in protest at the presidentrsquos policies.Loren DeJonge Schulman, who spent  years in senior staff positions at the Pentagon and the National Security Council, said she understood why Mr Biden would seek candidates with a deep understanding of the military. However, she worries that appointing a general to a political role could prolong some of the damage caused by Mr Trumprsquos politicisation of the military.ldquoBut retired generals are not one-for-one substitutes of civilian leaders, she said. ldquoGeneral officers bring dferent skills and dferent perspectives, and great generals do not universally make good appointees.Gen Austin has a reputation for strong leadership, integrity and a sharp intellect. He would not be a prototypical defence secretary, not just because of his -year military career but also because he has shied from the public eye.He earned the admiration of the Obama administration for his work in Iraq and at Central Command, although he disagreed with President Obamarsquos decision to pull out of Iraq entirely in December . vw,vw,px, px\"Civil rights leader, the Reverend Al Sharpton, has welcomed Lloyd Harrisrsquos reported appointment Gen Austin was involved in the Iraq War from start to finish.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3513753.jpg--.jpg?1607082664000\n","title":"christmas trees switch on lights up ballyclug mews","story":"COVID- has failed to dim Christmas Tree plans at Ballclug Mews in Ballymena.Because of restrictions the Residents Group were unable to facilitate putting up a real tree.

The Department of Health is actively exploring all avenues to achieve this priority objective, within the conditions on distribution set by the regulating body MHRA.”The Health Minister added: “Vaccination will be a massive long-term logistical challenge. Our rate of progress will depend on available supplies that will be distributed as part of a UK-wide programme. Everyone will require two doses, with a number of weeks in between.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3517048.jpg--.jpg?1607350157000\n","title":"work plan for cullybackey level crossing","story":"Translink, alongside our contractor Babcock, will be carrying out essential maintenance and resurfacing work at Cullybackey North level crossing as part of a wider programme of service enhancements at level crossings across the network.This work is essential in order to maintain the safety, reliability and resilience of the crossing and the new surface will also help reduce noise from traffic as it passes across it.This work will take place overnight on Wednesday th December.

He still expects at least  of the school’s  pupils to be in the classroom before the Christmas break while those remaining at home will be contacted by their teachers every day next week.Mr Guthrie told BBC Radio Foyle on Monday: “The teachers will all be in school and we will have a vast number of our pupils in school also.“Teachers will be supporting pupils within the classroom and those at home via remote blended learning.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseStrong views: Ebrington PS principal Brian Guthrie FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueStrong views: Ebrington PS principal Brian GuthrieMr Guthrie added: “I personally think that this week would have been the perfect opportunity for all schools to have gone down the road of not closing early but providing a blended remote learning model for the week leading up to Christmas to help protect it for all families involved.“We have had a very, very positive reaction from parents who have thanked us for thinking of them and their families in the lead up to Christmas.”Mr Guthrie said the move means families will have the option to keep children off school during the last week of term to help protect family Christmas time, particularly for those with “at risk” or elderly relatives. “We just think it’s the right thing to do,” he added. Education Minister Peter Weir has consistently said that there are no plans to extend the Christmas holidays for schools.

I#ll wait my turn until called forward by the Health Service.Meanwhile, his party colleague and Heath Minister Robin Swann has urged everyone to remain ultra-vigilant to prevent the spread of the virus as non-essential retailers prepare to reopen on Friday following the two-week circuit-breaker.We still have a number of crucial days left of the current lockdown measures and we need to fully maximise the benefit from these, he said.The more we stay at home and minimise our contacts with each other, the more we can push down infection rates.That way, we can protect each other and help give the health service some vital breathing space.The Health Minister also issued a stark warning that he will not hesitate to immediately recommend a further tightening of restrictionsCovid- cases spike again and threaten to overwhelm the health service.His comments come after the Department of Health on Sunday confirmed a further  Covid- deaths in Northern Ireland.A further  people tested positive for the virus.A total of , people have tested positive for Covid- in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began.The figures follow a warning from a leading epidemiologist that the easing of Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland will lead to a wide circulation of the virus.Dr Gabriel Scally said coronavirus cases were still high and that the Executive#s decision to end the circuit-breaker was setting the scene for a very bad January and February.In the Republic there have been no deaths and  news cases.The vaccine will start to be rolled out in Northern Ireland this week, with a vaccination programme to start south of the border within weeks, according to Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly.But there is reportedly a problem with #vaccine hesitancy# as up to % of people have said in surveys they would be reluctant to get the potentially le-saving shot.US President-elect Joe Biden started the ball rolling in the US with his offer to get the vaccine in front of a live TV audience, and the political party leaders in the Republic are now following suit.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greenhaw care centre has been the subject of a court order following an RQIA inspection on September . That required the Trust to relocate all  residents. Greenhaw is a -bed privately owned care home located on Racecourse Road which specialises in providing care to those with dementia. By October , it emerged that  residents had relocated, however, due to a Covid- outbreak the remaining  residents moved to Ward  at Waterside Hospital. Staff from the care home transferred to look after this group of residents. googletag.cmd.push Western Trust Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen told Thursday’s Western Trust Board Meeting that throughout November ‘our own team in Waterside has played a fundamental role in overseeing standards of care in Ward ’. They mitigated ‘some early risks around the potential transmission of Covid’ to other parts of the hospital. Dr Kilgallen commended Ann Marie McIlmoyle who stepped in as a Ward Sister to manage Ward , and was supported by Infection Prevention and Control , estates and support services team. All  residents moved to a local care centre on December , she concluded. In March, health watchdog RQIA was made aware of a leak within Greenhaw’s plumbing system, affecting the hot water temperature and pressure to a number of bedrooms and sanitary accommodation in the home. googletag.cmd.push It was then discovered that the dangerous bacteria legionella was in the home, however, none of the residents had Legionnaires’ disease. The direction to temporarily move residents from the home came as a result of the ‘very major refurbishments’ required, according to an RQIA spokesperson. That includes the provision of sufficient handwashing facilities and reinstating water supplies to bedrooms which would make it very dficult to provide the necessary standard of care.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally, from Greenlough, died last week and many tributes have been paid to him since. Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Mary’s Limavady and Limavady High School have been selected as part of a UK-wide programme which was announced in October. Testing will initially be offered to all staff and students in Years ,  and  across both schools. Rapid lateral flow tests will be used for the scheme, similar to those used in the recent Liverpool pilot scheme. The tests were recently criticised in a study published in The British Medical Journal, which raised concerns that the tests missed over % of cases. googletag.cmd.push The study warned the tests may give a  sense of reassurance. However, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Track and Trace, said the lateral flow tests could identy many cases of infection in people without symptoms. She told BBC Radio s Today programme that the tests were helping to diagnose tests that would otherwise go undetected. What we are doing here is case detection. We are not saying people do not have the diseasetheir test is negative, she said. We are trying to say [to people who test positive] You do have the disease and now we want you to go and isolate for  days. That is a whole dferent game-changer. googletag.cmd.push We are also very clear that until we get a much lower prevalence of disease in this country that we shouldnt be changing our behaviours, she added. Health Minister Robin Swann thanked the two schools for their particpation in the scheme. Work is progressing with a iety of local partners and experts on New Testing Interventionsfor a range of settings including this schools’ initiative, he said. “The learning arising from the NTIswill help us to better understand how new technologies can be implemented and extended more widely across settings. It is important to be aware that these NTIs are still at an early stage of development, and consequently these new tests must be rolled out with careful planning and evaluation.     “I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Limavady High School and StMary’s for their participation, and I would particularly like to thank the team in the Public Health Agency who have developed and are leading this NTI and colleagues in the Education Authority who continue to be instrumental in driving this important work forward.” Education Minister Peter Weir said the tests would cause minimum disruption to lessons. I welcome this initiative where pupils and staff, without symptoms, will be tested on a voluntary basis andI want to thank both schools for taking part, he said. The test will be supervised by trained staff and I expect there to be minimal disruption to lessons. Keeping our schools safe during the pandemic remains my top priority and I will continue to support schools in the months ahead.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on. To think we are in with a possible play-off space in such a short space of time is incredible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Christmas.jpg","title":"Christmas cup finals  ","story":"NEWCASTLE League officials have put in place what they say is ldquoone final attempt to play last seasonrsquos Harry Clarke Cup and Bobby Dalzell Cup finals.The Harry Clarke Cup final between Celtic Bhoys and Ballynagross has been rescheduled for Ballyhornan on Tuesday, December , with a pm kick off.The Bobby Dalzell decider between Killough and Ballynahinch Olympic Town is to be played at the same venue the following day with a .pm kick off.Itrsquos the latest attempt by the Newcastle League to play the fixtures, which have been postponed on a number of occasions owing to the Covid- pandemic.The Bobby Dalzell final is traditionally played on Boxing Day, while the Harry Clarke final is usually held over the Easter period.League secretary Alan Craig said he hopes the finals can at last get go ahead.However, he warned that there will be no further reschedulingthe matches are unable to be played.He said: ldquoDiscussions have taken place with the clubs concerned and agreement has been reached that should we find ourselves in a further lockdown, or unable to play the finals on these dates due to further restrictions, then we are at a stage that the finals will not be rescheduled.ldquoWe as a league have tried our utmost to give the players an opportunity to be involved in a cup final, but there comes a time when we need to make a decision on the values of the cup.

The concerts are due to be broadcast on Sunday, December , and Tuesday, December .News of the concerts comes after festive lights were switched on in Downpatrick last weekend, with others due to be illuminated over the coming weeks at local towns and villages including Ballynahinch, Newcastle, Killyleagh, Saintfield, Crossgar, and Castlewellan.Both Downpatrick and Newcastle will have articial trees, with a cut tree erected in Ballynahinch with the local authority illuminating festive lights at up to  sustainable Christmas trees across the district as well as  so-called street trees.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said that Christmas  will be like no other.She said the local authority wants to acknowledge the impact that Covid- has had on so many peoplersquos lives and sharing a message of light and hope for better times ahead.ldquoWhile we couldnrsquot hold our traditional Christmas events and light switch-ons, we still wanted to come together as a district and I hope many will join us from their own homes to watch the upcoming light and hope concerts, she continued.ldquoI am delighted we have secured artists of such calibre and proud of the homegrown talent from Newry, Mourne and Down on display.Cllr Devlin said that as the Christmas lights are switched on across the district, she wants to acknowledge the particular dficulties faced by the retail sector this festive season.She added: ldquoFollowing the latest restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive, our lsquomake it local Christmas campaign will now be launched at the safe and appropriate time.ldquoThe message from council is always to shop local and shop safely and this will be emphasised during the campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Down(1).jpg","title":"Down have title in sight  ","story":"ldquoWErsquoVE been knocking on the door for years now, and it is really exciting that we may finally do it.Those are the words of Down captain Karen McMullan ahead of Saturdayrsquos clash with Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Breffni Park, Cavan.Down were beaten finalists two years ago, before making the semi-finals last year. Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

I also hope that in the final few weeks before Christmas people will support our local business community but remember to shop safety and adhere to social distancing measures.Meanwhile, anyone wishing to speak with a council official about a membership package or who has other queries is asked to telephone   .The council has confirmed that will also continue to provide latest information and updates via the NMD Be Active App, NMD Be Active Facebook page and its website https:www.newrymournedown.org leisure-facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister urged to commit funding to begin bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to commit the money required to build Ballynahinchrsquos new multi-million pound bypass.The appeal was made at special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council on Monday evening when roads officials tabled their annual report detailing planned investment across the district during the current financial year.The meeting took place just weeks after it emerged that a start date for the near two-mile bypass could be revealed early in the New Year.Mrs Mallon has confirmed that she will make a so-called direction order within weeks which is expected to outline when contractors could be on site.Major progress has been made over recent years to advance the scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads with the bypass designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district with suggestions that it will take at least  months to construct, with roads officials insisting that the scheme will reduce journey times and improve road safety.Last June, the roads minister included the bypass in a list of strategic projects expected to progress during the current financial year, with the local scheme mdash which could cost up to poundm mdash effectively ready to proceed.At the time, roads officials said the bypass was now at an ldquoadvanced stage of development and that preparatory work on contract documentation had been completed.Officials said the roads minister had asked them to complete the work necessary to allow her to make the so-called direction order which included reviewing environmental reports which is nearing completion.The government department said that subject to the outcome of the review, the minister hopes to be in position to make the direction order for the Ballynahinch bypass in the New Year and was committed to moving ahead with the scheme.On Monday evening, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker said while progress on the eagerly-awaited scheme is welcome, what people want to see is money committed to allow contractors to begin work.ldquoConfirmation that the roads minister is preparing to make a direction order is good news. Progress is at last being made, but the money required to finance the scheme is the final piece in the development jigsaw, he said.ldquoThis scheme is good news for the people of Ballynahinch and the wider district and what everyone is keen to see is a timetable for delivery.Cllr Walker said the bypass had been talked about for  years and was now literally within touching distance.He added: ldquoWhat we require is a definitive timetable and confirmation from the roads minister that the money to build the new road is there. The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested. The situation they fund themselves in is not fair, he added.The Department for Infrastructurersquos network manager, James Kelly, said while a previous roads manager was minded to proceed with the Ballynahinch scheme, it did not reach the point of going ahead.He said there was now an opportunity for roads officials to refresh the schemersquos environmental assessments before presenting them to the minister again.Mr Kelly said with the scheme expected to cost between poundm and poundm,Mrs Mallon wishes for it to proceed, the bypass will have to enter a process where it will be competing for finance with other schemes.He added: ldquoWe cannot guarantee that the money will be available next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 New.jpg","title":"New bus at Knockevin Special School following £28k donation  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special School in Downpatrick has taken charge of a new bus thanks to the generosity of the Lordrsquos Taverners and the schoolrsquos parent staff association.The PSA donated pound, towards the cost of the new wheelchair accessible bus which was provided by the Lordrsquos Taverners, which provides support for people with disabilities.The bus was recently handed over to the school by PSA members, who will also fund its running costs.The PSA was formed in  when parents and staff came together to fund music therapy for the pupils which was no longer being funded by the relevant authorities.The associationrsquos goal is to support all of the pupils at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and Knockevin Early Years Centre in Dundrum.PSA chairperson Kelley OrsquoReilly said: ldquoSince we formed we have raised considerable amounts of money through ious events and projects, such as the Sparkle Project in , with our previous chairperson Paula Dillon at the helm, which saw the local community come together to raise money for the refurbishment of two sensory rooms and the hydrotherapy pool.ldquoWe smashed our target of pound, to raise a staggering amount of over pound, and we were able to provide the school with a bicycle track and new bikes.ldquoWe funded a Memory Tree, which the school had wanted for some considerable time, designed and constructed by local artist Kevin Killen, to remember pupils who passed away while attending Knockevin.Kelley added: ldquoWe also have recently agreed to fund the refurbishment of the soft play area in the Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities unit within the Downpatrick school site. Our next aim is to provide funding for outdoor gym play equipment which is essential at this time.Due to the Covid pandemic the PSA was forced to cancel or postpone many fundraising events such as the annual  and k runs and family fun walk.The bag pack at the Asda supermarket Downpatrick also had to be cancelled, although the PSA received a generous donation from Asda for its Christmas raffle.The tenth anniversary ball, which was to have been held in the Burrendale Hotel, has been put back until October .A drive-in movie screening of the Christmas film Elf at Letrsquos Go Hydro in Carryduff this Sunday has also been cancelled, but there are hopes that it can be rescheduled for a later date.Said Kelley: ldquoWe are always so grateful of all the support we receive not only from our parents, carers and school staff, who all volunteer their time to organise and carry out events, but also the local community.ldquoWithout everyonersquos help we would not be able to continue to support our amazing children and young adults, which is our purpose.She added: ldquoBoth school sites are held in such high regard by the local community and by parents and carers.ldquoWe look forward to a time when we can resume fundraising as a community again.

There is a programme within that which will go out to the public and I would imagine multiple groups will want to apply from all over the district.“I would hope and expect the group Cllr Cuthbertson refers to will also be an applicant, that is how we do our business.“My role in all of this is to ensure we are consistent in our approach, trouble arises when criteria is applied inconsistently.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said “it was a bit rich” of Cllr Cuthbertson to make this accusation.“Essentially what has been put here isCouncil does not jump to the beck and call of a certain community group it is in the wrong,” said Cllr McPeake.“I think that would be a very dangerous precedent to start going down.“We are at a very early stage in this and are going down the route of best practice, taking an educational view and taking all perspectives into account.“That is the way it should be and the way it was previously.“I just think it is a bit rich but I am not surprised coming from the same councillor.“It is absolutely hypocriticalfor a member to be castigating this council because somehow, the Council is not acting to the whim of a certain community group.”In response, Cllr Cuthbertson said he would “not take any lectures about being hypocriticalfrom a Sinn Fein member” and reiterated his stance that it is not for an officer to decide what community feedback is included in a report.“Are we saying now that ratepayers in Mid Ulster have no say in any policy coming forward. Does community feedbackmean nothing,” asked Cllr Cuthbertson.“Is it now the case any consultation this Council does is simply a paper ticking exercise as community feedback means nothing ”The Council’s Chair described this suggestion as “rubbish” and “not the experience of any other member in this council.”Maghera author signs up top scriptwriter - read hereEditor’s messageThank you for reading this article.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many learning support assistants are unable to socially distance from pupils because of the nature of their roles, which includes one-to-one support at proximity as well as personal care.ldquoThis group of workers have already made huge sacrices during the pandemic. The autumn half-term holiday formed part of the all-Wales firebreak, which restricted school support staff from being able to fully enjoy a break.The Welsh Government has since confirmed that the priority is to keep children in school until the end of term on December .Local authorities, however, have been making their own decisions on what their schools will do for the few weeks of term with some opting for blended learning, while others will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Gen Marshall also served as secretary of state.Like Gen Mattis, Gen Austin would need to obtain a congressional waiver to serve as defence secretary. Congress intended civilian control of the military when it created the position of secretary of defence in  and prohibited a recently retired military officer from holding the position.One of the people who confirmed the pick to The Associated Press said Gen Austinrsquos selection was about choosing the best possible person, but acknowledged pressure had built to name a candidate of colour and that Gen Austinrsquos stock had risen in recent days.Mr Biden has known Gen Austin at least since the generalrsquos years leading US and coalition troops in Iraq while Mr Biden was vice president. Gen Austin was commander in Baghdad of the Multinational Corps-Iraq in  when Barack Obama was elected president, and ed to lead US troops from  through .Gen Austin also served in  as the first black vice chief of staff of the army, the servicersquos No -ranking position. A year later he assumed command of US Central Command, where he fashioned and began implementing a US military strategy for rolling back the so-called Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. vw,vw,px, px\"President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for politicising the military during his single term in office Gen Austin retired from the army in , and thus would need a congressional waiver of the legal requirement that a former member of the military be out of unorm at least seven years before serving as secretary of defence. That waiver has been granted only twice mdash most recently in the case of Gen Mattis, the retired marines general who served as Donald Trumprsquos first Pentagon chief, but resigned in  in protest at the presidentrsquos policies.Loren DeJonge Schulman, who spent  years in senior staff positions at the Pentagon and the National Security Council, said she understood why Mr Biden would seek candidates with a deep understanding of the military. However, she worries that appointing a general to a political role could prolong some of the damage caused by Mr Trumprsquos politicisation of the military.ldquoBut retired generals are not one-for-one substitutes of civilian leaders, she said. ldquoGeneral officers bring dferent skills and dferent perspectives, and great generals do not universally make good appointees.Gen Austin has a reputation for strong leadership, integrity and a sharp intellect. He would not be a prototypical defence secretary, not just because of his -year military career but also because he has shied from the public eye.He earned the admiration of the Obama administration for his work in Iraq and at Central Command, although he disagreed with President Obamarsquos decision to pull out of Iraq entirely in December . vw,vw,px, px\"Civil rights leader, the Reverend Al Sharpton, has welcomed Lloyd Harrisrsquos reported appointment Gen Austin was involved in the Iraq War from start to finish.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLondon and Brussels have found control of the seas a perennial sticking point in trade negotiations, with supporters of Leave saying Brexit should mean Britain getting its country, and its fish, back.The British position is that, as an independent coastal state, the UK should be able to prioritise its own boats.However, the UK exported  thousand tonnes of fish to members of the EU in  with a value of pound. billion, according to figures from the Marine Management Organisation , and continued access to the markets is key for the industry.ndash What is the history of the issue The UK Governmentrsquos allowing of other countries to fish in its waters predates its entry into the European Union.The London Fisheries Convention, signed in , allowed vessels from France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands to fish inside the UKrsquos  nautical mile territorial zone up to six miles from the coast, and for British fleets to fish to the same distance off the coastlines of other signatories.Britain withdrew from the convention in , which was largely superseded by the EUrsquos Common Fisheries Policywhich the UK will also leave on December  at the end of the Brexit transition period.ndash What is the situation now Act now to keep your fisheries business thriving: https:t.co hATwcXnQED #BrexitTransition pic ChCaxvGHmdash Defra UKDecember , According to the EU, the CFP ldquogives all European fishing fleets equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds and allows fishermen to compete fairly.In practice, this means all EU countries can fish within  nautical miles of the UK coast and vice versa.Criticism of the equal access agreement usually focuses on the argument that the UK has a relatively large fishing zone compared to many EU members and, as a result, EU fishermen benefit more from access to UK waters than the other way around.ndash What are the statistics An October report from the MMO said between  and , EU- vessels landed an estimated average of , tonnes of fish from UK waters with a value of pound million per year, representing % of their total by weight.In comparison, UK vessels landed , tonnes from EU- waters, equating to just % of its total haul.However, chip shop staples of cod and haddock are largely imported from EU- states, at , tonnes and , tonnes in  respectively, and the UK is a net exporter of mackerel and herring, selling , tonnes and , tonnes to the EU last year.ndash What is the situation with quotas The CFP sets quotas of how many of each fish species can be caught in a certain area to ensure the industry is sustainable.Each country is annually given a quota based on the total available for each species, with each countryrsquos limit based on historical fishing patterns of each country which, it is argued, are unfavourable to the UK.ndash What could happen next The UK will, either with or without a deal, become an independent coastal state in the new year. Without an agreement, it will have control of a -mile Exclusive Economic Zone , as conferred by the United Nationrsquos Convention on the Law of the Sea.In its February Future Relationship with the EU document, the UK Government said ldquofuture fishing opportunities should be based on the principle of zonal attachment, as is the case with the EUrsquos agreement with Norway.There, the EU and Norwegian governments jointly agree quotas to manage stocks and an exchange of fishing rights.ndash How could the impasse be overcome Reports suggest UK negotiators are proposing removing pelagic fish ndash the likes of mackerel and whiting ndash from the fisheries aspect of the negotiations in a bid to break the deadlock.ndash How has politics played a part Fishing, although a small fraction of national industry, is key to many of the places where it takes place.Francersquos Emmanuel Macron has warned his country will veto any Brexit deal, suggesting anxiety over what Michel Barnier is preparing to give up in his determination to secure an agreement.Mr Macron has maintained a hard line on fishing, with his country set to go to the polls in . Regions including Brittany and Normandy ndash key fishing areas ndash are likely to be vital in the race for the presidency.Similarly, on the UK side, an independent fisheries policy is seen as part of ldquotaking back control, with then fisheries minister George Eustice saying in January: ldquoFor many people in coastal communities, leaving the Common Fisheries Policy is at the heart of getting Brexit done..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Brexit and fishing rights: Key questions answered article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdabdaeedff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbaadadbfad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
