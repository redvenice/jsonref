This image, released as part of a trove of photos to mark the 100th anniversary of their execution, shows Russian soldiers posing for pictures at the beginning of the First World War in the summer 1914          Another image shows Alexei, the young son of Tsar Nicholas, wrapped in a blanket on a horse drawn cart  in 1912 - the year that he nearly died having been diagnosed with hemophilia. Alexei had jumped into a rowing boat and hit one of the oarlocks, suffering a large bruise in the process. Weeks later the condition worsened when the juddering from a carriage caused the hematoma to rupture. By October his condition had improved          Images within the #Romanovs100 project not only present their public, but also private lives, including games of tennis, lessons with tutors, and walks with beloved pets who stood by their side until the end. It is a century since the execution of Russia\u0027s last Tsar and his family after the revolution that established the Soviet Union, a massacre that still raises questions today. This picture was taken at the onset of the First World War in 1914Images within the #Romanovs100 project not only present their public, but also private lives, including games of tennis, lessons with tutors, and walks with beloved pets who stood by their side until the end. It is a century since the execution of Russia\u0027s last Tsar and his family after the revolution that established the Soviet Union, a massacre that still raises questions today. In February 1917, at the height of World War I, desperation at troop losses and food shortages caused mass rioting in the imperial capital Petrograd, today called Saint Petersburg.The revolt escalated and thousands joined, leading Nicholas II to deploy the army. But the soldiers mutinied and the little-loved Tsar abdicated in March.His departure brought the curtain down on the Romanov dynasty that had ruled Russia for 300 years.A fragile provisional government took over but was quickly overthrown by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\u0027s Marxist Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union was created. Nicholas sought asylum, including in Britain where King George V was his first cousin, but was rejected.           An image from the album shows how the Romanovs helped the wounded during the First World War, with medical vehicles bringing casualties in for treatment in 1915           Medical vehicles are lined up as they bring in soldiers wounded during the First World War in 1915 in another fascinating image from the newly released album          One of the images from 1918 shows the inside of Ipatiev house where the family was killed. In the early hours of July 17, 1918, Bolshevik police ordered the prisoners to the cellar of the house where they were being held. There the head of a squad of secret police, Yakov Yurovski, announced an order had been issued for their execution          The Romanovs made visits to Europe in the years before the revolution. They are pictured here, meeting with their family in Germany in 1910          The Tsar\u0027s children Maria, Alexei, Tatiana, Olga and Anastasia are pictued in 1912 at their Livadia summer residence in Crimea. This image was taken on White Flower Day - a regular event for the Anti-Tuberculosis League at the time. They are shown holding staffs of flowers, after walking about the city of Yalta,  receiving donations and handing out flowers in returnThe family and a handful of aides were arrested and moved to Siberia and then to Yekaterinburg, far from the seat of power.When anti-Bolshevik \u0027White\u0027 Russian forces approached, local authorities were ordered to prevent a rescue.In the early hours of July 17, 1918, Bolshevik police ordered the prisoners to the cellar of the house where they were being held.There the head of a squad of secret police, Yakov Yurovski, announced an order had been issued for their execution.\u0027Nicholas turned and, astonished, tried to ask a question. Yurovski repeated his statement and, without hesitation, shouted: \u0027Fire!\u0027,\u0027 historian Robert Service recounts in \u0027The Last of the Tsars\u0027 (2017).Nicholas, his German-born wife Alexandra, their five children - aged from their early teens to early 20s - were killed, along with a maid, cook, valet and doctor. By some accounts it was a bloody and brutal scene.\u0027The first bullets did not bring death to the youngest ones and they were savagely killed with blows of bayonets and gun-butts and with shots at point-blank range,\u0027 says the Russian Orthodox Church, which regards the family as martyrs, on its website.The bodies were reportedly hastily buried in an unmarked grave on the outskirts of Yekaterinburg. The remains of Nicholas, his wife and three of their daughters - Anastasia, Olga and Tatiana - were tracked down by two amateur historians in 1979, although the discovery was only revealed in 1991, in the dying days of the Soviet Union.           Opulence: One of the images in the collection, from 1911, shows how a new palace was built in Livadia in Crimea that became the Romanovs’ summer residence. They were famous for saying \u0027in Livadia we live but in St. Petersburg we work\u0027          Pictured is one of the events to mark the Tercentenary of the ruling Romanov Dynasty in 1913. A country-wide celebration was held for the entire year, which included religious ceremonies (pictured)          One of the key events in 1913 to mark the Tercentenary of the ruling Romanov Dynasty was a symbolic tour on the Volga river in May, when Nicholas II and his family followed the route of the first Romanov Tsar, Mikhail I, from Kostroma to Moscow          Hundreds of people lined the streets, including religious figures, for the many celebrations to mark the Tercentenary of the ruling Romanov Dynasty in 1913Exhumed and identified, they were buried in the imperial tomb in Saint Petersburg in July 1998 in a grandiose ceremony attended by president Boris Yeltsin.The execution was \u0027one of the most shameful pages in our history\u0027, the result of \u0027an irreconcilable ide in Russian society,\u0027 Yeltsin said.Amid popular legend that one of the children may have survived, several pretenders claimed later to be Anastasia, some seeking access to the royal fortune. They were always dismissed by the authorities.Bone fragments were found in 2007 that investigators and geneticists have said are from the two remaining children, heir Alexei and his sister Maria.But the powerful Orthodox Church doubts their identity and the remains lie in boxes in state archives, attempts to rebury them stalled. The Church in 2000 accorded the entire family the status of martyrs because of their faith.            The Romanovs made a visit the Cowes on the Isle of Wight in 1909. Under a decade later, they were dead. Nicholas, his German-born wife Alexandra, their five children - aged from their early teens to early 20s - were killed in July 1918, along with a maid, cook, valet and doctor in . By some accounts it was a bloody and brutal scene          This image, taken in 1917 in the town of Tsarskoe Selo, near St Petersburg, shows Tsar Nicholas in the centre, with daughters Maria (on the left) and Olga (on the right)          The Russian Tsar is pictured meeting King Edward VII in 1908 on the Imperial Royal yacht, the Standart, during one of the many royal engagements the family enjoyed before the revolutionIn 2008 Russia\u0027s Supreme Court formally rehabilitated Nicholas II, declaring that he and his family were unlawfully killed by Soviet authorities.But a long-running investigation into who was responsible closed in 2011 without finding evidence that Lenin had himself ordered the execution. It nonetheless apportioned him some blame for approving the killings and not punishing the executors.There is \u0027no reliable document proving the instigation of Lenin\u0027 or his regional chief Yakov Sverdlov, a top investigator said in an AFP story at the time.However, \u0027when they heard that the whole family had been shot, they officially approved the shooting,\u0027 the investigator said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/19/4E35441800000578-5951733-image-a-54_1531507612445.jpg","title":"Reexamined Dare Stone solve mystery Lost Colony Roanoke","story":"The mystery of what happened to the Lost Colony of Roanoke has remained unsolved for the last 428 years, though a reexamination of a stone that was found in 1937 could be the key to explaining what happened to the 115 men, women and children. The Dare Stone (either side is pictured) – named because it is believed to be written by Eleanor White Dare, Roanoke Governor John White\u0027s daughter – was found  on the North Carolina-Virginia border          In a recent study done by Brenau University, who owns the Dare Stone, a small part of it was cut off for an analysis of the chemicals and minerals present. The elements they found have helped determine where in Virginia the stone is likely from. However, more work is needed to figure out if the stone is a forgery or notMorrison heard about the Dare Stones for the first time 11 years ago, during his first week on the job at the university.\u0027I had never heard of them and I was sitting at my desk one day and I got an email message from somebody that wanted to know why we were hiding away these valuable artifacts in a 16th century mausoleum and wanted to know why,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com.\u0027It was kind of odd because there was no Georgia in the 16th century, let alone Brenau University with a mausoleum,\u0027 he says. The state of Georgia was founded in 1732 and the university in 1878.Soon after the accusatory email, Morrison says he got dozens of other inquiries from people who wanted to take rubbings of the Dare Stones. He found out that was a scavenger hunt task created to promote the 400th anniversary celebration of Jamestown. He also found out who sent that first email.Los Angeles police hunt for USC PhD student, 22, who...¿She was murdered¿: Cold case breakthrough as police find...Rare and unseen pictures of The Who taken by super-fan who...Share this article    The Lost Colony of Roanoke has captured the world\u0027s imagination for hundreds of years, in some ways particularly because among the missing colonists is the first English child to be born in the New World, Virginia Dare (pictured in a woodcut in \u0027North Carolina Illustrated\u0027 in Harperís New Monthly Magazine, 1857)He adds later: \u0027It\u0027s just a good story is what happened to that colony. You could simplify it and say they signed everybody up saying well we\u0027re trying to start a colony at that location several times and it hasn\u0027t worked out because it\u0027s just too dangerous. If the Indians don\u0027t get you, the weather will… and that\u0027s probably what happened to them, one or the other. And so, mystery solved. But that\u0027s not good enough. People really want to know the whole story.\u0027After two other groups had previously landed at Roanoke Island – the first to explore and chart the area in 1584 and the second to unsuccessfully attempt a colony in 1586 before returning to England a year later – Governor John White led a group of about 115 men, women and children, including his pregnant daughter Eleanor White Dare, to the site in 1587. Several weeks after they landed there on August 18, Eleanor gave birth to the first English baby born in the New World and named her Virginia Dare.Governor White soon returned to England to ask for more supplies, but he was held up in England for three years while the English warred with Spain. When he was finally able to make it back in 1590 on his granddaughter\u0027s third birthday, Roanoke was empty. Houses were dismantled and there wasn\u0027t a person in sight. There was also no sign of their agreed-upon emergency symbol: a cross. The only hints at the colonists\u0027 whereabouts were the letters \u0027Cro\u0027 carved on a tree and the word \u0027Croatoan\u0027 carved on a gatepost.Croatoan was an island south of Roanoke as well as the name of a Native American tribe who had befriended the colonists, according to a new book about Roanoke called The Secret Token by Andrew Lawler. According to his notes, Governor White was relieved to know the colonists were safe.Bad weather conditions prevented White from going to the second island and he was instead forced to return to England. The Roanoke colonists were never seen again.The mystery has sparked plenty of theories, both realistic and outlandish. Plausible theories suggest they died from disease, were massacred by either Native Americans or Spanish settlers or assimilated into a nearby Native American tribe, either as friends or slaves. More fantastic theories include alien abductions or death by zombie apocalypse.Twenty years after Roanoke was founded, the more successful colony of Jamestown was settled 100 miles north in Virginia by the Virginia Company of London in 1607. Though this colony was threatened with failure after two years of disease, famine and conflict, a second group of settlers in 1610 ensured Jamestown\u0027s success.          The Lost Colony of Roanoke\u0027s mystery became popular in 1937 when then-President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated a commemorative stamp to Virginia Dare for her 350th birthday. In the same year, a man named Louis Hammond claimed he found a 21-pound stone on the North Carolina-Virginia border. The stone had undecipherable carvings on it, so he brought it to Emory University\u0027s history department hoping someone there could read it. Three of the Emory scholars Haywood Pearce, Jr (center), James G Lester (left) and Ben W Gibson (right) are pictured with the Dare Stone          The Emory scholars were able to translate the messages on either side of the stone, which tells the gruesome and sad fate of the Roanoke colonists, if it is authentic. However, there were some doubts of the stone\u0027s authenticity among the higher ups at Emory, so Brenau University bought it. Brenau was run by Haywood Pearce Jr\u0027s father    Pearce Jr was unsuccessful in finding any other Dare Stones, so he opened up the search to the public, promising that Brenau would pay anyone who found any stones with carvings on them. Brenau\u0027s current president, Ed Schrader (right), who is also a geologist, is pictured discussing different stones at the University of North Carolina in Asheville for a History Channel program about the Dare Stones           The Pearces were somehow convinced of their legitimacy, Lawler writes, but Eberhardt\u0027s hoax was soon uncovered by the Saturday Evening Post in 1941, which left Brenau embarrassed. Pictured: Flour is applied to the Dare Stones to try and match stones up with the translated text          \u0027Where do you put rocks?\u0027 Morrison says. \u0027We weren\u0027t crowing about them. We weren\u0027t showing them off or anything, but I don\u0027t think they were actually hiding them. I think they were just done with them. There was no champion for them around anymore and they just sort of languished around, no further advancement on them at all.\u0027 Schrader is pictured examining the original Dare Stone          In 2016, Brenau brought the Dare Stone to the geology department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where they have the equipment needed to cut a small part of the stone and do mineral and chemical analyses, which was also featured on a History Channel program in March 2017          The Dare Stone sits near a saw before a sample is taken during the filming of the 2017 History Channel program at the University of North Carolina Asheville          During the 2016 analysis, they found that the stone is almost completely pure white vein quartz with amounts of gold, selenium and copper, which helped narrow down the possible location of the stone to an area in southern Virginia, about 60 miles upriver from the approximate location of where the stone was found in 1937          Their next step, Morrison says, is to determine how thick the layer of patina, or film produced from oxidation, is around the stone, to pinpoint when the carving actually happened. They are also trying to put together a comprehensive team to thoroughly study the stone      ¿Dare Stone¿ Highlighted in Second Two-hour History Channel Program - Brenau University"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/16/4E58808800000578-5962949-image-a-69_1531842263273.jpg","title":"World Emoji Day 2018 need know","story":"Is a Fortnite TV show coming to Disney XD?Twitter reacts to Jason Momoa\u0027s new Aquaman poster with memesESPYs 2018: When is it, nominees, tickets and moreNelson Mandela International Day 2018: Everything you need to knowCelebrity Big Brother 2018: All you need to knowTake That tour: All you need to know about the 30th anniversary Greatest Hits tourGoogle and the United Nations Environment Programme to partner to monitor environmental changesWorld Emoji Day 2018: Everything you need to knowFortnite server crash sees players flood to PornhubEllen DeGeneres\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after making the Forbes Celebrity 100 list Ellen DeGeneres\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after making the Forbes Celebrity 100 list Bachelorette spoilers: Will Becca Kufrin \u0027pull an Arie\u0027 and break up with the winner?Miss Universe Great Britain\u0027s Dee-Ann Kentish-Rogers revealed after becoming first black woman to hold the title Donald Trump is the first result if you Google Image search \u0027idiot\u0027 Who will win Love Island 2018?

Instead, they pay rising annual fees to the freeholder, and often face onerous terms that can prevent them carrying out home improvements.Former Communities Secretary Sajid Javid described leasehold sales as ‘unjustified’ and last year announced a ban that will force developers to sell new homes as freehold.But despite the crackdown, there are no laws to help the hundreds of thousands of families who have already bought leasehold homes. Experts believe these properties will soon be seen as ‘damaged goods’ and may become hard to sell as their values fall.This week, Money Mail found two estates in Lancashire which were still being marketed as leasehold. Homes on the Douglas Meadow estate, outside Chorley, are on the market from Stewart Milne Homes for £267,950 for a detached four-bedroom or £399,950 for a five-bedroom, with shared landscaped park and play areas. Each house is leasehold and owners pay an annual ground rent of £250, which is reviewed in line with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation every ten years.Leasehold homes on the Jones Homes estate at Rivington Grange, in Horwich, Bolton, cost up to £199,950 for a three-bedroom, while a four-bedroom semi costs up to £252,950. Ground rents are understood to be about £200 a year for a £200,000 house, and are reviewed every 15 years in line with inflation.The used cars RISING in value: Buyers are snapping up...China\u0027s £1.7bn raid for British tech talent... as another UK...Royal Mail letter volumes decline as new data rules bite...Boardroom blitz!

Many of those hit were first-time buyers, some of whom used the Government’s Help to Buy scheme to purchase homes with a 5per cent deposit. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equity.Typically the leases they have last between 250 and 999 years. In some cases, their annual rent to the freeholder - who owns the land under the property - is scheduled to double every decade. That means a ground rent which starts at £250 a year rises to £500 a year after ten years, £1,000 after 20 years and £2,000 after 30.For property developers, this income stream can be lucrative. Many builders make extra profit by selling the freeholds - and all future ground rent income - to investment firms.          Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000In theory, homeowners retain the right to buy the freehold at a later date under the Leasehold Reform Act. But the prices set by freeholders can be tens of thousands of pounds. The contracts also state that leaseholders who want to make changes to their home - for instance, adding a conservatory - must often seek permission from the freeholder and pay a fee.Some who bought leasehold houses are already struggling to move home. Potential buyers fear the properties could become unsellable after the ban comes into force, and solicitors warn that banks have stopped lending on many leasehold properties where ground rents are due to double every decade.Some banks are refusing to offer loans if the ground rent is more than 0.1per cent of the property’s value (i.e. £100 a year on a £100,000 flat). Karen and David Wilson had feared the leasehold scandal would leave them £92,000 out of pocket. In 2012, they bought a two-bed flat in Leeds from a private seller for their son Ben, now 35.          An estimated 200,000 families are stuck with blighted leasehold homes. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equityThe family tried to sell when Ben, a teacher, decided to move back to their home town of Ulverston in Cumbria. They found a buyer, but a day before completion the purchaser pulled out. Their solicitor had highlighted that the flat had a doubling ground rent clause in the lease.The family begged the freeholder to link the ground rent to RPI inflation instead, which should make it easier to sell. It initially refused, but relented after Money Mail intervened.Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000. Now she needs to move to provide more space for her three children, two of whom have autism. She struggles to afford the £500 ground rent, which is set to double every ten years.But homes on the estate have sold at tens of thousands of pounds less than their original price, she says. Catherine adds that although she knew the property was leasehold, she had little idea of what this meant. The developer, Taylor Wimpey, has since offered to allow Catherine and other owners on the estate the chance to link their ground rents to RPI inflation. It argues that this should make it cheaper for sellers to buy the freehold.But under Catherine’s current arrangement, ground rents can only increase five times under the RPI deal being offered, the number of increases will be unlimited. And if owners such as Catherine sign up for the change, they must waive their rights to take legal action against Taylor Wimpey over the doubling ground-rent clause. Catherine says: ‘I feel angry that we are all stuck.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We listened to the concerns and difficulties some customers were facing as a result of their doubling ground-rent lease terms and have taken action to put it right.‘We have reached agreements with our freeholders who own their leases to enable the majority of customers with a ten-year doubling lease to convert their ground rent to an RPI‑based structure.‘The use of RPI-linked leases is a nationally recognised and long-established measure, and is the most commonly used index for price increases across the leasehold residential sector.’Tory Sir Peter Bottomley, who has campaigned on leasehold issues, says: ‘The people responsible for this scandal - the Government, developers and freeholders - have to fund a solution that is equitable and effective for families stuck with toxic leases.’A Stewart Milne Homes spokesman says: ‘All our developments in the North-West have been freehold since January 1, 2018, with the exception of Douglas Meadow, which was not available for us to purchase on a freehold basis.‘We have waived all admin charges and fees and arranged for a long lease that tracks the Retail Price Index to ensure there are no unexpected increases for our home buyers.’A Jones Homes spokesman declined to comment. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/20/4E5992A900000578-5963783-image-a-55_1531854119751.jpg","title":"Dad makes Philippines typhoon turns house indoor swimming pool","story":"    Reynaldo Bautista, 45, makes the most of a bad situation as he is seen reclining in his flooded living room boasting of his \u0027private swimming pool\u0027          The father-of-two pulled on his swimming trunks for the occasion, telling family members: \u0027come on in, the water\u0027s warm\u0027Bautista even pulled on his swimming trunks for the occasion, adding :\u0027Come on, let\u0027s take a bath. This flood has given us a private swimming pool.\u0027The footage was filmed at Bautista\u0027s home in Bulacan province on July 14.

How can I give, more, and more, and more?\u0027\u0027Obama was speaking months after Donald Trump came under fire for his tax reform which cut taxes for the rich and corporations, and reduced deductions for the middle class.It included plans to eliminate the federal estate tax, a levy paid only by estates worth more than $5.5 million for iniduals and $11 million for couple, and to scrap the alternative minimum tax, a supplemental tax which only effects households who earn more than $200,000.It also dropped corporate tax rates to just 20 per cent, benefiting wealthy business owners, and axed tax deductions for many middle class Americans such as student loan interest deduction and state and local tax deduction.          \u0027There\u0027s only so big a house you can have,\u0027 he added (the Obamas\u0027 Washington DC house in the upmarket Kalorama neighbourhood)          He also told the crowd on Tuesday that \u0027There\u0027s only so much you can eat,\u0027 before it was time to share the wealthThe legislation was generally unpopular but passed, giving Republicans, who promised tax reform in the election, a win. When Trump first floated the plan during his campaign, Obama had criticized it, saying it would only \u0027help people like him.\u0027In a speech on the economy in Indiana in June, 2016, he said: \u0027That will not bring jobs back,\u0027 Obama said.\u0027That is not fighting for the American middle class. That will not help us win. That is not going to make your lives better. That will help people like him.\u0027In contrast, President Obama\u0027s administration implemented a small raise on taxes, mostly to help pay for Obamacare, and put a bigger focus on using tax policy to readdress wealth distribution. But there no significant raises, despite claims from the Republicans that Obama was responsible for hikes, and president number 44 had  even signed a compromise bill making permanent the tax cuts enacted by George W.

Shortly after Neil listed the first item - a 2014 Kubota compact tractor (pictured above) for £5,600, plus £160 for delivery from Aberdeen - he started receiving emails from potential buyersMost wanted to view the vehicle before buying. This is a common request because eBay does not provide a money-back guarantee on vehicles sold through its website. But when Neil asked Sandberg if this was possible, he was told to say no.One buyer asked if the tractor was in full working order, why Neil was selling it, if he was the original owner and whether he was able to supply the original manuals and purchase documents.Neil went back to Sandberg, who told him to say that the tractor was in perfect working order and was being sold due to lack of space. Neil was told to say he was the original owner and would supply all the relevant paperwork.Foolishly, Neil went along with Sandberg\u0027s suggestion and the buyer paid £5,760 into Neil\u0027s PayPal account on the understanding that the tractor would be delivered within three days.As soon as the payment had been made, Sandberg asked Neil to transfer the money to his account. Sandberg said this was urgent because he wouldn\u0027t be able to deliver the vehicle to the buyer until he had received the money, as he had to pay his suppliers and delivery fees.          NatWest has refused to help Neil clear his debtsSandberg wrote: \u0027You will need to have a little trust in this deal, otherwise I will need you to cancel the transaction and refund the buyer.\u0027Neil then transferred the £5,026 to Sandberg\u0027s NatWest account, taking £734 for himself to cover his commission and eBay fees. The next day Sandberg sent Neil a new vehicle to list - a 2000 John Deere 4x4 tractor costing £4,500 plus £160 delivery. But this time a buyer messaged Neil shortly after making payment to say he\u0027d spotted the exact same photos of the tractor on an American website.It was at this point that Neil became suspicious that something was seriously wrong.When Neil asked Sandberg to confirm the vehicle was in his possession, he became defensive and ordered Neil to transfer payment immediately. Neil says: \u0027I told him if he was a legitimate seller there wouldn\u0027t be a problem. I tried to call him and couldn\u0027t get through so I sent a message saying unless he could show me the paperwork, I wasn\u0027t going to pay him.\u0027Sandberg never replied, so Neil thanked the buyer for bringing the photos to his attention and agreed to refund the payment, explaining that they had both been a victim of a scam. He contacted eBay and Action Fraud, the cybercrime reporting service, and his own bank The Cooperative Bank. But several weeks later, £5,760 was removed from his PayPal account.It turned out that the first buyer\u0027s bank had clawed back the payment for the 2014 Kubota compact tractor which had never been delivered. Banks can do this under so-called Chargeback rules for debit cards or Section 75 rules for credit cards.This plunged Neil thousands of pounds into debt. His PayPal and eBay account have been disabled until he repays the money, which he says he does not have. Neil has since discovered Sandberg\u0027s scam was linked to a larger police investigation into online fraud.In June, Money Mail revealed that nine major banks had allowed 82 accounts to be opened by a criminal gang using fake passports, driving licences and utility bills.Police found Sandberg\u0027s NatWest account among these and confirmed to Money Mail that Neil was a victim of crime. PayPal, however, is still demanding payment.Neil says: \u0027I told PayPal the fraudster owes them the money. I said the police were dealing with it. I shouldn\u0027t be liable for this debt.\u0027The bank should also take some responsibility. NatWest gave the criminal an account with fake documents.

Between March and May, the number of full-time workers increased to a new high of 23.9 million.The 388,000 figure is the equivalent of 1,063 jobs being created every day.Part-time workers decreased on the previous three months by 40,000 to 8.5million, despite the popularity of ‘gig economy’ jobs working for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo.

Although the jobs growth is encouraging, the slowing rises in pay could mean an interest rate hike will hamper consumer spending.A drop in stay-at-home carers led to a decline in the number of people not in work and not looking to work.

The 78-year-old reckons it was roughly £140, including storage, and thought at the time that it seemed like a fairly good deal.But last month her daughter Debbie Folkes read an article in the Mail about how some of the wills sold by banks such as NatWest included onerous terms and conditions that leave grieving families thousands of pounds out of pocket.When Debbie dug out the will, she discovered her mother had fallen victim to a major money‑making ploy used by nearly all the major banks in the late Nineties and early Noughties. In the small print, NatWest had reserved the right to act as executor of the will when Barbara died.That means NatWest and its solicitors, rather than Debbie or another family member or trusted friend, will be responsible for wrapping up her estate and dealing with everything from property sales to inheritance tax.In return for this service, the bank states it will charge a £1,500 administration fee and a whopping 2.5per cent of her mum\u0027s total estate (plus VAT). The estate is currently worth around £220,000 - so this works out at £7,000 plus VAT.The bank claims that Barbara chose to appoint NatWest as executor and that it was clear about its fees.

I am horrified NatWest could demand this money when they die.\u0027Barbara and Debbie are among dozens of readers who have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banks.Families have begun trawling through the small print of their contracts and say they have discovered huge charges they knew nothing about. Some described how they successfully begged for a reduction in the fees. One man managed to get the fee cut from £14,000 to £6,000 after challenging his parents\u0027 bank.          Dozens of readers  have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banksAnother family faced a £32,000 bill to administer their mother\u0027s estate, only for the bank to refuse to help when the will was challenged by a relative.Around the turn of the millennium, many major banks offered wills for as little as £75, or even at no upfront cost. They could afford to do this because they had loaded the terms and conditions with a catch that stated that the bank could appoint itself as executor of the will. That meant when the customer died, the bank could charge as much as 4.5per cent on the first £100,000 of the estate.Accountants say unless the estate is extremely complex, this can end up being hugely expensive. This is particularly true for modest estates that have benefited from soaring house prices.Jonathan Hoffman, an accountant who has advised on cases involving inheritance tax and wills since the Seventies, says: \u0027Banks should be charging an hourly fee based on how long it takes to deal with an estate.\u0027There is no reason why a simple case involving passing an estate between a husband and wife should be any more than ten hours of work. Even charged at £200 an hour this should amount to no more than £2,000.\u0027Some banks have reduced these fees in recent years — but they are still high. Lloyds, for example, charges 2.5per cent on the first £1 million of an estate. On a £500,000 estate this works out at £12,500.          When Sheena Hayes\u0027s aunt, Martha Mathers, died in 2008, Lloyds took £32,000 from her estate in charges for acting as an executor. Martha had died aged 81 without children, so left her estate - worth just under £1million - to eight nieces and nephews. Above, Sheena pictured with her familyNatWest charges 2.5per cent up to a maximum of £15,000 plus a £1,500 administration fee. A NatWest spokesman says: \u0027We offer upfront and transparent fees which are capped at a maximum amount. Where an estate is simple to administer we will look to offer a discount or, if appropriate, we will also offer the option for the bank to renounce. The bank is not automatically appointed as executor and customers are free to appoint a different executor at any time.\u0027The first Graham Penfold knew about these fees was when a smartly-dressed woman knocked on his mum\u0027s door a few days after his dad, Dennis, died 11 years ago. Graham and his wife Janice were staying at his family home in London to help his mum Margaret, then 79, plan the funeral and sort out his father\u0027s affairs.The woman said she had been sent by HSBC to discuss Dennis\u0027s will. Graham says she explained that the bank had been named as an executor and planned to charge £14,000 to administer the estate.          In the end, Graham and his family paid a total of £6,563 including VAT and legal advice fees for the will, with the breakdown of costs shown above. More than a decade later Graham, 66, says he still feel let down by the whole processA Lloyds Bank spokesman says it reimbursed the family for some of the solicitor\u0027s fees they incurred because of the challenging of the will.He says: \u0027We\u0027re sorry for Ms Hayes\u0027s loss of her aunt and the challenges she has had dealing with the estate. Family disputes, particularly involving larger estates, can be complex and occasionally result in additional legal issues which are not covered by standard fees. In this case, caveats were raised by family members which we tried to resolve with minimal legal costs. However, we were forced to seek specialist legal advice to resolve the situation.\u0027Another reader says her elderly friend\u0027s £310,000 estate was charged £16,000 by a bank to deal with matters after she died in 2008. This was on top of £4,406 paid to solicitors who handled the property sale.The reader also says she was told to contact the utility companies herself, along with sorting out other aspects of her friend\u0027s affairs.          From Money Mail\u0027s story last monthShe adds that she had no idea about the fees until she received the documents back from the bank around a year later. She says: \u0027At the time I just assumed that it was the typical charge for administering a will. But now I look back, I think that the bank did very little to earn such a huge fee.\u0027So if you\u0027ve discovered that your bank intends to charge you thousands of pounds to act as executor, what can you do?First, write to your bank and ask if it will stand down. Banks typically charge a fee of around £250 to remove their name as executor. However, if you live in England and Wales, it could refuse. (In Scotland they must agree to give up this responsibility when asked.)You can also try to negotiate to bring down the fees. If all else fails, tear it up and start again. In your new will, just include a line to clarify that it revokes all previous versions.If you opt for a professional writing service, choose the firm carefully will-writing is an unregulated business and there are rogue firms out there.Check that the company is signed up to an industry trade body, such as the Society of Will Writers or the Institute of Professional Will Writers. These enforce strict rules to which members must adhere. Solicitors are regulated by the Solicitors\u0027 Regulation Authority.You will likely be asked if you want to appoint the professional arranging your will as an executor. If your affairs are complicated, this could make sense. But check the fees. Beware if a firm tries to persuade you to appoint them as an executor. You may prefer to appoint a relative as an executor in the first place, particularly if your estate is relatively uncomplicated. If the executor needs legal help after you\u0027ve died, they can ask a probate broker such as Final Duties, which should provide a flat fee to deal with the estate.Even if your estate is more complex and you prefer a professional executor, then wherever possible try to include a relative as executor, too. They will understand your wishes better than a firm of solicitors.Most banks, including Zedra (which has taken over the Barclays probate business) and the Co-operative (which runs the former HSBC wills business), claim they will lower fees if an estate is very simple. NatWest says the same. So hold them to their word.Experts say as a rule of thumb that it should cost no more than £4,000 to administer a simple estate where no inheritance tax is due, savings are held in cash and there is a single property to be ided between your children.If an estate like this is being passed to your spouse, the fee should be even less. Higher charges may be justified if inheritance tax is due on the estate or if it includes stock market shares, which can take time to sell.If you or a loved one has already paid charges to the bank from the estate, you\u0027re unlikely to get your money back even if you believe the terms were unfair. However, it is still worth complaining to the bank. Lay out the fees and explain why you believe your loved one\u0027s estate was overcharged.If you do not get a satisfactory response, take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. You can make a complaint six years from the event or three years from the time that you knew (or could have reasonably known) you had cause to complain.Even if your loved one died long ago, it may be possible to argue that you realised that the fees were excessive only after reading about the issue in Money Mail this year. Good for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/11/4E4EF0CD00000578-0-image-a-9_1531736814853.jpg","title":"Holidaymakers losing 1bn debit credit card fees abroad","story":"    British holidaymakers are often unaware of extra bank fees when withdrawing money from foreign ATMsMoment \u0027British tourist snorts cocaine off his wrist\u0027 in...\u0027I thought we were all gone\u0027: Radio star reveals her brush...The taste of freedom!

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visits the Chungjin bag factory, which he said offered \u0027shabby rooms\u0027          He suffered \u0027great anxiety\u0027 during his inspection to the bag factory, above, according to the KCNAThe original plan was ordered by Kim\u0027s late grandfather, North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, 30 years ago.\u0027Kim pointed out that the cabinet has specified the project as a target project that should be accelerated,\u0027 the KCNA report said.Since taking power when his dictator father Kim Jong Il died in late 2011, Kim, 34, has promised to boost living standards and sought to project an image of youth and modernity while pushing hard to build up North Korea\u0027s nuclear capabilities.

She managed to break free when her mobile phone rang and she unlocked the door before escaping.The alleged incident was one of several unwanted advances made towards the woman by Ihsan between January and April last year after he rented the property in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.The GP was subsequently asked to leave by the managers at the apartment block after the woman complained.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the housekeeper had been employed to clean various flats at the complex where Ihsan had taken out a lease on a serviced property.Lawyers for the General Medical Council Helena Duong told the Manchester hearing: \u0027She was responsible for cleaning his room and on a number of occasions, he was present when she was cleaning the room.\u0027On one incident in her statement she went to the room to collect her keys which she had left behind and Dr Ihsan opened the door with a towel around his waist.

You told him it was your boss calling. He replied that there were not any cameras in the room but you said that your boss would know that you were in there and you quickly unlocked the front door.\u0027In November last year Ihsan was suspended for nine months after being found guilty of misconduct.He quizzed a patient about her sex life during a routine appointment, and he told a second patient he was \u0027horny\u0027 and asked to see her bottom at his surgery in South Kirby, Wakefield.  At the time Dr Ihsan said he acknowledged the seriousness of his actions and was sorry for what had happened. Ihsan, from Huddersfield, denies sexually motivated misconduct.

The Dare Stone (either side is pictured) – named because it is believed to be written by Eleanor White Dare, Roanoke Governor John White\u0027s daughter – was found  on the North Carolina-Virginia border          In a recent study done by Brenau University, who owns the Dare Stone, a small part of it was cut off for an analysis of the chemicals and minerals present. The elements they found have helped determine where in Virginia the stone is likely from. However, more work is needed to figure out if the stone is a forgery or notMorrison heard about the Dare Stones for the first time 11 years ago, during his first week on the job at the university.\u0027I had never heard of them and I was sitting at my desk one day and I got an email message from somebody that wanted to know why we were hiding away these valuable artifacts in a 16th century mausoleum and wanted to know why,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com.\u0027It was kind of odd because there was no Georgia in the 16th century, let alone Brenau University with a mausoleum,\u0027 he says. The state of Georgia was founded in 1732 and the university in 1878.Soon after the accusatory email, Morrison says he got dozens of other inquiries from people who wanted to take rubbings of the Dare Stones. He found out that was a scavenger hunt task created to promote the 400th anniversary celebration of Jamestown. He also found out who sent that first email.Los Angeles police hunt for USC PhD student, 22, who...¿She was murdered¿: Cold case breakthrough as police find...Rare and unseen pictures of The Who taken by super-fan who...Share this article    The Lost Colony of Roanoke has captured the world\u0027s imagination for hundreds of years, in some ways particularly because among the missing colonists is the first English child to be born in the New World, Virginia Dare (pictured in a woodcut in \u0027North Carolina Illustrated\u0027 in Harperís New Monthly Magazine, 1857)He adds later: \u0027It\u0027s just a good story is what happened to that colony. You could simplify it and say they signed everybody up saying well we\u0027re trying to start a colony at that location several times and it hasn\u0027t worked out because it\u0027s just too dangerous. If the Indians don\u0027t get you, the weather will… and that\u0027s probably what happened to them, one or the other. And so, mystery solved. But that\u0027s not good enough. People really want to know the whole story.\u0027After two other groups had previously landed at Roanoke Island – the first to explore and chart the area in 1584 and the second to unsuccessfully attempt a colony in 1586 before returning to England a year later – Governor John White led a group of about 115 men, women and children, including his pregnant daughter Eleanor White Dare, to the site in 1587. Several weeks after they landed there on August 18, Eleanor gave birth to the first English baby born in the New World and named her Virginia Dare.Governor White soon returned to England to ask for more supplies, but he was held up in England for three years while the English warred with Spain. When he was finally able to make it back in 1590 on his granddaughter\u0027s third birthday, Roanoke was empty. Houses were dismantled and there wasn\u0027t a person in sight. There was also no sign of their agreed-upon emergency symbol: a cross. The only hints at the colonists\u0027 whereabouts were the letters \u0027Cro\u0027 carved on a tree and the word \u0027Croatoan\u0027 carved on a gatepost.Croatoan was an island south of Roanoke as well as the name of a Native American tribe who had befriended the colonists, according to a new book about Roanoke called The Secret Token by Andrew Lawler. According to his notes, Governor White was relieved to know the colonists were safe.Bad weather conditions prevented White from going to the second island and he was instead forced to return to England. The Roanoke colonists were never seen again.The mystery has sparked plenty of theories, both realistic and outlandish. Plausible theories suggest they died from disease, were massacred by either Native Americans or Spanish settlers or assimilated into a nearby Native American tribe, either as friends or slaves. More fantastic theories include alien abductions or death by zombie apocalypse.Twenty years after Roanoke was founded, the more successful colony of Jamestown was settled 100 miles north in Virginia by the Virginia Company of London in 1607. Though this colony was threatened with failure after two years of disease, famine and conflict, a second group of settlers in 1610 ensured Jamestown\u0027s success.          The Lost Colony of Roanoke\u0027s mystery became popular in 1937 when then-President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated a commemorative stamp to Virginia Dare for her 350th birthday. In the same year, a man named Louis Hammond claimed he found a 21-pound stone on the North Carolina-Virginia border. The stone had undecipherable carvings on it, so he brought it to Emory University\u0027s history department hoping someone there could read it. Three of the Emory scholars Haywood Pearce, Jr (center), James G Lester (left) and Ben W Gibson (right) are pictured with the Dare Stone          The Emory scholars were able to translate the messages on either side of the stone, which tells the gruesome and sad fate of the Roanoke colonists, if it is authentic. However, there were some doubts of the stone\u0027s authenticity among the higher ups at Emory, so Brenau University bought it. Brenau was run by Haywood Pearce Jr\u0027s father    Pearce Jr was unsuccessful in finding any other Dare Stones, so he opened up the search to the public, promising that Brenau would pay anyone who found any stones with carvings on them. Brenau\u0027s current president, Ed Schrader (right), who is also a geologist, is pictured discussing different stones at the University of North Carolina in Asheville for a History Channel program about the Dare Stones           The Pearces were somehow convinced of their legitimacy, Lawler writes, but Eberhardt\u0027s hoax was soon uncovered by the Saturday Evening Post in 1941, which left Brenau embarrassed. Pictured: Flour is applied to the Dare Stones to try and match stones up with the translated text          \u0027Where do you put rocks?\u0027 Morrison says. \u0027We weren\u0027t crowing about them.

Instead, they pay rising annual fees to the freeholder, and often face onerous terms that can prevent them carrying out home improvements.Former Communities Secretary Sajid Javid described leasehold sales as ‘unjustified’ and last year announced a ban that will force developers to sell new homes as freehold.But despite the crackdown, there are no laws to help the hundreds of thousands of families who have already bought leasehold homes. Experts believe these properties will soon be seen as ‘damaged goods’ and may become hard to sell as their values fall.This week, Money Mail found two estates in Lancashire which were still being marketed as leasehold. Homes on the Douglas Meadow estate, outside Chorley, are on the market from Stewart Milne Homes for £267,950 for a detached four-bedroom or £399,950 for a five-bedroom, with shared landscaped park and play areas. Each house is leasehold and owners pay an annual ground rent of £250, which is reviewed in line with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation every ten years.Leasehold homes on the Jones Homes estate at Rivington Grange, in Horwich, Bolton, cost up to £199,950 for a three-bedroom, while a four-bedroom semi costs up to £252,950. Ground rents are understood to be about £200 a year for a £200,000 house, and are reviewed every 15 years in line with inflation.The used cars RISING in value: Buyers are snapping up...China\u0027s £1.7bn raid for British tech talent... as another UK...Royal Mail letter volumes decline as new data rules bite...Boardroom blitz!

Many of those hit were first-time buyers, some of whom used the Government’s Help to Buy scheme to purchase homes with a 5per cent deposit. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equity.Typically the leases they have last between 250 and 999 years. In some cases, their annual rent to the freeholder - who owns the land under the property - is scheduled to double every decade. That means a ground rent which starts at £250 a year rises to £500 a year after ten years, £1,000 after 20 years and £2,000 after 30.For property developers, this income stream can be lucrative. Many builders make extra profit by selling the freeholds - and all future ground rent income - to investment firms.          Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000In theory, homeowners retain the right to buy the freehold at a later date under the Leasehold Reform Act. But the prices set by freeholders can be tens of thousands of pounds. The contracts also state that leaseholders who want to make changes to their home - for instance, adding a conservatory - must often seek permission from the freeholder and pay a fee.Some who bought leasehold houses are already struggling to move home. Potential buyers fear the properties could become unsellable after the ban comes into force, and solicitors warn that banks have stopped lending on many leasehold properties where ground rents are due to double every decade.Some banks are refusing to offer loans if the ground rent is more than 0.1per cent of the property’s value (i.e. £100 a year on a £100,000 flat). Karen and David Wilson had feared the leasehold scandal would leave them £92,000 out of pocket. In 2012, they bought a two-bed flat in Leeds from a private seller for their son Ben, now 35.          An estimated 200,000 families are stuck with blighted leasehold homes. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equityThe family tried to sell when Ben, a teacher, decided to move back to their home town of Ulverston in Cumbria. They found a buyer, but a day before completion the purchaser pulled out. Their solicitor had highlighted that the flat had a doubling ground rent clause in the lease.The family begged the freeholder to link the ground rent to RPI inflation instead, which should make it easier to sell. It initially refused, but relented after Money Mail intervened.Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000. Now she needs to move to provide more space for her three children, two of whom have autism. She struggles to afford the £500 ground rent, which is set to double every ten years.But homes on the estate have sold at tens of thousands of pounds less than their original price, she says. Catherine adds that although she knew the property was leasehold, she had little idea of what this meant. The developer, Taylor Wimpey, has since offered to allow Catherine and other owners on the estate the chance to link their ground rents to RPI inflation. It argues that this should make it cheaper for sellers to buy the freehold.But under Catherine’s current arrangement, ground rents can only increase five times under the RPI deal being offered, the number of increases will be unlimited. And if owners such as Catherine sign up for the change, they must waive their rights to take legal action against Taylor Wimpey over the doubling ground-rent clause. Catherine says: ‘I feel angry that we are all stuck.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We listened to the concerns and difficulties some customers were facing as a result of their doubling ground-rent lease terms and have taken action to put it right.‘We have reached agreements with our freeholders who own their leases to enable the majority of customers with a ten-year doubling lease to convert their ground rent to an RPI‑based structure.‘The use of RPI-linked leases is a nationally recognised and long-established measure, and is the most commonly used index for price increases across the leasehold residential sector.’Tory Sir Peter Bottomley, who has campaigned on leasehold issues, says: ‘The people responsible for this scandal - the Government, developers and freeholders - have to fund a solution that is equitable and effective for families stuck with toxic leases.’A Stewart Milne Homes spokesman says: ‘All our developments in the North-West have been freehold since January 1, 2018, with the exception of Douglas Meadow, which was not available for us to purchase on a freehold basis.‘We have waived all admin charges and fees and arranged for a long lease that tracks the Retail Price Index to ensure there are no unexpected increases for our home buyers.’A Jones Homes spokesman declined to comment. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/16/4E200E2E00000578-0-image-m-34_1531323892886.jpg","title":"Navy veteran tells duped selling bogus tractors eBay","story":"    Defrauded: Neil Burns was offered a job selling farm vehicles on eBay.

And the tractors and other farm equipment he\u0027d listed did not exist. Worse still, Neil has ended up on the hook for more than £5,000 after an innocent shopper clawed back payment for undelivered goods.Neil, a qualified engineer from Hampshire, heard about the job through a legitimate website called People Per Hour, which connects freelance workers with businesses.In September last year he received an email from a People Per Hour user who called himself \u0027Thomas Sandberg\u0027.The used cars RISING in value: Buyers are snapping up...China\u0027s £1.7bn raid for British tech talent... as another UK...Royal Mail letter volumes decline as new data rules bite...Boardroom blitz!

Shortly after Neil listed the first item - a 2014 Kubota compact tractor (pictured above) for £5,600, plus £160 for delivery from Aberdeen - he started receiving emails from potential buyersMost wanted to view the vehicle before buying. This is a common request because eBay does not provide a money-back guarantee on vehicles sold through its website. But when Neil asked Sandberg if this was possible, he was told to say no.One buyer asked if the tractor was in full working order, why Neil was selling it, if he was the original owner and whether he was able to supply the original manuals and purchase documents.Neil went back to Sandberg, who told him to say that the tractor was in perfect working order and was being sold due to lack of space. Neil was told to say he was the original owner and would supply all the relevant paperwork.Foolishly, Neil went along with Sandberg\u0027s suggestion and the buyer paid £5,760 into Neil\u0027s PayPal account on the understanding that the tractor would be delivered within three days.As soon as the payment had been made, Sandberg asked Neil to transfer the money to his account. Sandberg said this was urgent because he wouldn\u0027t be able to deliver the vehicle to the buyer until he had received the money, as he had to pay his suppliers and delivery fees.          NatWest has refused to help Neil clear his debtsSandberg wrote: \u0027You will need to have a little trust in this deal, otherwise I will need you to cancel the transaction and refund the buyer.\u0027Neil then transferred the £5,026 to Sandberg\u0027s NatWest account, taking £734 for himself to cover his commission and eBay fees. The next day Sandberg sent Neil a new vehicle to list - a 2000 John Deere 4x4 tractor costing £4,500 plus £160 delivery. But this time a buyer messaged Neil shortly after making payment to say he\u0027d spotted the exact same photos of the tractor on an American website.It was at this point that Neil became suspicious that something was seriously wrong.When Neil asked Sandberg to confirm the vehicle was in his possession, he became defensive and ordered Neil to transfer payment immediately. Neil says: \u0027I told him if he was a legitimate seller there wouldn\u0027t be a problem. I tried to call him and couldn\u0027t get through so I sent a message saying unless he could show me the paperwork, I wasn\u0027t going to pay him.\u0027Sandberg never replied, so Neil thanked the buyer for bringing the photos to his attention and agreed to refund the payment, explaining that they had both been a victim of a scam. He contacted eBay and Action Fraud, the cybercrime reporting service, and his own bank The Cooperative Bank. But several weeks later, £5,760 was removed from his PayPal account.It turned out that the first buyer\u0027s bank had clawed back the payment for the 2014 Kubota compact tractor which had never been delivered. Banks can do this under so-called Chargeback rules for debit cards or Section 75 rules for credit cards.This plunged Neil thousands of pounds into debt. His PayPal and eBay account have been disabled until he repays the money, which he says he does not have. Neil has since discovered Sandberg\u0027s scam was linked to a larger police investigation into online fraud.In June, Money Mail revealed that nine major banks had allowed 82 accounts to be opened by a criminal gang using fake passports, driving licences and utility bills.Police found Sandberg\u0027s NatWest account among these and confirmed to Money Mail that Neil was a victim of crime. PayPal, however, is still demanding payment.Neil says: \u0027I told PayPal the fraudster owes them the money. I said the police were dealing with it. I shouldn\u0027t be liable for this debt.\u0027The bank should also take some responsibility. NatWest gave the criminal an account with fake documents. If I made this kind of error in my work, I\u0027d be hung, drawn and quartered.\u0027Arun Chauhan, director of Tenet Compliance \u0026amp Litigation, a law firm that advises on financial compliance, says a victim in Neil\u0027s position would need to prove in court that a bank failed in its money-laundering checks, which would be extremely difficult.Otherwise the company does not have to take responsibility for the missing money.NatWest has refused to help Neil clear the debt and says it meets \u0027strict regulations when opening an account for a new customer, including verifying customer ID and other details\u0027.A PayPal spokesman says it is working with Neil to \u0027find a way of helping him manage this debt\u0027 and has written off the PayPal fees associated with the original transaction as a goodwill gesture.

It is comfortably within the £325,000 inheritance tax allowance and will be split equally between Debbie and her brother.She says: \u0027My parents are ordinary, working-class people who trusted their bank. I am horrified NatWest could demand this money when they die.\u0027Barbara and Debbie are among dozens of readers who have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banks.Families have begun trawling through the small print of their contracts and say they have discovered huge charges they knew nothing about. Some described how they successfully begged for a reduction in the fees. One man managed to get the fee cut from £14,000 to £6,000 after challenging his parents\u0027 bank.          Dozens of readers  have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banksAnother family faced a £32,000 bill to administer their mother\u0027s estate, only for the bank to refuse to help when the will was challenged by a relative.Around the turn of the millennium, many major banks offered wills for as little as £75, or even at no upfront cost. They could afford to do this because they had loaded the terms and conditions with a catch that stated that the bank could appoint itself as executor of the will. That meant when the customer died, the bank could charge as much as 4.5per cent on the first £100,000 of the estate.Accountants say unless the estate is extremely complex, this can end up being hugely expensive. This is particularly true for modest estates that have benefited from soaring house prices.Jonathan Hoffman, an accountant who has advised on cases involving inheritance tax and wills since the Seventies, says: \u0027Banks should be charging an hourly fee based on how long it takes to deal with an estate.\u0027There is no reason why a simple case involving passing an estate between a husband and wife should be any more than ten hours of work. Even charged at £200 an hour this should amount to no more than £2,000.\u0027Some banks have reduced these fees in recent years — but they are still high. Lloyds, for example, charges 2.5per cent on the first £1 million of an estate. On a £500,000 estate this works out at £12,500.          When Sheena Hayes\u0027s aunt, Martha Mathers, died in 2008, Lloyds took £32,000 from her estate in charges for acting as an executor. Martha had died aged 81 without children, so left her estate - worth just under £1million - to eight nieces and nephews. Above, Sheena pictured with her familyNatWest charges 2.5per cent up to a maximum of £15,000 plus a £1,500 administration fee. A NatWest spokesman says: \u0027We offer upfront and transparent fees which are capped at a maximum amount. Where an estate is simple to administer we will look to offer a discount or, if appropriate, we will also offer the option for the bank to renounce. The bank is not automatically appointed as executor and customers are free to appoint a different executor at any time.\u0027The first Graham Penfold knew about these fees was when a smartly-dressed woman knocked on his mum\u0027s door a few days after his dad, Dennis, died 11 years ago. Graham and his wife Janice were staying at his family home in London to help his mum Margaret, then 79, plan the funeral and sort out his father\u0027s affairs.The woman said she had been sent by HSBC to discuss Dennis\u0027s will. Graham says she explained that the bank had been named as an executor and planned to charge £14,000 to administer the estate.          In the end, Graham and his family paid a total of £6,563 including VAT and legal advice fees for the will, with the breakdown of costs shown above. More than a decade later Graham, 66, says he still feel let down by the whole processA Lloyds Bank spokesman says it reimbursed the family for some of the solicitor\u0027s fees they incurred because of the challenging of the will.He says: \u0027We\u0027re sorry for Ms Hayes\u0027s loss of her aunt and the challenges she has had dealing with the estate. Family disputes, particularly involving larger estates, can be complex and occasionally result in additional legal issues which are not covered by standard fees. In this case, caveats were raised by family members which we tried to resolve with minimal legal costs. However, we were forced to seek specialist legal advice to resolve the situation.\u0027Another reader says her elderly friend\u0027s £310,000 estate was charged £16,000 by a bank to deal with matters after she died in 2008. This was on top of £4,406 paid to solicitors who handled the property sale.The reader also says she was told to contact the utility companies herself, along with sorting out other aspects of her friend\u0027s affairs.          From Money Mail\u0027s story last monthShe adds that she had no idea about the fees until she received the documents back from the bank around a year later. She says: \u0027At the time I just assumed that it was the typical charge for administering a will. But now I look back, I think that the bank did very little to earn such a huge fee.\u0027So if you\u0027ve discovered that your bank intends to charge you thousands of pounds to act as executor, what can you do?First, write to your bank and ask if it will stand down. Banks typically charge a fee of around £250 to remove their name as executor. However, if you live in England and Wales, it could refuse. (In Scotland they must agree to give up this responsibility when asked.)You can also try to negotiate to bring down the fees. If all else fails, tear it up and start again. In your new will, just include a line to clarify that it revokes all previous versions.If you opt for a professional writing service, choose the firm carefully will-writing is an unregulated business and there are rogue firms out there.Check that the company is signed up to an industry trade body, such as the Society of Will Writers or the Institute of Professional Will Writers. These enforce strict rules to which members must adhere. Solicitors are regulated by the Solicitors\u0027 Regulation Authority.You will likely be asked if you want to appoint the professional arranging your will as an executor. If your affairs are complicated, this could make sense. But check the fees. Beware if a firm tries to persuade you to appoint them as an executor. You may prefer to appoint a relative as an executor in the first place, particularly if your estate is relatively uncomplicated. If the executor needs legal help after you\u0027ve died, they can ask a probate broker such as Final Duties, which should provide a flat fee to deal with the estate.Even if your estate is more complex and you prefer a professional executor, then wherever possible try to include a relative as executor, too. They will understand your wishes better than a firm of solicitors.Most banks, including Zedra (which has taken over the Barclays probate business) and the Co-operative (which runs the former HSBC wills business), claim they will lower fees if an estate is very simple. NatWest says the same. So hold them to their word.Experts say as a rule of thumb that it should cost no more than £4,000 to administer a simple estate where no inheritance tax is due, savings are held in cash and there is a single property to be ided between your children.If an estate like this is being passed to your spouse, the fee should be even less. Higher charges may be justified if inheritance tax is due on the estate or if it includes stock market shares, which can take time to sell.If you or a loved one has already paid charges to the bank from the estate, you\u0027re unlikely to get your money back even if you believe the terms were unfair. However, it is still worth complaining to the bank. Lay out the fees and explain why you believe your loved one\u0027s estate was overcharged.If you do not get a satisfactory response, take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. You can make a complaint six years from the event or three years from the time that you knew (or could have reasonably known) you had cause to complain.Even if your loved one died long ago, it may be possible to argue that you realised that the fees were excessive only after reading about the issue in Money Mail this year. Good for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/09/4E543BE200000578-5961683-image-a-15_1531814453137.jpg","title":"Kim Jong blasts officials rare public criticism factory inspections focuses economics","story":"    An unhappy looking North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gives \u0027field guidance\u0027 during his visit to a machine factory under the Ranam Coal Mining Machine Complex          \u0027Now here\u0027s what you need to do\u0027: Kim Jong-un lays it on the line during his official visit to the Orangchon Power Station          No smiles here either, as the North Korea leader, who has traded his usual Mao-collared outfits for lighter looking attire, visits the Rajin salmon farmAfter officials briefed him about the project and its delays, he was \u0027 so appalled as to be left speechless\u0027 and \u0027extremely enraged,\u0027 the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.It was his second such rebuke over the economy in recent weeks.

This retrospective perfectly captures his unhurried pursuit of a now vanished Manhattan‘I simply looked at the world, not prepared for anything,” Saul Leiter said towards the end of his life. That sense of unhurriedness, coupled with a painterly eye for colour and composition, is palpable in his evocative colour photographs of New York. There is also an attentiveness that speaks of his disinterest in anything other than making the seemingly mundane world around him seem luminously beautiful.By the time he was “discovered” in 2006 with the publication of a book, Early Colour, he was 82. He had been working quietly for almost 60 years, first in monochrome, as a photojournalist, then in the 1950s, turning to colour to capture the rhythm and stillness of the same few streets around his Manhattan apartment in the soft, deep tones of Kodachrome slide film.Leiter’s late recognition brought him the kind of attention he had long avoided. In Tomas Leach’s thoughtful documentary, In No Great Hurry: 13 Life Lessons With Saul Leiter, he emerges as a reluctant object of attention. “What makes them think I’m any good?” he asks. In a sublime retrospective at the Foto Colectania gallery in Barcelona, there are 130 answers to that question, almost every one a testament to his singular talent. In Search of Beauty, which is currently drawing hushed and reverent crowds to the newly relocated gallery in Passeig Picasso, is a well-nigh perfect overview of Leiter’s career. In many ways, it is the perfect space for his deeply crafted images: the gallery is in a converted saddler’s that retains an artisanal atmosphere, with its wood-panelled offices and library enclosing a simple square space.Curator Roger Szmulewicz has wisely chosen to lead with Leiter’s signature colour photographs of Manhattan. Arranged in a single line around the perimeter, each one is a study in form, colour and atmosphere. This is not the overcrowded, fast-paced New York later caught by the likes of Garry Winogrand or Joel Meyerowitz. Instead, what Leiter captures, and heightens, is the atmosphere of another, older Manhattan – an almost sedate place, sometimes suffused with warm summer light, sometimes blanketed by falling snow.Often he shoots through steamed windows or catches a passing reflection. His subjects are stilled in a moment of reverie, waiting at traffic lights or daydreaming in a stalled vehicle. Sometimes he shot at night or at twilight, just as the light was fading, so that people appear as ghostly silhouettes against the deep reds and greens of advertising billboards and neon shop signs. He isolates lone human figures in stark relief against snow or rain. Umbrellas are a recurring motif, their circular geometry irresistibly drawing the eye, like a splash of red or orange in an impressionist painting. He was constantly alert, too, to the typographical poetry of street signs and lettering stencilled on shop windows. It all adds up to an intimate portrait of a time, a place and its passing people.The son of an Orthodox rabbi who fled the constrictions of a traditional Jewish upbringing in Pittsburgh to try to become an artist in mid-1940s New York, Leiter never lost his painter’s eye for colour and composition. Some of his images approach the purely abstract: shadows against blurred orange lights a dark silhouette just identifiable against a blur of passing cars people and things partially obscured by shadowy objects in the foreground. The result is a strange hybrid of intimate observation and heightened atmosphere, the creation of a New York that is familiar and slightly unreal in the way that certain paintings of the city are unreal – Edward Hopper’s work springs to mind. Leiter was a photographer possessed of a painter’s sensibility. He even made a series of painted nudes, applying paint on top of his photographic portraits to often vibrant effect.It is hardly surprising then, that in the earlier black and white work, New York seems like another city – more ghostly and gritty, less dreamlike. Here, too, Leiter plays with form, homing in on silhouettes, catching shafts of geometric light as they fall on faces and torsos. To some degree, that painter’s eye informs every photograph. Even more revelatory are the series of recently discovered intimate portraits, many of them collected in the new Steidl photo book, In My Room. In the 1950s and into the early 60s, Leiter photographed the women he knew – including his longtime partner-muse, Soames Bantry, and several of her model friends – mostly in his New York studio.The portraits, in grainy black and white, are certainly erotic, but in an almost languorous way. He captures his subjects in motion or in repose, sometimes seemingly unaware of his gaze, sometimes returning it with a provocative or accepting look. The few full nudes are the most abstract images, shadows falling on skin, the prints grainy and high contrast. Again, many of the images were taken through doors or screens, giving the sense of glimpsed intimate snapshots – except his compositional skill is so consistently finely honed as to make the term seem almost insulting. There is a relaxed intimacy to them that speaks of thoughtful collaboration between photographer and subject.After such richness, the single wall of Leiter’s colour fashion photography seems almost superfluous. One can see he was too singular an artist to be at ease in such a commercial sphere, yet he succeeds in making portraits that, as he put it later, looked “like a photograph rather than a fashion photograph”. More interesting still is the small collection of ephemera, in the wood-panelled library next door, that includes family snapshots, a sketchbook and palette knives.Half a dozen quotes by Leiter are stencilled on the walls of the gallery. One reads: “There is a tremendous advantage of being unimportant.” Another reads: “In some secret place in my being was a desire to avoid success.” Both give you some idea of Leiter’s temperament and the ways it informed the unhurried pursuit of his art. The almost devotional hush in the gallery as people peer at these images is testimony to a life devoted to the quiet pursuit of a singular vision and the avoidance of such distractions as fame or even recognition. For Leiter, simply looking at the world was enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da233e9012e20fe143ebe53bb1d95c1efa7330b/0_122_2321_1392/master/2321.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bb7886c661e6393865bc8f1f12c672","title":"kylie jenner myth early success","story":"While the 20-year-old may soon be worth $1bn thanks to her cosmetics empire, the fetishisation of youthful entrepreneurs masks the lack of opportunity for most millennialsAs the world edges ever closer to apocalypse, it is important to take time out from the unrelenting hellscape that is the news to celebrate the occasional feelgood story. So, please have your handkerchiefs at the ready for the moving tale of a young woman who, against all odds, stared down adversity and achieved the sort of success of which a mere mortal could only dream.I speak of Kylie Jenner. Forbes estimated last week that the 20-year-old, who parlayed her reality TV show fame into a lucrative cosmetics empire, is worth $900m (£680m) and is on track to unseat Mark Zuckerberg as the “youngest self-made billionaire” in history.The Forbes article prompted a debate, mostly among losers lazy enough not to have been born into a megarich family, about what “self-made” means. We don’t need to rehash that debate, because we all have access to a dictionary. It is obvious that anyone with the wherewithal to plaster their famous name on lip kits, instead of frivolously squandering their familial fortune, is “self-made”. But enough snark about semantics. I want to talk about the cult of early success that has framed the conversation around Jenner’s fortune. Thanks to the pace of technological change, experience is no longer equated with age and a cultural expectation seems to have been set that bright young things should succeed from the get-go. As Forbes put it in the introduction to its 2014 30 Under 30 list: “Never before has youth been such an advantage. These founders and funders … aren’t waiting for a proper bump up the career ladder. Their goals are way bigger – and perfectly suited to the dynamic, entrepreneurial and impatient digital world they grew up in.”While it is great that our impatient digital world has lowered the age barrier to success, it has also perpetuated unreasonable expectations. Increasingly, if you have not “made it” by 30, you are seen as being over the hill. Forget getting funding for your startup idea, for example. “The cutoff in investors’ heads is 32,” said Paul Graham, a prominent venture capitalist,in a 2013 New York Times interview. “After 32, they start to be a little sceptical.” Which is only reasonable. As a fresh-faced Zuckerberg told an audience at a 2007 tech event, “young people are just smarter”.The problem with the myth of the entrepreneurial wunderkind is that it is, well, a myth. Experience and time (plus inherited wealth and luck) are still important factors in success. Earlier this year, researchers from MIT, Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and the US Census Bureau analysed data from companies started between 2007 and 2015. They found that the average age of people who founded the best-performing startups was 45. “If you had two identical ideas, one proposed by a very young person, one proposed by a middle-aged person, and that’s the only thing you have to go on, you would be better off – if you wanted to predict success – betting on a middle-aged person,” one of the lead researchers said.Another problem with fetishising early success is that amplifying super-successful young outliers helps gloss over the inconvenient fact that most millennials are far worse off than the generation before them. Insecure jobs, low wages and unaffordable housing mean it is increasingly difficult for your hard work to pay off, no matter how enterprising you are. Unless, of course, you are Kylie Jenner.WeWork, one of the world’s most valuable startups, has given meat the chop. Last week, the office-space provider informed its 6,000 employees that they will no longer be able to expense meals that include poultry, pork or red meat. There also won’t be any meat at staff events paid for by the company.The company’s co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, explained in an email to employees that this decision was being made for the greater good. “New research indicates that avoiding meat is one of the biggest things an inidual can do to reduce their personal environmental impact.” WeWork claims the policy will save 16.7bn gallons of water and 15.5m animals by 2023.WeWork is not the first company to try to enforce a meat-free environment. The founder of Juicero, the startup that went bust last year after its $699 wifi juice machine failed to catch on, allegedly chastised employees who had milk in their coffee (which he referred to as “cow pus”). Former employees have said that sometimes he did not allow them to expense work meals at non-vegan restaurants.Not everyone agrees with WeWork’s decision. The TUC criticised the new policy, saying that, while employees should be encouraged to make healthy choices, “they should not be left out of pocket if they choose to eat meat”. I think this is right. Nevertheless, large employers should be doing more to reduce meat consumption. Companies would do well to commit to increasing the number of vegetarian options at their events and in their cafeterias and reducing the amount of meat on the menu. Environmentally speaking, this would do a lot more good than our current obsession with banning straws.Let it be said that I never pass up a good opportunity for procrastination – even if needles are involved. Last week, the co-working space from which I occasionally work was, for some reason, offering vitamin B12 injections. I immediately signed myself up. I have, you see, the trifecta of characteristics that mark out B12-deficient people: I am lazy, a vegetarian and a hypochondriac. I reckoned a $30 injection would be an easier way of getting a burst of energy than tedious things such as diet and exercise. Reader, I was wrong. All I got from being stabbed in the arm with a needle was a small puncture wound."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baae4148a9a3dd4bb0d55dfd1209dcf4a8e51e58/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77baa878fe62b24d9e1d9245fe8d8e83","title":"ministers vote leave sacked electoral commission brexit undemocratic","story":"Those who persuaded the British people to vote for Brexit have now given up on a glorious future for global Britain. These arguments lie in tatters, buried beneath the government’s own studies into the impacts of Brexit showing it will be disastrous for the economy under any scenario. Instead, they are resorting to the “will of the people” mantra. Take Priti Patel’s recent tweet in which she says: “This is no longer an argument about whether Brexit was a good idea but is about democracy \u0026amp standing by the democratic decision made by the people.” In other words, no matter how bad the consequences for all of us, we have to go ahead with Brexit because democracy demands it.But upholding democracy is a selective affair for Brexiteers. The leave campaign has wasted no time in engaging in some mudslinging at the Electoral Commission, the body responsible for regulating our democracy. The commission’s investigation into Vote Leave found the campaign group broke the law by coordinating with sister campaign, BeLeave. Vote Leave has been fined £61,000 and both campaigns have been referred to the police. Yet the response from Vote Leave officials is to accuse the Electoral Commission of “false accusations” and being motivated by a political agenda, “unfounded claims and conspiracy theories”. It is worth reminding ourselves at this point that a host of senior government ministers sat on the Vote Leave campaign committee. These included Liam Fox, Iain Duncan Smith, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Steve Baker and Chris Grayling, as well as the defender of democracy herself, Priti Patel.It is also worth noting the strong overlap between Vote Leave members and the odious European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, that is currently holding Theresa May hostage over her Brexit plans. In spite of the shocking weakness of our constitution that Brexit has exposed, we need the prime minister to demonstrate her stalwart defence of the rule of law by sacking cabinet ministers who were on the Vote Leave committee, namely Fox, Gove, Grayling and Raab. She should also recall that we are signatories to the Venice commission which states that campaign overspending is adequate grounds for annulling an election result. The foundations of our democratic systems are being undermined and it is May’s duty to defend them.Of course, today’s news of Vote Leave breaching electoral law is just the latest in a series of scandals to dog the leave campaigns. Leave.EU, the campaign supported by Nigel Farage and funded by Arron Banks, has also been found to have breached electoral law and fined. Its chief executive has been referred to the police. And then of course there is the whole question of micro-targeting and psychological manipulation techniques and the scandals around AIQ and Cambridge Analytica and the ways in which they were linked to the leave campaigns. The democratic mandate for Brexit has been undermined.Even if this mandate were strong and stable there would still be reason to question whether we press ahead with Brexit when so much has changed both within our country and across the world. Not least, a US president who is so easily manipulated at the hands of authoritarian tyrants. His failure to denounce Russian meddling in the US presidential election sets him against American law enforcers, defence officials and intelligence agencies, all of whom believe that Russia did interfere in the 2016 presidential elections. There is also the fact that Brexit serves Trump’s agenda of destabilising both UK and US democracies and Putin’s agenda of undermining the EU, which is why there are substantiated claims of Russian interference in the referendum campaign.So there are good grounds for considering the vote to leave the EU now lacks legitimacy. It is quite clear that the mandate for Brexit lies buried beneath countless occurrences of cheating, voter manipulation and electoral law-breaking.It is rare I would quote David Davis on anything, but on democracy he is spot on: “If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.” This helps explain the growing chorus from all shades of the political spectrum for a people’s vote. The idea is also proving increasingly popular with the public.The Brexiteers are using arguments about democracy to try and force through something that will have profoundly negative impacts on the UK economy, society and the environment for generations to come.

Her 90th birthday speech is broadcast on Beyoncé’s Lemonade (you’ll know the bit even if you haven’t ever listened to the album). “I was served lemons,” she says, “but I made lemonade.”Two years on from those immortal words #whenlifegivesyoulemons has been used more than 160,000 times on Instagram, and spawned a thousand memes. The lemon emoji, meanwhile, has almost three million hashtags. Beyoncé was – as ever – early on the trend. Keen to make her album a 360 experience, fans could buy a baseball cap with a lemon on it for her 2017 tour, and it’s still available online. The lemon has since blossomed. Forget florals or palm fronds, fruits are the print to wear in 2018, and lemons are the pick of the bunch.You’ll find them on swimsuits at Matchesfashion and dresses at Asos. Lemon earrings are a thing at Accessorize, Jacquemus and boutique brands including Wolf \u0026amp Moon. They add zing to any outfit (they will also start conversations, so be warned – don’t wear if you are not keen for a chat at the bus stop). Lemons on T-shirts work, too – Ganni’s Murphy, which features a lemon, was an influencer favourite. It is sold out but you can find similar versions at Topshop and Missguided (FYI early adopters: Ganni has moved on to the banana). Celebrities have also taken to impersonating the fruit – the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex have worn shift dresses the colour of limoncello over the past week, a confident hit of serotonin for public engagements.If summer 2017 was tropical – pineapples and palms – this year has shifted. The alpha lemon to have printed on your dress – or artfully arranged on a bleached wood table on your social media post – is the Sorrento lemon, native to Italy. It hails from the Amalfi Coast, and comes unwaxed with organic-looking nobbles and bobbles and, ideally, a couple of leaves still attached (smooth GM-style fruits aren’t really reading the room).There’s a sort of timeless, universal appeal to the lemon print in the summer, one that feels instant, friendly and inclusive rather than in-the-know like, say, slogan or band T-shirts. They have been an everyday motif in art for centuries – in paintings from 17th-century Dutch still lives, to Picasso’s abstractions in the 1930s, Roy Lichtenstein’s pop lemons and even the 1989 Stone Roses album, a John Squire take on a Jackson Pollock.It makes sense, perhaps, that when it comes to designers, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana really own the lemon trend. They are geographically closest to the Amalfi Coast, after all. The Italian duo produced a collection based on the mercato ortofrutticolo – that’s Italian for farmer’s market, but you knew that – including tomatoes, courgette flowers and chillies in 2012. Lemons have emerged as a favourite though. A whole collection appeared in 2016. Last year, they released a jewellery campaign shot in a lemon orchard. As with most things with the Italian label, the vibes here are sex kitten off-duty – Sophia Loren cooking up spaghetti al limone, or Brigitte Bardot visiting Picasso at his studio in 1956.

Hedges received an Oscar nomination for his breakout performance in Manchester by the Sea and has since appeared in Lady Bird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. His onscreen parents in the film are played by Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman.Edgerton, most recently seen opposite Jennifer Lawrence in Red Sparrow, also appears in front of the camera as the head of the program.“I’m obsessed with cults and prisons, and I felt like I was going to get this glimpse into a world I’d heard about,” Edgerton said of the film earlier this year. “You leave Garrard’s story feeling like the true conversion that is at the heart of the movie is the conversion of his ideas.”It’s the second film this year to tackle the issue of gay conversion therapy, following on from Appropriate Behaviour director Desiree Akhavan’s comedy drama The Miseducation of Cameron Post, which won the Grand Jury prize at January’s Sundance film festival.Boy Erased is released in US cinemas on 2 November and is expected to premiere at the fall festival circuit, with an Oscar campaign likely to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67220c682c272c1baa8a1b448efc5a5eafdaf152/664_767_1803_1082/master/1803.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be23e1371b7f4fb96a550e17fb0461fe","title":"spectator retracts harvey weinstein confession interview","story":"Interviewer says he may have misrepresented conversation with movie producerThe Spectator has formally retracted quotes it attributed to Harvey Weinstein, in which the disgraced former film mogul allegedly admitted to offering acting jobs in exchange for sex, in addition to deleting an unrelated description of Weinstein attempting to hit on women at a Christmas party.The interview, by regular columnist and friend of Weinstein’s Taki Theodoracopulos, was live for several days after it was called into question after its publication on Friday. In the piece, the film producer responded to multiple accusations of sexual assault that could result in him being sent to prison.The piece ran with the headline: “Harvey Weinstein: ‘I offered acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so does everyone – they still do’” and the subheading: “The disgraced movie producer reached out to Taki with a ‘world exclusive’ about Rose McGowan and Asia Argento”, making reference to two of the film producer’s accusers. The magazine stated that Weinstein complained he had been born “poor, ugly, Jewish and had to fight all my life to get somewhere”. “You got lotsa girls, no girl looked at me until I made it big in Hollywood,” the original Spectator piece quoted him as telling Theodoracopulos. “Yes, I did offer them acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so did and still does everyone. But I never, ever forced myself on a single woman.”The claims that Weinstein had admitted he exchanged employment for sex were widely reported around the world but were soon denied by the film producer’s personal lawyer, who claimed he was present for the interview.Theodoracopulos soon said he may have misinterpreted Weinstein but the piece initially remained unchanged over the weekend, prompting doubt over whether the magazine stood by the reporting. However, it has now been updated to carry the headline: “My chat with Harvey Weinstein”, the most controversial quotes have been deleted, and it carries an “update” from the author.“A section of this article, in which I may have misrepresented Harvey’s conversation with me in New York last month, has been removed,” said Theodoracopulos in the revised version. “It was my mistake. We were discussing Hollywood and I may have misunderstood certain things about the methods of that place. I hope I have not damaged his case.”Theodoracopulos did not only remove quotes from Weinstein but also deleted a supplementary paragraph discussing the film producer’s approach to women: “I’ve seen Harvey in action during my annual Christmas party, the one I throw every year in New York with Michael Mailer. He hits on every young woman but in a naive way. ‘Will you give me your address and I’ll make you a star,’ is the theme of the pickup. Some say yes, some say no. His reaction was always the same. Smile and laugh and hit on the next one.”It is unclear how Theodoracopulos misquoted Weinstein or why the separate commentary on the producer’s behaviour at Christmas parties was also deleted, since it was not relating to the recent interview with him.Tweets and URLs relating to the original version of the piece have since been deleted or redirected.Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator, declined to comment on the retraction, citing the fact his magazine preferred to let its columnists speak for themselves and pointing out that the interview had been posted as a blog on the magazine’s US website. Theodoracopulos, 81, is the offspring of a Greek shipping tycoon and has written the Spectator’s “High Life” column for more than four decades, regularly attracting controversy for his extreme rightwing views. In May, one of his columns regarding the army of Nazi Germany was published under the headline: “In praise of the Wehrmacht”. It was swiftly changed to “The other side of D-Day”. He has also written in defence of the violent neo-fascist Greek party Golden Dawn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841e361bc1b22733151b3dd0be5f8c2cbb46caac/1_0_5507_3306/master/5507.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f23ba47bc80b401a19c07a26a3f81e2a","title":"the world cup colour chart a photographic journey","story":"Looking back at the highs and lows of Russia 2018 via a rainbow of imagery, from Gareth Southgate to France lifting the trophy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a5456f684d9442293a3c38504e7136f9e8b68c3/0_278_4997_2998/master/4997.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e11a85ac768a5169635627dc2041fbd2","title":"wembley stadium sale plans fa sport england grassroots","story":"• Sport England expresses conditional support• World Cup strengthens FA’s resolve to sellThe Football Association’s proposed sale of Wembley stadium has become more likely to gain the necessary approvals of public bodies after the grant-giving agency Sport England expressed conditional support. In written evidence submitted to the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee before a hearing on Wednesday about the Wembley sale, Sport England stated that it sees benefits in the FA’s plan to invest the projected £600m proceeds in grassroots facilities, as long as Wembley’s sporting status is protected.Sport England suggests that if the necessary safeguards are in place it will give consent and provide grants to boost the FA’s investment. “Provided appropriate protections can be agreed it appears that there is an opportunity to coinvest new funds strategically, for the benefit of football, and the wider community, at the grassroots or community level,” it states.The original funding agreement stipulated that the new Wembley had to remain a national home of sport, with priority given to sporting events rather than concerts and other entertainment which could make money for the stadium. A list of sporting “flagship events” which have to be given precedence was incorporated into the agreement which, Sport England emphasises in its submission to the committee, will have to remain protected “as far as practicable”.The flagship events include England men’s and women’s football internationals, FA Cup semi-finals and the men’s and women’s FA Cup final, the FA Vase and Trophy finals and Community Shield, the EFL and National League play-off finals, the EFL Cup and trophy finals and the rugby league Challenge Cup final.Consent to a sale is also required from the Greater London Authority, whose predecessor the London Development Agency awarded a £21m grant towards the Wembley project, and from the government. The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, is due to give evidence to the committee.The England team’s surprising advance to the World Cup semi-final, and the widespread admiration for the way the team played and was managed by Gareth Southgate, has strengthened the FA’s resolve to sell Wembley. The FA set out in detail the generally poor quality of publicly owned football facilities across England, which have suffered severely from the Conservative government’s budget cuts to local authorities.The FA’s surveys have found that only one in three pitches in England is “of adequate quality” and that poor facilities are always “the number one issue” for grassroots clubs and players. From the £600m gross proceeds of selling Wembley, the FA is pledging that more than £2bn would be invested over the next 20 years, to support the national strategy for improving facilities and also increase the numbers of players, coaches, referees, volunteers and administrators.“A significant increase in investment in football at the community level … could bring significant benefits to people and communities across England,” it states, “reaching some of the most under-represented groups in sport and physical activity as a whole.”Sport England’s consent to a sale of Wembley will also be conditional on being satisfied that Khan or any other buyer, and any subsequent buyer, is “an appropriate person to own the national stadium” and has a sound business plan. The consultants Grant Thornton have been appointed to assess the purchase. The London borough of Brent wants any new owner to be committed to the ongoing regeneration of the area around Wembley.The DCMS committee will also hear evidence from the TV analyst and former England full-back Gary Neville, and Katrina Law, co-chair of the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b2b815a4553d4a833376bb8c177aa9115ebe96/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cf034f54334cee7e042be90f5c3204","title":"the french national football teams victory parade in pictures","story":"France celebrated their second World Cup win on 15 July, 20 years after their maiden triumph.

At the same time, the number of subscribers to pay-TV packages reached 15.1 million, according to a report published by media regulator Ofcom.The milestone marks a major competitive shift in the TV industry as the rise of the global internet firms and changing viewing habits, especially among younger viewers, is putting increasing pressure on the UK’s traditional pay-TV and free-to-air broadcasters including BBC, ITV and Channel 4.The Ofcom report found that the total pay-TV revenues of Sky, Virgin, BT and TalkTalk fell for the first time in the almost a decade in 2017 to £6.4bn. Growth has been explosive: in 2012, the year Netflix launched in the UK, subscription on-demand revenues were just £52m.The report pointed out that the rise of co-productions, often with companies including Netflix and Amazon, had gone some way to bridging the fall in spending.Ofcom highlighted the growing trend among those aged 16 to 34 to skip the traditional pastime of watching scheduled broadcast TV. The majority of viewing by this group is non-broadcast content, which includes watching streaming services, catch-up and on-demand TV. YouTube makes up the highest proportion of non-broadcast viewing in the age group.“The research finds that what we watch and how we watch it are changing rapidly, which has profound implications for UK television,” said Sharon White, the chief executive of Ofcom. “We have seen a decline in revenues for pay-TV a fall in spending on new programmes by our public service broadcasters and the growth of global video streaming giants. These challenges cannot be overestimated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e28222bd17a971c93d5c0d326a4b74992eeb5c5c/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27e76afaa3a7e28b8f5a498ae7cfbfef 480w","title":"bullied mps just lie back and think of saving theresa may","story":"Deep down, prime minister must wish someone would press her control-alt-delete keys to crash her entirelyWith the government having reluctantly come to the conclusion that it was probably a better look to hang around and go through the motions of doing a bit of work rather than bunk off on hols a few days early while the country fell apart, the Commons eventually got round to debating the third reading of the trade bill. Though not for very long, obviously. After all, it wasn’t as if it contained anything of great importance. It was only Brexit. Ken Clarke kicked things off with a point of order complaining about the limited amount of time the government had allocated to such significant legislation. Anyone would think it didn’t want parliament to have much of a say. Ministers on the front bench nodded enthusiastically. It was all terribly complicated and they didn’t want to detain anyone for any longer than necessary so close to their hols. MPs should just lie back and think of saving Theresa May. For a while, as the less contentious amendments to the bill were debated, everyone appeared to do just that. Opening for the government, the junior trade minister, George Hollingbery, spent a long time confusing himself and everyone else by insisting that future trade arrangements would be both identical to how they were now and completely different. He seemed to be making a bid to become the idiot’s idiot. A hotly contested title in the Tory party at the moment.  It wasn’t until much later in the afternoon that MPs got to the debate proper. For all of half an hour. This was Conservative Phillip Lee’s amendment to remain in the European Medicine Partnership and Stephen Hammond’s to keep the UK in a customs union if the government had failed to reach a trade deal with the EU by 21 January next year. Both were at pains to point out that these were entirely consistent with the prime minister’s Chequers’ white paper. Their problem was that the government now only appears to accept amendments that directly contradict its own policies. While Hammond spelled out the dangers to jobs and business of a no-deal Brexit, the chief whip, Julian Smith, passed Hollingbery a piece of paper. The minister then intervened. It was like this. If Hammond was to forget about his amendment, he would promise to put forward a different amendment in the House of Lords saying that he had given the rebel proposals even greater thought before deciding to ignore them. Trust me, I’m a liar. “That’s a generous offer,” said Hammond. One that he wasn’t tempted to accept. Having been palmed off with snake oil over the meaningful vote, he wasn’t going to fall for the same trick twice. Once bitten twice shy. His counter offer for the government to accept his new clause 18 and then to amend it in the Lords was also refused. Stalemate.  Theresa is now so in hock to the hardline Brexiters of the European Reform Group that she can barely get out of bed without their permission. It’s painful to watch. Deep down she must wish someone would press her control-alt-delete keys to crash her entirely. Without authority. Without self worth. Without a plan. Without. Oblivion must be preferable. As the government whips visibly bullied their way round the chamber – so much for plans to crack down on abuse in parliament – a few of the rebels held firm. Lee declared that the previous day, when the government had ripped up its own white paper to accommodate a small cabal of Brexiters, had been his worst as a parliamentarian. There must have been stiff competition, as only a few weeks ago he had resigned as a minister only to abstain on a rebellion. Nicky Morgan insisted it was time to think of the national interest. Most Tories appeared horrified by the suggestion. Then came the votes. The government lost on the Lee amendment, but squeaked home on Hammond’s, the one that really mattered. The Tory benches went loudly berserk when the result was announced. Finding you’ve still got a job for at least another day can do that to people. When push came to shove not enough Tory rebels had been prepared to rebel. The bullied had sold their souls to save a leader whom they knew was useless and planned to get rid of anyway at some point in the near future.  Even then the government could have been defeated but for four Labour MPs who voted against the amendment. Step forward Kate Hoey, Graham Stringer, Frank Field and John Mann. Or Baroness Kate, Sir Graham, Sir Frank and Sir John as they will surely become when the prime minister next gets round to compiling an honours list. She owes them big time. These four had a chance to put a Labour government close to power and thought better of it. They must be very proud of themselves.

Two people have been referred to the police. But with this initial investigation concluded, Britain faces a difficult period of soul searching over what to do about this evidence of extensive wrongdoing.A democracy is only as strong as the elections that set its course. If they can be bought or subverted, then confidence in democracy and the legitimacy of the governments it installs, seeps away.But astonishingly, the details that have been gradually revealed, of illegal activity by both the official Vote Leave and the unofficial Leave.EU campaigns in the run-up to the Brexit vote, appear to have no immediate consequences.Most British elections are guaranteed by law. If evidence of serious cheating is uncovered they can be scrutinised and overturned in an “election court”, overseen by high court judges. However, because the Brexit referendum was only an advisory vote there are no legal channels to challenge the result. Only parliament can investigate the result, declare it void or demand a re-run.Nor have the powerful politicians who fronted the flawed Vote Leave campaign faced direct censure, even as the country is rocked by the tumultuous fallout from a vote that is now known to be flawed.The Electoral Commission’s report established that BeLeave was operating as an arm of Vote Leave, which had won official status and the taxpayer money that entailed, partly by recruiting Conservative party luminaries. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, was co-chair and the former foreign minister Boris Johnson was a figurehead for the campaign. But the report names only Darren Grimes, an inexperienced student at the time of the poll, and the previously obscure Vote Leave official David Halsall.Both Gove and Johnson had once been quick to dismiss critics of the Vote Leave campaign. In March Johnson described the Observer’s report on the campaign group’s coordination with BeLeave as “ludicrous” and said Vote Leave won “fair and square”. Yet both men have been conspicuously silent since the Election Commission report was released – along with other senior government or Conservative figures who sat on the Vote Leave committee. These include Liam Fox, Iain Duncan Smith, the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, and the former international development secretary Priti Patel.It is unclear whether the British media will try to hold Gove, Johnson and other senior Vote Leave figures to account over the cheating where the Electoral Commission was not able to do so. The record so far has not been encouraging.Editors at the BBC must be questioning – or should now be questioning – why they gave the Vote Leave CEO, Matthew Elliott, virtually free rein to attack the watchdog and present his version of the report days before its official release. His account differed significantly from the published report.Too often over the two years since the referendum any efforts to question or investigate the Brexit campaigns have been dismissed as undemocratic sabotage, the work of bitter losers.In fact, exposing fraud is a profoundly democratic enterprise, an act of commitment to ensuring that votes are respected. And yet journalists, lawyers and researchers digging into these questions began with very little political support. The Electoral Commission’s findings on Vote Leave – after it was forced to reopen an investigation that previously cleared the campaign group – have been a vindication of their work.Yet this was only one fight, over one aspect of a campaign still shadowed by other serious questions about the legality of campaigns and funding, and several ongoing investigations. The original source of more than £400,000 donated to the Democratic Unionist party’s Brexit campaign remains obscure, and the government has fought efforts to uncover details about the cash, officially provided by a small thinktank.The Electoral Commission has been looking into whether the Brexit donor Arron Banks’s Better for the Country was the “true source of donations” to the leave campaigns. The Sunday Times has also reported that the National Crime Agency has been investigating Banks’s alleged Russian links. Separately, the Information Commissioner’s Office is conducting an inquiry into potential data sharing between groups, including Brexit campaigns. The politan police have an inquiry into Liz Bilney, the CEO of Leave.EU, after the Electoral Commission ruled that Banks’s campaign had exceeded its spending limits.The Electoral Commission has also put out an urgent plea for stronger laws and greater resources to protect British democracy.Only months before the UK is due to leave the EU, with huge political and economic upheaval, it is reasonable to expect that part of the response to this report must focus on whether the decision to do so was legitimate.Yet, in some ways, to argue about whether illegal spending by Vote Leave, Leave.EU – or possibly others – was enough to swing this hard-fought referendum is to sidestep more profound concerns about the implications of those actions.The people who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign currently face little more than a rap over the knuckles for cheating. But their actions have been described by Gavin Millar QC as being of a “scale and seriousness” not known in the modern era, and which has potentially reshaped Britain’s future.The barrister and election expert Adam Wagner spelled it out: “What is the point of having strict rules over elections and referendums if there are no consequences for them being broken?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43e10c4a6743736fb96963afcfb3e94db699d577/165_207_817_490/master/817.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ebc7af8f453c9f0163c522a1f24039d","title":"astronomers discover 12 new moons orbiting jupiter","story":"A head-on collision between two Jovian moons would create a crash so large it would be visible from earthOne of a dozen new moons discovered around Jupiter is circling the planet on a suicide orbit that will inevitably lead to its violent destruction, astronomers say.Researchers in the US stumbled upon the new moons while hunting for a mysterious ninth planet that is postulated to lurk far beyond the orbit of Neptune, the most distant planet in the solar system.The team first glimpsed the moons in March last year from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, but needed more than a year to confirm that the bodies were locked in orbit around the gas giant. “It was a long process,” said Scott Sheppard, who led the effort at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC.Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, was hardly short of moons before the latest findings. The fresh haul of natural satellites brings the total number of Jovian moons to 79, more than are known to circle any other planet in our cosmic neighbourhood.Nine of the new moons belong to an outer group that orbit Jupiter in retrograde, meaning they travel in the opposite direction to the planet’s spin. They are thought to be the remnants of larger parent bodies that were broken apart in collisions with asteroids, comets and other moons. Each takes about two years to circle the planet.Two more of the moons are in a group that circle much closer to the planet in prograde orbits which travel in the same direction as Jupiter’s spin. Most likely to be pieces of a once larger moon that was broken up in orbit, they take nearly a year to complete a lap around Jupiter. Which direction the moons swing around the planet depends on how they were first captured by Jupiter’s gravitational field.Astronomers describe the twelfth new Jovian moon as an “oddball”. Less than a kilometre wide, the tiny body circles Jupiter on a prograde orbit but at a distance that means it crosses the path of other moons hurtling towards it. Scientists have named the new moon Valetudo after the Roman god Jupiter’s great-granddaughter, the goddess of health and hygiene. But given the impending violence, it may be more than coincidence that Vale Tudo, which translates from Portuguese as “anything goes”, is an early form of full-contact mixed martial arts. “Valetudo is like driving down the highway on the wrong side of the road,” said Sheppard. “It is moving prograde while all the other objects at a similar distance from Jupiter are moving retrograde. Thus head-on collisions are likely.”Sheppard, whose report appears in the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Electronic Circular, suspects that Valetudo is the final remnant of a once much larger moon that has been ground to dust by collisions in the past. Which raises the question of how long the tiny moon has left. “Collisions don’t happen all that frequently, every billion years or so,” said Sheppard. “If one did happen, we would be able to detect it from Earth, but it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eefeb997b8b82b1d28e1e6ca545a6dd4edce534/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78adb1c26bc633fa6eb0e27f52c58720","title":"disability claimants owed 340m after dwp blunder say mps","story":"‘Indifferent’ department tried to shift the blame and took six years to correct errorA cross-party group of MPs has criticised the Department for Work and Pensions’ “culture of indifference” after it took six years to correct a major error which left chronically-ill and disabled benefit claimants thousands of pounds out of pocket.An estimated 70,000 claimants were underpaid by between £5,000 and £20,000 between 2011 and 2016 because the DWP failed to ensure they received the correct amounts when moving them from incapacity benefit on to the employment and support allowance (ESA).The cost of fixing the error, which a public accounts committee’s (PAC) report said stemmed from a string of avoidable management failures, will cost the DWP at least £340m in back payments to claimants and £14m in administrative costs.As well as losing out on thousands of pounds through underpayments, the DWP’s failure to check claimants’ entitlements meant some were also denied their rights to help with dentistry costs, as well as free school meals and free medical prescriptions.The report criticised the DWP for rushing into the transfer without taking legal advice or making basic checks, brushing aside evidence that people were being underpaid, and ignoring warnings from its own policy advisors that it should pause and fix the process before proceeding.Even after it became formally aware of its error in 2014, the department failed to act, initially attempting to pass the mistake off as being the fault of claimants. After years of “inertia” it began to put in place a repayment plan in 2017, and then only after receiving advice that it had a legal responsibility to act. The report concluded the DWP’s lack of urgency in taking six years to start to address the error indicated “a culture of indifference” towards people being underpaid.Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the PAC, said the episode pointed to “weakness at the highest levels” of DWP management: “Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA.”The ESA failure was overseen by the Tory former secretary of state for work and pensions Iain Duncan Smith, who was in post for all but the last few months of the period covered by the report. The current secretary of state, Esther McVey, was a DWP minister between 2013 and 2015.Although it accepted it had got the process wrong and apologised, the DWP has insisted it will not pay compensation to affected claimants, and will limit back payments to 2014, a cut-off point which would deny claimants up to £150m in lost benefits. That decision is being challenged through the courts.The report argued the DWP should pay compensation to claimants, as well as back payments. “There is clearly much more to be done to right this wrong,” it stated.The department told MPs it accepted it should better understand its legal obligations. The report drily noted: “Our view is that this continues to underplay its moral obligation to act promptly and comprehensively to make good its mistakes when they occur.”The report said the DWP must learn from the mistakes it made during the ESA transfer in order to not repeat them when its starts a major programme of transferring 3 million claimants from existing benefits onto universal credit from July 2019. Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits (including unemployment and benefits, and tax credits) into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbsp means it is six years behind schedule and rollout will not be complete until 2023.The original design set out\u0026nbsp a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.It added the department must act urgently to “address a management culture which does not proactively and systematically act on intelligence from its frontline and fully address mistakes when they first occurred”.The national association of welfare rights advisers wrote to the the DWP in 2014 to alert them to what its frontline advisors had realised was a “systematic” error. It told MPs the DWP could be “unconstructive” when confronted with legitimate concerns by outside organisations. The DWPs “abysmal” communications with claimants exacerbated the scale and impact of the error, the report noted. Letters to claimants were often “incomprehensible,” and the department’s most senior official, Peter Schofield, admitted to MPs that even he did not understand some of the letters that went out.The DWP error related to claimants who were awarded contributions-based ESA, when they may also have been entitled to income-related ESA. The forms sent to claimants did not make it clear they could be better off if they were eligible for the latter award. As a result they may have missed out on premium payments.ESA is an unemployment benefit paid to people with limited capability to work because of disability or illness. About 2.4 million Britons receive ESA, and in 2016-17 the total expenditure was £15bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf89630aabe6c257d9a779fda63bd6b720fd0b19/0_262_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09b03f87d7af62f8acc4b0c51812b33f","title":"festivalgoers urged to get mmr jab as measles infection rate soars","story":"People who missed out owing to late 90s scare stories warned of increased risk in crowded placesFestivalgoers who missed the MMR vaccination 20 years ago have been urged to get the jab before the European festival season, after infection rates in England tripled in a year.It has been 20 years since the controversy surrounding the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which falsely linked the jab to autism and resulted in a significant drop in its uptake. The health concerns of MMR were widely discredited and Andrew Wakefield, the doctor behind the research paper which made the claim, was struck off the medical register.The Royal College of Nursing has warned of an increased number of outbreaks of measles in parts of southern Europe. Young adults who may have missed the injection owing to scare stories in the late 90s are particularly at risk. This is because they are highly likely to be going on city breaks or visiting large European festivals such as Benicassim in Spain, which starts this weekend.While travellers to Europe do not often consider the need for vaccinations, since the beginning of 2018 there have been more than 757 cases of measles reported across England. This compares with 274 confirmed cases last year.The outbreaks are often associated with travel to European countries including Greece, Romania, Italy and France, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Measles, a highly infectious viral illness, is spread easily though airborne or droplet transmission, particularly in crowded places. Symptoms can last up to 10 days, and in few cases, can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. The MMR vaccine is available for free.Helen Donovan, professional lead for public health nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Measles is extremely infectious, especially where large crowds of people gather such as at festivals or in towns. Thanks to vaccination it’s become increasingly rare in the UK, but recent increases in infection rates shows we can’t be complacent.“Before you go on holiday this summer, make sure you are up to date with your vaccinations. Getting immunised is quick and simple – an appointment with your practice nurse will only take a few minutes. The MMR vaccine is free and will help prevent the spread of a particularly infectious and unpleasant disease.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23951dd96d76422534a19473540db17de8a175af/0_254_4492_2696/master/4492.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e92c518598cbed68a5676720a71a59aa","title":"england india third one day international match report","story":"England thrashed India by eight wickets with 33 balls to spare, a victory far more straightforward than anyone could have expected and one of the most rewarding since the last World Cup. This win secured the series 2-1 against the No 2 side in the world in the sort of conditions India would have welcomed: a dry surface offering some turn to their spin bowlers.England restricted India to 256 for eight, a target which is deemed to be a doddle in this era. But this match had the feel of a final, which made it all the more intriguing, and at the start there was more tension around as a consequence. That all vanished as rapidly as some of the Indian supporters in the last hour as Joe Root and Eoin Morgan calmly cruised to their goal in an unbroken partnership of 186. Root hit his 13th ODI century from the last ball of the match to become England’s most prolific ODI centurion, surpassing Marcus Trescothick.Perhaps the tension was only really evident in the India side as, for the second match in succession, England’s wrist-spinner Adil Rashid proved to be the most effective of the three on view – that must be some kind of record against India. England’s white‑ball specialist took three wickets, including the vital one of Virat Kohli with a delivery he will treasure for decades. More than anyone Rashid was responsible for the shackling of the India batsmen even though there were more economical bowlers on his side – both David Willey and Mark Wood were bang on target at the beginning and end of the innings.Rashid was the man of the match and seems to be benefiting from concentrating solely on the white‑ball game he is so much more confident in this format than in Test cricket. The soundest strategy may be to let him be until the 2019 World Cup is over since he has become such a crucial weapon for Morgan. Thereafter it might be a good idea to invite Rashid to reconsider bowling with a red ball.India’s innings began with unaccustomed wariness mainly because Wood and Willey found not only a good length but also a hint of swing. After 18 balls Rohit Sharma holed out off Willey for two. The introduction of Liam Plunkett hastened the run rate with his first two overs yielding 21 runs, mostly to silky cover drives by Shikhar Dhawan, but a moment of brilliance from Ben Stokes ended a dangerous partnership alongside India’s captain. Kohli clipped the ball to square leg but was not keen on a single. Dhawan was, however, and he advanced down the pitch a fraction too far. Stokes hurled the ball at the stumps at the bowler’s end and he hit them. There was no great celebration from the England side as the speed of Stokes’s throw deceived everyone.Kohli’s departure was even more influential. A fizzing leg‑break from Rashid pitched on middle and leg and passed the outside edge of the bat to clip the off bail. An aghast Kohli, who looked almost as astonished as Mike Gatting all those years ago against Shane Warne at Old Trafford, hesitated before departing. There followed a few nervous moments for England as the third umpire confirmed that the ball had broken the stumps before the intervention of Jos Buttler’s gloves, an outcome that would have relieved England’s wicketkeeper since he had earlier spilled a tough chance off Moeen Ali when Kohli was on 23. In the same over Suresh Raina was satisfyingly pouched at leg slip by Root – the satisfaction coming from the fact that England had stationed a leg slip in the first place.MS Dhoni tried to restore the innings but in the last two games he has looked like a man swimming against the tide. Shardul Thakur was the solitary batsman to cause any trouble when he hit the only two sixes of the innings in the penultimate over.England’s pursuit began rapidly. Jonny Bairstow had hit seven boundaries in nine deliveries before gently clipping the ball to midwicket. James Vince on his return to England colours settled easily, produced some graceful strokes and was then run out for an infuriating 27. He might have set off earlier for a sharp single he was perhaps unlucky that Dhoni redirected the ball on to the stumps so deftly.Then with barely a scare Root, the man of the series, and Morgan combined with purpose. On 69 Root was stumped off a no-ball from Yuzvendra Chahal on 85 Morgan was dropped at mid-on. Otherwise they coped admirably against the Indian spinners, who had so tormented them earlier in this series and the T20s and who were getting the ball to turn on such an arid surface. England had recognised a problem and resolved it, which is what good sides do. “Those spinners did for us again in the middle overs,” said one of the captains after the game and remarkably that was Kohli. It was Morgan who simply observed that his spinners were “brilliant”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45525a427c9804c3ec0edcd77d65e93a0af2641c/0_148_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f61e043e8d8a9b73e7083a5e674598","title":"la course womens tour de france remains way off","story":"The lack of a press conference for winner Annemiek van Vleuten shows the tacked-on status the race still holds despite positive noises from UCI president David LappartientDespite the cliff‑hanging nature of her victory there was no press conference for La Course winner Annemiek van Vleuten. Instead, with the Tour de France’s token nod to women’s racing done and dusted, the riders were quickly ushered off stage and the focus switched to the start line of the men’s Tour de France, across the valleys of the Haute-Savoie.This was the fifth edition of La Course and by general consensus easily the best race yet. But for the second year running, the Tour organisation had merely bolted the women’s one-day race on to the men’s Tour with a truncated version of a key Alpine stage.Despite the profile of La Course and the women’s Tour of Italy, a revitalised women’s Tour de France remains a long way off. Highlighting that, a group of French female cyclists, Des Elles au velo, are riding the route of the men’s Tour, a day ahead of the men’s race, in a bid to promote women’s stage racing and specifically a women’s Tour de France. Meanwhile the pressure on ASO, promoter of the men’s Tour, to rejuvenate the women’s Tour de France that it once organised, the long-lost Tour Feminin, is increasing.“I want to see a women’s Tour de France within the term of my presidency,” David Lappartient, the UCI president, said after his election last autumn. “La Course is nice, but ASO can do more and I have put pressure on them to achieve this.”Women’s racing, he says, has a bright future but adds that some women competing at World Tour level are earning less than €10,000 a year from racing. “That’s very bad, totally unacceptable. But you can see the passion around the women’s Tour of Britain, which is now one of the world’s top races for women, and the interest in La Course.“We have a lot of women’s teams but the base needs to be stronger and we are discussing with women’s teams how to improve the situation. I think cycling can be one of the top three women’s sports.”It is estimated that the top earners in women’s racing are paid around €200,000 a year, with the minimum wage for a full-time pro as low as €30,000. Even then, there remain some riders racing for free, while others work part-time or continue their education.However with a clutch of major sponsors – including Lizzie Deignan’s newly unveiled backer Trek – now able to pay riders to compete full-time, the number of riders able to focus their energies fully on training and racing, rather than stacking shelves to finance competing or studying to safeguard their futures, is growing.Yann Le Moenner, chief executive of the Tour promoter ASO, said that cycling will soon “definitely deserve a dedicated women’s Tour de France, with a lot of media attention”.Rachel Hedderman, who as Rachel Heal raced in the Olympics for Team GB but is now sports director for the UnitedHealthcare women’s team, is cautiously optimistic. “Women’s cycling in general seems to be on the up at the moment,” she said. “It’s a lot more talked about so I’m optimistic that ASO will run with it and start growing La Course. You’d hope there’d be a longer stage race, but if we start with a shorter race with a few stages, including a mountain stage, then good.“Once media coverage increases, then the investment will come from sponsors. The media coverage will drive the value to the sponsors. People aren’t doing it out of charity: it has to be a viable business. But the money that it takes to run a top tier women’s team is significantly less than a World Tour men’s team.”But even with the media circus that follows the men’s Tour on site, Le Moenner said a Tour Feminin would have to be a standalone event. “Logistically, it’s just not possible to do a women’s Tour running alongside the men’s Tour,” he said. “We need to work on the best solution to showcase women’s cycling, and the sooner the better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6282bd2aee170851ff74bd5dc2208b2ea6bc3b57/0_54_4884_2930/master/4884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d817076be6d391f7b091c430fd75addb","title":"the open no readmission policy controversy carnoustie","story":"It would be an exaggeration to say the Open Championship is causing widespread anger in Carnoustie. Nonetheless, one need not scrape far beneath the surface to discover grumblings of discontent.The subject in hand is straightforward for those attending the 147th Open if you leave the venue, you cannot get back in with the same ticket. Exceptions will be made on medical grounds, just as members of golf clubs affiliated to Carnoustie – who have bought advance season tickets and meet identification criteria – can come and go. This R\u0026ampA position, adopted last year and due to continue in 2019 at Portrush, is contrary to what occurs at Augusta National, the US\u0026nbspOpen and\u0026nbspWimbledon.Several months ago an online petition was launched by David Valentine, the proprietor of Simpson’s Golf Shop, which sits across the street from the Carnoustie links. By the time he stopped publicising it, close to 700 signatures had been added.The wording was strong: “The R\u0026ampA’s ‘No‑readmission’ policy will effectively lock them on‑course all day – every day unless they pay again. This goes against the 150-year-old tradition of the Open and is not in the interests of spectators who are – only now – beginning to realise the full effects of these restrictions.”Speaking this week, Valentine made it clear he is not at war with the R\u0026ampA but a degree of unrest remains. “The petition is still live so fans of the Open can give feedback about the policy,” he said. “Most local people agree the Open is the best golf event on the planet and the R\u0026ampA should be commended for helping juniors to come free and stay at the new campsite.“But there is a growing disappointment by local people with elderly relatives, young children, pets and local businesses because the new policy doesn’t allow them to pop out and back in, to take care of their responsibilities.“Frankly this should have been sorted by the Links Management who are custodians of the courses on behalf of the people who own them.” Therein lies a key Carnoustie distinction its three courses, including the championship one, are owned by the town.The Open is an expensive day out. Adult tickets for tournament days start at £80, though early bird tickets were available. The addition of a £4.50 bacon roll, £5 pint of lager, £10 burger and chips or £6 salad box may be avoided by some spectators if there was a chance to visit Carnoustie’s pubs and eateries before returning.Yet the R\u0026ampA remains adamant that its objective is not to squeeze every last penny from customers. Unofficial – or “pirate” – hospitality, which has been a huge and recurring headache at the Open, is its explanation. “That is a real issue for us,” said the R\u0026ampA chief executive, Martin Slumbers. “It degrades the Open. It undermines that fan experience and we have decided that the no-readmission policy is a core way, along with other things that we are doing, to reduce unofficial hospitality. That’s the primary reason.”Intrigue will naturally surround whether the R\u0026ampA retains this in its home of St\u0026nbspAndrews, where the Open will return in 2021. Businesses in the town, like Carnoustie within easy walking distance of the golf course, have a deep-rooted relationship with golf’s ruling body.In Carnoustie the inference is of a cooler alliance. Bill Thompson is captain of Carnoustie Golf Club, whose 800 members have links playing status. Their clubhouse sits adjacent to the Open.“The reality is that for approximately the last six weeks we have had a major disruption with regards the availability of golf courses to members,” he said. “That also has a massively negative effect on our commercial viability members don’t play, they don’t come into the club. We understand that’s a necessary evil but there is no compensation to us. If we get a marquee winner here, for the next 10 years everybody benefits but in the short-term it is difficult.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842b1c02c91deb6e7ae678f3b835ceba1eed684b/111_90_3126_1876/master/3126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b87d9d908fe614a6f040198d4cd0206","title":"tim brennan faugheen betfair","story":"• Tim Brennan denies passing information to his brother• Faugheen was declared non-runner in 2016 Champion HurdleThe Tim Brennan hearing has concluded with defence barristers insisting there were “plenty of other alternative sources” who could have prompted Betfair users to start laying Faugheen for the 2016 Champion Hurdle.Brennan – who has long been principal vet to Faugheen’s trainer, Willie Mullins – denies passing inside information to his brother, Michael, who is one of two punters known to have bet heavily against Faugheen two days before the horse was declared a non-runner.The British Horseracing Authority relies on the coincidence of timing between Michael Brennan laying the horse and phone contact with Tim. The BHA’s barrister, Philip Evans QC, pointed to the fact that Tim sent Michael a text message just minutes after news eventually broke of Faugheen’s injury and suggested it may have said: “Well, there you are, I told you so,” though the actual contents of the text are not known.But Edward Fitzgerald QC, who presented closing arguments for Brennan, said Michael Brennan could have received negative information about Faugheen from several other sources. “Lots of people knew there was a problem,” he said.He read out an internal BHA email which said the Irish Turf Club had “confidence” that another inidual connected to the Mullins yard was involved in passing information. The BHA could find no evidence against that person. “The Turf Club is far nearer to the scene of events than we are here and they know the characters,” Fitzgerald added.The panel heard thatanyone on Mullins’s staff might have noticed Faugheen had been on the “easy list” for a fortnight, and that members of Mullins’s staff also rode out sometimes at a nearby yard owned by Michael Brennan. Fitzgerald alluded to a possible source of information who “drinks in the same pub” as Mullins’s staff. He named Ted Hegarty, a bookmaker, as the other person who had layed Faugheen at about the same time as Michael Brennan using a similar amount of money. A BHA investigation found no connection between Hegarty and Tim Brennan. Fitzgerald said the evidence did not even show that the Brennan brothers spoke on the day Michael Brennan started betting against Faugheen, “far less that they shared confidential information”.Mullins’s evidence is a problem for the BHA, as he insisted Faugheen showed no sign of a problem in the hours immediately after being ridden on 15 February 2016, the day Brennan layed him. If that were accepted there would be no inside information for Tim Brennan to pass. Evans said he accepted Mullins’s honesty but queried whether his recollection was reliable and said the betting evidence “makes absolutely no sense” if the horse was not obviously lame that day.Tim Brennan gave consistent evidence during lengthy cross-examination, denying he had ever passed inside information to anyone. He said confidentiality is “the cornerstone of a vet or doctor’s career. You make an oath and swear to honour that.

It would have been nice to take it but it’s the Tour de France – nothing comes easy. But the team rode well, that was the main thing.”Behind Alaphilippe and Van Avermaet, Sky adopted their now familiar catenaccio style, controlling the peloton with a steady tempo on every climb and discouraging any further attacks. “There were some steep climbs and we were expecting it to really kick off somewhere on the last two,” Thomas said. “But that never really materialised. I guess there was a bit of a headwind on that last climb. With two big Alpine days to come everyone was probably saving it a bit – or on the limit. I don’t know.”It was a relatively uneventful day for Chris Froome too, apart from a puncture on the dirt section of the Plateau des Glieres climb. “It was a little bit of wacky races going on there,” Froome said. “I had a puncture, got a spare wheel from a teammate only to find out that was flat as well. So it was a little bit of a comedy of errors going on. But thankfully it was still far from the finish, so the race wasn’t too crazy and I was able to get back in.”Only a late foray by Dan Martin, winner of the stage to Mur de Bretagne, livened up the final ascent, the Col de la Colombière. “It was a block headwind so every bit of common sense said ‘don’t attack’, but our plan from the start was if guys are five or 10 seconds off the back at the top of the climb then it could be a minute by the finish line,” he said.“For the sake of doing a little sprint, making it hard, anybody put in the red could have been dropped,” said the Irishman, whose burst towards the final summit was enough to distance the Colombian Rigoberto Urán, second to Froome in Paris in 2017 and now almost four minutes behind the defending champion.Martin admitted, though, that the first Alpine stage had been something of a stalemate. “That’s what happens when you get three hard days in a row,” he said, referring to the forthcoming ski station finishes at La Rosiere and Alpe d’Huez. “The next two days are going to be brutal and also, this was the stage after the rest day but the wearing-down process has begun. There’s going to be a lot more guys attacking tomorrow.”If Thomas sounded disappointed not to pull on the maillot jaune, Dave Brailsford laughed off comments from Bradley Wiggins that his management style was “isive” and “self-serving”. The Team Sky principal said: “I’ve been called a lot worse. On my Richter scale, that’s not bad. I can take that. Over the years, we’ve always tried to build teams where the top guys are very close together and they have got their own ambitions.”But Brailsford also hinted that there had been lessons learned from the Froome‑Wiggins feud of July 2012, when both riders seemed intent on winning the Tour. “As you get older and wiser,” he said, “and you learn from your mistakes you know how to manage these situations, and openness is the key.You learn to talk to everybody together, be clear and frank with everybody, and these guys know the score.”But he was insistent there would be no infighting during this year’s Tour. “It’s a totally different dynamic from what we’ve had in the past – Chris and Geraint have grown up together, they have known each other a long time, they are 32 and 33 years old, they’re not young lads and they are pretty easy to manage, to be honest. Four of the riders are over 30, two are 28 and when you tot up how many Grand Tours they have done between them there is an enormous amount of experience on that bus,” Brailsford said.Alaphilippe, who also won a stage of the 2014 Tour de l’Avenir on similar roads that included the gravel section of the Plateau des Glières, also claimed the King of the Mountains jersey. It was the Quickstep team’s third stage win of the 2018 Tour and their 50th victory of the season.“It was a big objective to take a stage in the Tour de France and a really proud moment for me to win,” Alaphilippe said. “I was able to enjoy it a bit on the downhill and realise what I’d done. It was an incredible feeling in the last kilometre.”Stage 10: 1 J Alaphilippe (Fr) Quick-Step Floors 4hr 25min 27sec\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspI Izagirre (Sp) Bahrain-Merida +1:34 3 R Taaramae (Est) Direct Energie +1:40 4\u0026nbspG Van Avermaet (Bel) BMC +1:44 5 S Pauwels (Bel) Dimension Data\u0026nbspst 6\u0026nbspL\u0026nbspCalmejane\u0026nbsp(Fr) Direct Energie +2:24 7\u0026nbspD Martin (Ire) Emirates +3:23 8\u0026nbspP\u0026nbspRoglic (Svn) LottoNL-Jumbo 9\u0026nbspD\u0026nbspGaudu (Fr) Groupama-FDJ 10\u0026nbspG\u0026nbspThomas (GB) Sky all stKing of the mountains:\u0026nbsp1 J Alaphilippe (Fr) Quick-Step Floors 41pts\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspR Taaramae (Est) Direct Energie 28"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a17b097821f4c393cea4f954a973a11d64c846c/0_329_4482_2688/master/4482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=738db8753daa40a01ca762c2faf632c1","title":"a monster calls review old vic london","story":"Old Vic, LondonSally Cookson delivers an exhilarating production of Patrick Ness’s story about a lonely boy coping with grief, bullying and a monster in a yew treeSometimes it is good to go to the theatre in a state of innocence. I have neither read the prize-winning novel by Patrick Ness on which this show is based, nor seen the film adaptation. But I have caught the recent work of the play’s director, Sally Cookson, including her versions of Jane Eyre and La Strada, and this exhilarating production has the physical inventiveness and ensemble cohesion that are her trademarks. The story is a mix of moral fable and antique myth. Its hero is a lonely 13-year-old, Conor, who is bullied at school and coping with his mother dying of cancer. Resisting adult authority, including a disciplinarian gran and a dad briefly visiting from the US, Conor turns to a dream figure: a gigantic monster who sprouts from a yew tree in the local churchyard and offers to tell Conor three tales if the boy will, in return, tell him the truth. The strength of the story, inspired by an idea from Siobhan Dowd, is that it blends adolescent reality with fairytale fantasy. Since the monster’s message concerns emotional honesty, I confess I couldn’t share the snuffles and sobs around me at the story’s end. To borrow a phrase of Keats, I felt it clearly had “a palpable design upon us”. What really impressed me was the wit and elegance of Cookson’s staging and Michael Vale’s design. The visual concept is based on strands of rope that are twisted and tangled to form the gnarled branches of a yew tree, out of which Stuart Goodwin’s monster appears. With his bare torso, necklet of berries and commanding presence, Goodwin evokes folkloristic memories of Herne the Hunter and the Green Man. Rope is also used to suggest everything from a wicked queen’s crown to a car’s steering wheel. It is Cookson’s gift for creating a world out of simple props and actors’ bodies that gives the show its drive. Aside from rope, chairs are the other key ingredient used to convey both schoolroom regimentation and the wild disorder Conor creates in his detested gran’s home. Matthew Tennyson’s physical presence as Conor also gives the story its focus. He captures the vulnerability and solitude of a victimised 13-year-old: his eyes often seem to be fixed on the middle distance, as if reluctant to engage with other people. Yet Tennyson also displays a teenage stroppiness to the moralising monster, and the boy’s complex mixture of guilt and love towards his ailing mother. Praise is also due to Selina Cadell as Conor’s bossy gran, Marianne Oldham as his stoical mum and John Leader as a tormenting bully. Watching the show, I couldn’t help wondering if Ness’s title was a deliberate echo of An Inspector Calls. As in JB Priestley’s play, a mysterious outsider arrives to press home a moral point. But there is nothing formulaic about the monster’s stories, which invest Grimm-style fables with a Brechtian irony. Whereas Cookson’s production of Jane Eyre felt like a reductive account of a great novel, here there is an ideal balance between means and ends. The story, the acting and the music of Benji and Will Bower, at one point echoing Khachaturian, are all used to remind us that, whether children or adults, we all have to face the fact of mortality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/198611027af51cfa313a599dfa63dd0d26f26531/0_18_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43995a5e3260315610f382acfbd6a5d5","title":"tesla elon musk thailand diver pedo","story":"Tesla CEO called immature after attacking Vernon Unsworth, who rescued trapped childrenTesla investors have demanded an apology from CEO Elon Musk after he lashed out at a British cave er who rescued children in Thailand.Musk’s posts on Twitter sparked backlash from shareholders and Silicon Valley analysts, who called his behavior immature and an impediment to the car company’s success.The embattled CEO came under fire over the weekend after he baselessly called the er, Vernon Unsworth, a “pedo” on Twitter and doubled down on the insult before eventually deleting the posts. Musk had flown to Thailand and offered to assist in the rescue mission of 12 boys and their coach from a flooded cave by providing a submarine, but leaders of the operation declined his help. Unsworth, who was instrumental in the successful rescue, later said Musk’s effort was a “PR stunt”, prompting the Silicon Valley billionaire to say he would make a video proving his “mini-sub” would have worked, adding: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.” The er, who was still at the cave site assisting with clean-up, told the  he was “astonished and very angry” and considering legal action. Musk and Tesla have gone silent since he deleted the tweets, ignoring repeated requests for comment since Sunday. Some shareholders, however, are speaking up.James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, Tesla’s fourth-largest shareholder, told the  in an email on Tuesday that the company saw “the end of carbon as essential” but, was “frustrated that the real steps towards this are being overshadowed and undermined by this saga”.Anderson said he agreed with some of Musk’s past remarks calling out critical analysts, “but this is different. We are in contact with the company and we are hopeful that it is being taken with due seriousness.” He said he would like to see “peace, quiet and execution” at the electric car company. Musk has faced increasing scrutiny in recent months over his bizarre tirades on Twitter and his aggressive attacks on journalists, regulators and other critics. The scandals come amid continuing complaints about workplace safety and a struggle to meet production goals. If Musk’s behavior did not change, “it could have a dramatic negative impact on the company”, said Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm. “It has to start with an apology.”In addition to losing the confidence of investors, Munster said, “the irony here is that their brand is word of mouth.” The scandals “could negatively impact demand and access to capital”. Loup Ventures published an open letter to Musk on behalf of investors, saying the comments to Unsworth “crossed the line” and calling for an apology.“Over the last 6 months, there have been too many examples of concerning behavior that is shaking investor confidence,” the letter said.Jing Zhao, who recently filed a shareholder proposal to remove Musk as chairman of the Tesla board and install an independent director, said the CEO was being unprofessional and that it was “not his business” to travel to Thailand and try to directly solve the rescue challenges. Zhao said he believed Musk originally had “good intentions”, but that “humanitarian rescues … are professional tasks so we should trust others with local community connections.“He should focus on his profession,” Zhao said, adding that if Musk wanted to help these kinds of causes, he should have a separate charity organization. Zhao also said that this scandal offered further evidence that the company needed an independent chair: “He is not mature enough.”Tesla’s board members did not respond to requests for comment. Solar Shed, a British renewable-energy installer, said it would “no longer promote” Tesla-branded products and called on other solar firms to do the same, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The company’s managing director tweeted:“All it takes is a public apology Mr Musk and i will reverse our decision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d6f66197712174023653613ec15feb1f5580579/0_57_1533_920/master/1533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35804c6618b07a64d50711fbf9979cee","title":"always go slightly too far what makes ambush tv work who is america","story":"Sacha Baron Cohen’s Who Is America? follows a long line of TV troublemakers who fooled guests into self-sabotage, but his scattergun approach risks missing the markIf you’re going to pull TV pranks, it helps if you’re punching up. And you can’t set your sights much higher than the president of the US. Furthermore, if you’re going to prank any US administration, it may as well be the leadership grouping centred around the uniquely unstable cocktail of ego, malevolence, incompetence and absurdity that is Donald Trump. Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, Who Is America?, may not make it as far as the big man, but his ambition is clear. He did get as far as Sarah Palin who, hilariously, has complained that Baron Cohen “duped her”.Baron Cohen and Trump have previous. Somehow, Trump not only survived but prospered after his 2003 encounter with his character Ali G, who tried to pitch him a glove designed for wearing while eating ice-cream. This encounter has only acquired resonance in retrospect. Ali G’s various provocations rarely carried much in the way of moral weight. For nostalgic lefties of a certain age, there’s still a great deal of pleasure to be derived from watching him being gently schooled by a magnificently earnest Tony Benn (“Is it called the welfare state because it’s well fair?”). But, in fact, most of Ali G’s work was just gloriously daft. With Candid Camera having launched way back in 1948, the ambush prank show has deep roots. But variations on the format went into overdrive in the 1990s, a decade that, surely not coincidentally, saw celebrity culture spiral out of control. The form ided into three distinct strains. There were celebrity botherers, such as Paul Kaye’s berserk red carpet wraith Dennis Pennis. There were the old-school public pranksters, still taking their cue from the decidedly trad likes of Game for a Laugh. And then there were the worthy likes of Mark Thomas, who used pranks to punctuate and enliven admirable but often slightly dry activism. Then Chris Morris changed everything. In 1997, Brass Eye redefined the notion of TV celebrity pranking and rendered it almost obsolete. Brass Eye was ludicrous, hilarious and satirically deadly. The true colours of many public figures were revealed – they only fell for Morris if they were gullible (David Amess), careless (Bruno Brookes), desperate (Wolf from Gladiators) or all three (too many to mention). Brass Eye was one of those very rare TV programmes to actually cause a change in media law. An amendment informally known as the Brass Eye clause – which allowed interviewees to be misled for the purposes of entertainment – was incorporated into the broadcasting code. Artistically, Brass Eye opened up a space into which dozens of imitators duly leapt. Many were dismal, but Baron Cohen instantly stood out, for his immersion in character, his eye for the absurd and his sheer nerve. So, what makes a prankster work? What separates Ali G from Trigger Happy TV? Often, it’s intangible: you either warm to them or you don’t. But there are a few ground rules. For a start, the softer the targets, the funnier, swifter and more generous the prankster has to be. Humiliating unwitting and undeserving members of the public is rarely a good look. For example, Billy Eichner’s periodically inspired Billy on the Street works because his marks are usually laughing, too. Second, understand your shelf life. Pranksters are TV’s fireflies. Like a punk anthem in human form, Dennis Pennis was obnoxious, brutally effective, frill-free and over in a flash. Baron Cohen effects regular and complete metamorphoses. Morris has simply moved on. Also, the stakes have to be reasonably high. Baron Cohen’s Borat singing what he claimed to be “the Kazakhstan national anthem” in front of a horde of furious rednecks at a rodeo in Texas definitely qualifies. The rag-week japesters of Revolting trying to make a point about the Daily Mail by harassing bewildered BBC employees during their lunch breaks definitely does not.Finally – and perhaps most importantly – always go slightly too far. Morris did not only attempt to buy fictional drugs off real-life drug dealers. He attempted to buy fictional drugs off real-life drug dealers wearing a nappy and a massive red balloon on his head. It’s here that Baron Cohen usually wins and, it appears, has won again. Who is America? has been billed as “the most dangerous show in the history of television”. Normally, this would sound hyperbolic. But, in this case, who knows? Like it or not, in satirical terms, the Trump White House (and its many bottom-feeding minions who Baron Cohen seems to have duped) represents the biggest of big game. If Baron Cohen is going to top this, Vladimir Putin had better keep his eyes peeled for an unfamiliar Ukrainian diplomat with an unplaceable accent and a slight air of mischief. Go on, Sacha, we dare you.

It will be written and co-executive-produced by Caroline Dries, best known as the executive producer of The Vampire Diaries. Dries has also worked with the network on shows such as Melrose Place and Smallville, another DC Comics property.The lead character, who will be introduced this December at the CW’s annual DC Comics crossover event, is described as a woman “armed with a passion for social justice and flair for speaking her mind”.Kate Kane is an out lesbian who has arrived in Gotham to handle a citywide resurgence in crime. “But don’t call her a hero yet,” reads the show’s synopsis. “In a city desperate for a savior, Kate must overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be Gotham’s symbol of hope.”Originally introduced in the 1950s as a love interest for Batman to dispel rumors of homosexuality, Batwoman has since been the highest-profile openly gay character from any DC comic. In 2006, Batwoman was reintroduced as a lesbian of Jewish descent while Renee Montoya, a former Gotham police detective, was revealed as a love interest. At the time, Dan Didio, co-publisher of DC Comics, said Kane was written as a lesbian because “we wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase”.DC Comics have been at the forefront of LGBT visibility in comics, recently featuring the first gay superhero couple with Midnighter and Apollo and introducing The Ray as a gay man in the The Ray Rebirth. Supergirl, which airs on the CW, revealed in 2016 that the titular character’s sister Alex Danvers is a lesbian, and appears to be casting a transgender character in its new season. But other comic universes, like Marvel, have trailed when it comes to issues of queer representation. In last year’s big-screen version of Thor: Ragnarok, Tessa Thompson played Valkyrie, Marvel’s first ever openly bisexual character. But the actor later revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone that a scene confirming Valkyrie’s sexuality was cut from the film. If Batwoman is picked up for series, Kate Kane will become the first ever LGBT lead of a live-action superhero show. Moreover, December’s crossover event, which will feature the casts of Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and Supergirl, will mark Batwoman’s first live-action appearance ever.

About 160,000 civilians have fled towards the Golan Heights, the region annexed by Israel from Syria.Syrian government forces have launched a brutal bombardment of the region around Quneitra in an effort to force the surrender of rebel groups that still control territory in the region.Israel has said it will not allow any refugees to cross the border, despite urgent calls by humanitarian agencies saying their safety is at risk. They are trapped between the Israeli border and advancing regime forces with little shelter from the harsh summer weather.The intensity of the bombardment was such that dozens sought refuge in Israel despite the country’s status as an archenemy of Syria. Israel has allowed a limited number of civilians as well as fighters entry into the country since 2013 for treatment from injuries - one report in 2017 said Israel had treated over 3,000 Syrians including 600 children since 2013. The regions of Deraa and Quneitra had long been considered areas of strategic importance where Israel hoped to limit the advance of Assad-aligned Iranian militias. But the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated last week that Israel would accept Syrian government control of the region.Reuters said the civilians retreated after being urged to do so by Israeli border guards.The Assad regime is expected to establish control over southern Syria in the coming days as it seeks a military victory over rebels in a seven-year civil war that was sparked by protesters demonstrating against the government torture of civilians in southern Syria.Last week the government hoisted its flag on rebel-controlled parts of Deraa, a symbolic victory in the birthplace of the uprising."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3568349.1531853684!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin colleges to merge into technological university in january","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach  Leo Varadkar, Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O’Connor and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe pictured at DIT’s Grangegorman campus on Tuesday.  Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.The State’s first technological university - based on the merger of Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown - is set to be the country’s biggest third level institution.The new university will be developed on three campuses – at Grangegorman, Blanchardstown and Tallaght – and will have a student population of about 28,500.It will formally known as Technological University Dublin when the change comes into force next January.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and three Ministers made the announcement at DIT’s new campus at Grangegorman on Tuesday.In all, 10 of the State’s 14 Institutes of Technology form part of four separate groups in Dublin, Munster, Connacht-Ulster and the southeast that are bidding to become technological universities.The Munster bid – which includes Cork Institute of Technology and IT Tralee – is widely expected to be second in line to secure the status.Mr Varadkar said the move represented a “new departure” in Irish higher education.“Technological universities are central to delivering on this vision and will stimulate a more balanced growth of population and employment across Ireland, ” he said.“The ambition is simple: to drive regional development and provide more opportunities for iniduals, enterprise and the community.” Minister for Education Richard Bruton said “TU Dublin” has the potential to be ground-breaking by providing a flexible teaching and learning framework to students. “This is an opportunity to build a new higher education system that is inclusive and reflects the educational demands and economic needs of Ireland,” he said.Prof Tom Collins,chair of the three institutes’ governing bodies, said the designation was the culmination of seven years of hard work. “The process of engaging with the independent international panel that visited Dublin in May gave us the opportunity to highlight the potential for TU Dublin to be ground-breaking by providing a pioneering and practice-based, research-informed learning framework to students,” he said.While the creation of technological universities attracts widespread political support, senior university sources have expressed alarm at what they say is the dilution of criteria for institutes seeking the new status. They fear this could damage the international reputation of higher education.The Department of Education, however, has insisted there has been no “dumbing down” of standards required for institutes of technology to secure new technological university status.In the meantime, Minister of State for higher education Mary Mitchell O’Connor said a draft order is required to be placed before the Oireachtas for approval in the forthcoming legislative term to appoint the day in early January on which three institutions will be dissolved and the new Technological University Dublin is established.“Today is the dawning of new era in Ireland’s higher education history.

(A total of) €1,142 – 20 per cent of the full cost – was in relation to train and taxi costs.Internal audit was unable to verify if the airline ticket costing €2,812 was business class as the travel class was not evident on the receipt provided.Where the restaurant receipts were in English, half the cost was claimed. Where the restaurant was in Japanese, the full cost was claimed.”The audit said that in another case, of a trip to the United States, 50 per cent of a restaurant receipt was claimed which equated to €135 and that “tips were also evident”.In another case, of a trip to Poland, an invoice for wine at a cost of €36 and a tip of €13 was submitted.The auditors maintained it represented a breach of continuing medical education guidelines if expenditure on alcohol and tips was incurred.Auditors also raised concerns about a lack of internal controls regarding the lodge, a 51-bed unit on the grounds of St Luke’s Hospital which was used primarily by patients and at which family and friends could stay for a cash fee of €20 a day."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3568300.1531849390!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"five hse staff overpaid nearly 300 000 audit finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHealth Service Executive: Auditors examined the files of 74 personnel and discovered overpayments in 24 cases. Photographer Brenda FitzsimonsFive Health Service Executive staff received overpayments amounting to nearly €300,000 between them, according to an internal audit report which examined personnel files. The overpayments arose from how the staff were appointed to acting-up roles over recent years or subsequently regularised into higher positions, internal auditors found. In one case, an inidual received a total overpayment of more than €70,000 while two others received overpayments of more than €61,000. HSE corporate management told internal auditors that there may have been “systemic” issues at play that would raise legitimate concerns.Thousands of staff across the health service had undertaken acting-up posts when the official moratorium on employment was in place. A process to regularise such staff into a higher post was put in place after the Haddington Road agreement was reached in October 2013 and on foot of other talks between unions and management.However, a new HSE internal audit into the regulation of posts in the DublinNorth East and DublinMid-Leinster regions has made highly critical findings.Overall the audit identified:* Inconsistent applications of controls in initial acting-up appointments resulting in significant overpayments* Non-adherence to the terms of the regularisation process* A lack of documentary evidence to support cases for regularisation, resulting in overpayments* Inconsistency in dealing with applications and* Use of the regularisation process for a purpose not intended such as to regrade posts.The auditors said on foot of its examination of a sample of cases, there was “no evidence of review, sign-off or sanction to acting up in the majority of cases”. “There was no evidence that regional managers reviewed documentation in relation to the back-up for the regularisation application.”Also. “In one instance, it was specifically noted in an email from one HR manager to another that ‘while the relevant national director may not be familiar with the details of the cases being presented, the applications should still be forwarded to them for sign-off’.”The report maintained the HR manager said: “This has been the approach of other HSE regions and would be appropriate in terms of audit compliance.”Auditors examined the files of 74 personnel and discovered overpayments in 24 cases (33 per cent of them).“As at June 30th, 2017, the top five overpayments amounted to €298,724. The overpayment arose because some employees incorrectly received increments on the scale of the post they were acting into throughout the years and were incorrectly regularised on the maximum point of the higher-grade scale when the position was regularised. This led to inequity in the treatment of employees. These overpayments need to be recouped by the HSE.”The audit report said there were instances where employees were upgraded when there was no vacant post being acted into. In one instance, an employee had been placed on a salary scale which was no longer in existence at the time of the appointment and there was no evidence of a vacant post in existence.It said in another case overtime was paid instead of an allowance.The audit said that, in one of the sample cases examined, an employee was appointed to act up into a higher position and the salary awarded was at the top of the higher scale while an additional personal allowance was also paid.“This represented an increase in salary of €30,530 per annum and was inconsistent with the treatment of other employees whose allowances were based on the difference between their substantive salary and the minimum point of the higher scale in line with the guidelines.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside the ryanair flight that made an emergency landing","story":"  July 14, 2018People seen bleeding from ears after Dublin flight to Croatia makes emergency landing   July 14, 2018Croatia-bound flight in emergency landing   July 16, 2018Airline says \u0026lsquosmall number\u0026rsquo of passengers treated as a precaution after the incident "},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3568415.1531859496!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national minimum wage likely to rise to 9 80","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAny increase in the national minimum wage on foot of the new recommendation could benefit up to 120,000 workers.

It said costs for small businesses were “already shooting up”.“We cannot repeat the mistakes of the recent past by allowing costs to get out of control in times of economic growth,” the association said. “It is vital that in 2019 there is no further increase in the national minimum wage rate.”The Low Pay Commission was established by the Fine GaelLabour coalition in 2015 to advise the Government on the appropriate rate for the national minimum wage.

Photograph:  CollinsThe Citizen’s Assembly should be recalled to consider a constitutional referendum to end religious control of schools, according to the Labour Party.Labour senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin began a petition to support this approach on Tuesday, saying a referendum could “end the influence of religion over education in Ireland.”“We don’t believe that children should be separated on the basis of religion in education,” Mr Ó Ríordáin said, adding it was time to “break the link between religion and education in Ireland”.After the same-sex marriage and abortion referendums, Mr O Riordain said the “next major constitutional question to be asked of the Irish people relates to Church control over Irish education.”He said the State in the past had been trying to protect the rights of minority religions, “but that time is past.”“What we want is for religion to be a private matter,” Mr Ó Ríordáin said.Asked if religion should be taught at all in schools, Mr Ó Ríordáin said: “I don’t necessarily believe it’s a priority for the education system.“The education system should be about having children together from all different backgrounds and if religion is important to parents or to a community, it can certainly be done outside of school time or perhaps at the weekend, or the churches themselves could step up to the plate.”However, at a press event announcing the petition, Mr Ó Ríordáin’s colleagues Ged Nash and Ivana Bacik, intervened to say it should be possible to teach about different religions in schools, but that instruction in particular religions should be stopped in State-funded schools.Mr Nash said children could be taught about the importance of religion in the formation of society. “What we’re talking about is not to have a single emphasis on a particular religion and faith based education, or religious instruction - that’s the difference,” he said.“It is important young people should have an understanding of religious traditions,” he added. “The same could be said about introducing philosophy in schools.”Ms Bacik said her children were in a multi-denominational school and were “taught broadly about different religions and different faiths and different traditions through a general religious education programme but what they don’t have is religious instruction.”“We have a disproportionate influence of religious bodies over education in Ireland. Over 90 per cent of primary schools are under religious control. It’s not reflective of the modern Ireland. And the only way we can deal with this effectively is to have a constitutional referendum to deal with the issue,” Mr Ó Ríordáin said.He said the referendum could take place next year if there was the political will by the Government.He said as a teacher and headmaster in the past he had pledged to uphold the Catholic ethos of the schools in which he taught. “If you join the army, you wear the boots,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3567114.1531768142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"5 500 year old passage tomb at dowth is find of a lifetime","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Clíodhna Ní  Lionáin, Devenish’s lead archaeologist at the passage tomb site at Dowth Hall, Co Meath. Photograph: Cyril ByrneA 5,500-year-old passage tomb uncovered at Dowth Hall in the heart of the Brú na Bóinne World Heritage site in Co Meath is “the most significant megalithic find in Ireland in the last 50 years”, archaeologists believe.The ancient burial chamber, believed to be about 40m in diameter and half the size of nearby Newgrange, was discovered during archaeological investigations by the agri-technology company Devenish and UCD school of archaeology.Brú na Bóinne is the area within the bend of the river Boyne that contains one of the world’s most important prehistoric landscapes. Dowth Hall and lands were acquired by Devenish in 2013.To date, two burial chambers have been discovered within the western part of the main passage tomb, over which a large stone cairn was raised.Archaeologists working on the site since May last year say the six kerbstones identified so far would have formed part of a ring of stones that followed the cairn perimeter.One kerbstone is heavily decorated with Neolithic carvings and represents “one of the most impressive discoveries of megalithic art in Ireland for decades”, the archaeologists said.Devenish’s lead architect for the project, Dr Clíodhna Ní Lionáin, said that for the archaeologists involved in the discovery, it was “very exciting” and “truly the find of a lifetime”.She said the the team was working on the theory that the tomb could have been one of the earliest ones constructed in the area. “It’s a bit smaller than the more well-known monuments like Newgrange and Knowth. It’s around half the size of Newgrange but we think it might have been slightly earlier,” she said.“But of course we need to do further investigation and try to find material that we can date fairly precisely to be sure of that theory.”Dr Ní Lionáin said the people who built the tombs would probably have been “the children or grandchildren or great grandchildren of some of the first farmers in Ireland”.“In terms of designing these monuments, they were really good architects, engineers and also astronomers, because we often get alignments on various different solstices. And we can also see from what the art we have here they were amazing artists as well. Even though we don’t know what this art means, everyone who comes here is struck by this art.”Dr Steve Davis, of the UCD school of archaeology, said it was “the most significant” megalithic find in Ireland in the last 50 years.He said the spate of archaeological discoveries in Brú na Bóinne in recent weeks “highlights what a globally significant place this is”. A number of other significant archaeological sites were discovered at Brú na Bóinne just last Friday during a Government-commissioned aerial survey of the heritage site.A planning application to renovate Dowth Hall, one of the most important protected structures in the Brú na Bóinne area, was lodged by Dr Owen Brennan, executive chairman of Devenish, and his wife, Prof Alice Stanton, in 2016.The 18th-century house on the 430-acre estate will become the Brennan family home and they have said it will also be used as a venue for “stimulating discussion on sustainable agriculture and promoting human and environmental health”.Dr Brennan said Devenish had invested in the farm at Dowth because of its fertile soil, its location beside the Boyne and its beautiful landscape.“It is hugely valuable, and indeed core to our company’s science-based ethos, that we preserve and protect this major heritage site for future generations.”Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan visited the site on Monday and said that “to know that this historic site will be preserved for future generations to see, understand and cherish is positive in every respect”.Dowth Hall and its lands will be open to the public on occasions throughout the year, including during Heritage Week, which runs from August 18th to 26th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3567748.1531853644!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit q a what has happened in westminster and what does it mean for the border backstop","story":"British PM Theresa May won a series of votes in parliament on Monday (July 16), keeping her over-arching strategy to leave the European Union just about on track after bowing to pressure from Brexit supporters in her party.

Photograph: Matt CardyAFPGetty Images\u0026nbspTheresa May’s government caved in to hardline Brexiteers in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group (ERG) on Monday night by accepting four amendments to a customs bill. They rule out a customs union with the EU without primary legislation say Britain can’t collect tariffs for the EU unless the EU does the same for Britain demand that Britain must have a separate VAT policy to the EU and rule out different customs arrangements for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Conservative Remainers, outraged by the government’s capitulation, proposed their own amendments to a trade bill on Tuesday. The most important, which was defeated by six votes, would have kept Britain in a customs union with the EU unless an arrangement for frictionless trade was agreed by January 2019. Another amendment, to keep Britain aligned to the European medicines regulatory network, was passed.What does all this mean for the Chequers proposal?The prime minister says the amendments accepted on Monday night make no difference to the Chequers plan because they reflect government policy. But Brexiteers think they have killed the proposal, pointing out that it is now under fire from both wings of the party, with former education secretary and Remainer Justine Greening rejecting it on Monday.The amendment on collecting tariffs for the EU does appear to contradict the Chequers plan and last week’s white paper, which did not demand reciprocity for the EU. More importantly, the Brexiteers’ show of strength serves as a reminder to the prime minister that they could torpedo any deal she brings back from Brussels.The amendment ruling out different customs arrangements for Northern Ireland is in conflict with the EU’s backstop proposal, which would treat Northern Ireland as part of the EU customs union after Brexit. But May has already rejected that proposal, asserting that no British prime minister would ever agree to impose a border in the Irish Sea.This amendment was nodded through on a voice vote on Monday night, reflecting the support of many Labour MPs for the prime minister’s position. But as negotiations over the backstop continue in Brussels over the next few weeks, the EU side will play down the impact of a different customs and regulatory regime for Northern Ireland in the hope of reaching agreement.The EU’s position remains that, without an agreement on the backstop, there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition period after Brexit. By putting Britain’s opposition to the EU backstop proposal into law, May’s government has limited its room for manoeuvre in negotiations.The prime minister meets the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday amid rumours that letters calling for a confidence vote in her leadership are piling up. It takes 48 MPs to force such a vote but 159 to win it and if May wins, she cannot be challenged for another 12 months.Parliament is due to break up for the summer next week, and the government on Tuesday night abandoned a plan to start the holidays five days early after it became clear that most MPs would oppose it. Brexit negotiations continue in Brussels throughout the summer with both sides saying they want to agree a deal by October. This week’s shenanigans at Westminster have weakened May’s hand in Brussels and made a deal in October less likely.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: PA WireTheresa May has escaped defeat by just six votes on an amendment that would have kept Britain in a customs union with the European Union in the absence of another arrangement to keep trade frictionless. But the government suffered a surprise defeat when 12 pro-European Conservative rebels helped pass an amendment to keep Britain in the European medicines regulatory network.The votes came at the end of a heated day at Westminster as pro-European Conservatives sought to exact revenge on the government for caving in to Brexiteer demands on Monday. The government negotiated openly with the rebels on the floor of the House of Commons, with treasury minister George Hollingbery offering to introduce a version of the customs union amendment in the Lords if the Commons version was withdrawn.Former education secretary Nicky Morgan made clear that the rebels backing the amendment were partly motivated by anger at Conservative Brexiteers’ efforts to wreck the prime minister’s Chequers plan.“The prime minister did the right thing by putting on the table a workable, practical proposal, captured at Chequers, which could be negotiated with the EU. Members of these benches chose to try to scupper that agreement and those proposals yesterday. Some of us tried to stop them. Sadly we failed,” she said.“We give the prime minister space for those negotiations. But it is very clear that in this House there is a majority for a customs union to safeguard business and jobs and the financial interests of our constituents in the future.”In the end, 12 Conservative rebels backed the amendment but four Labour MPs and one MP currently suspended by Labour voted with the government.\u0026nbspThe amendment on the European medicines regulatory network was tabled by Phillip Lee, who resigned as a justice minister last month in protest against the government’s Brexit policy.“This is vital because that is how we get our people and our NHS the medicines they need. It is also important for our pharmaceutical sector. The European medicines regulatory network partnership makes the process of accessing life-saving new medicines and moving medicines quick and easy. If we leave that partnership, the NHS would get ground-breaking new drugs like those for cancer, dementia and diabetes long after other parts of the world,” he said.Dr Lee’s amendment was passed by 305 votes to 301, with 12 Conservatives rebelling against the government to join the opposition in backing it.A government spokesperson said the amendment went beyond the commitment in last week’s Brexit White Paper to participate in the European Medicines Agency and suggested it would seek to amend it in the Lords.“As set out in the White Paper, the UK is seeking participation in the European Medicines Agency. We would look to be an active participant and this would involve making an appropriate financial contribution. We will now reflect on this amendment and seek to revisit in the Lords,” the spokesperson said.As Conservative MPs reported unrest among party activists over the Chequers proposal, the prime minister spent much of Tuesday meeting representatives from Conservative associations to brief them on her plans. On Wednesday she will face questions in the House of Commons before attending a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.Teenage son of British oil executive killed in Corfu speedboat tragedyLondoners least liberal on homosexuality and pre-marital sexDisabled comedian \u0026#39humiliated\u0026#39 by train staff rejects apologyThe Five Billion Pound Super Sewer, review: it turns out that watching people boring a big hole is, well, boringInside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network revealed the disturbing posts that Facebook allows on its site – reviewBody of enforcer for notorious crime family exhumed after two raids by grave robbersJeremy Corbyn called an \u0026#39anti-Semite and a racist\u0026#39 by former Labour ministerSwimwear model wins praise after breastfeeding daughter on catwalk Vienna\u0026#39s metro hands out 14,000 deodorants to passengers amid stifling summer heatwaveBBC art historian says galleries prevent visitors taking phone photos so they can sell more tea-towels and postcardsEmmanuel Macron urges business to hire talent from \u0026#39World Cup banlieues\u0026#39Comment: Why is Britain enforcing a hosepipe ban in one of the wettest places on the planet?Russia did interfere in US election, says Trump, as he admits \u0026#39misspeaking\u0026#39 at Putin press conferenceSpanish charity accuses Libyan coastguard of leaving a woman and toddler to die in the MediterraneanEx-Ukip councillor convicted of killing wife told police: ‘I’ve been a very naughty boy’Comment: In another nail-biting Brexit vote, Theresa May clings on... but for how much longer?Barack Obama attacks \u0026#39strongman politics\u0026#39, saying world at crossroads between Mandela vision and \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 timesScientists develop early warning system to predict dengue outbreakLet Romanov family rest in peace together, says Princess on 100th anniversary of the murders which shocked the worldParents should not be allowed to opt children out of RE classes, former Education Secretary saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers. In Afghanistan, you have no shortage of really interesting issues to cover.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Teenage son of British oil executive killed

obstructing his view of a Rembrandt paintingA BBC art historian has said art galleries prevent visitors taking phone photographs so they can sell more tea-towels and postcards, after he was told off for photographing an exhibit at the National Gallery in Scotland.Dr Bendor Grosvenor, who presents Fake or Fortune, posted a picture of a waving hand obstructing his iPhone’s view of a Rembrandt painting, and wrote: “I\u0027d love to be able to show you how excellent the new ⁦@NatGalleriesSco⁩ Rembrandt exhibition is. But at the merest hint of my iPhone, an assistant rushed over to say no photos allowed, and demand that I delete the photo I\u0027d taken (of his hand).”He told The  that the rules are in place for licensing reasons, so galleries can sell more merchandise.The art writer explained: “What museums do is they try and raise the revenue by selling image licenses by reproducing their photos. If ordinary punters take photos then they think that stops their ability to do that. But someone taking a picture on their iPhone isn\u0027t going to start making up tea-towels.”Dr Grosvenor argued that museums could be shooting themselves in the foot with this rule, because social media posts of paintings can drum up excitement for an exhibition.He explained: Of course, if you think about it, every person in that exhibition these days is a little advertising agent for that exhibition, I just wanted to tweet a little photograph from inside the exhibition and show how excellent the exhibition was, so people would go.  If they don\u0027t want me to do that then that\u0027s their loss.I was in the National Gallery the other day and the only noise you could hear was the poor guard moving around saying \u0027No photos! No photos!’\u0027. Museums and galleries are often the slowest to move with the times.Civilisations presenter Dr Simon Schama agreed, and said photographs should only be banned in the case of “obnoxious selfie sticks” which block the view.Dr Schama told The : “There are some obnoxious things that I don\u0027t think should be there like selfie sticks or taking selfies in front of paintings. I wouldn\u0027t mind banning that. But for people to take photos of details of the works of art, I honestly can\u0027t see what the problem is at all.”Dr Simon Schama said he frequently takes photographs at galleries for his workHe said the ban is “all about copyright and museum revenue and income,” explaining:  The copyright issue is essentially about the work of living artists but not an issue for Rembrandt. Dr Grosvenor and I thought Rembrandt would love it, he would see it as a great commercial marketing initiative.”Dr Schama said he often is “followed around” galleries by guards when he comes to the UK because he takes photographs.He said being told off for taking pictures is “quite aggravating and not doing that makes for a much happier gallery experience.”The historian added: “You can, providing you\u0027re not obnoxious and get in the way, you can take photos of tiny details of brushwork that you wouldn\u0027t get on a postcard.“They can be fantastic research tools if you want to see how the paint lies on the painting. I do that all the time. Then you have a photo archive to work with. You can see it in much more detail than on an online picture.”A spokesperson for the National Galleries of Scotland told The : “Visitors to the National Galleries of Scotland are welcome to take photographs or video for personal, non-commercial use. All other uses require prior permission from National Galleries of Scotland.“Photography is usually not permitted in special exhibitions which include works that do not belong to NGS. This is primarily because many lenders (private and public) understandably require us to restrict or ban photography of the works that they have entrusted to our care. Photography within the permanent collection may also be restricted for some loaned works of art, as indicated by a \u0027Please do not photograph\u0027 notice on wall labels of certain works.”Please review our commenting policyTeenage son of British oil executive killed in Corfu speedboat tragedyLondoners least liberal on homosexuality and pre-marital sexDisabled comedian \u0026#39humiliated\u0026#39 by train staff rejects apologyThe Five Billion Pound Super Sewer, review: it turns out that watching people boring a big hole is, well, boringInside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network revealed the disturbing posts that Facebook allows on its site – reviewBody of enforcer for notorious crime family exhumed after two raids by grave robbersJeremy Corbyn called an \u0026#39anti-Semite and a racist\u0026#39 by former Labour ministerSwimwear model wins praise after breastfeeding daughter on catwalk Vienna\u0026#39s metro hands out 14,000 deodorants to passengers amid stifling summer heatwaveEmmanuel Macron urges business to hire talent from \u0026#39World Cup banlieues\u0026#39Comment: Why is Britain enforcing a hosepipe ban in one of the wettest places on the planet?Russia did interfere in US election, says Trump, as he admits \u0026#39misspeaking\u0026#39 at Putin press conferenceSpanish charity accuses Libyan coastguard of leaving a woman and toddler to die in the MediterraneanEx-Ukip councillor convicted of killing wife told police: ‘I’ve been a very naughty boy’Comment: In another nail-biting Brexit vote, Theresa May clings on... but for how much longer?Barack Obama attacks \u0026#39strongman politics\u0026#39, saying world at crossroads between Mandela vision and \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 timesScientists develop early warning system to predict dengue outbreakLet Romanov family rest in peace together, says Princess on 100th anniversary of the murders which shocked the worldParents should not be allowed to opt children out of RE classes, former Education Secretary saysTour de Yorkshire routes could see cyclists banned after angry motorists complain they hog roadsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/17/TELEMMGLPICT000169654083_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqC_LLCXkS_z-CZqgOMP7Bex-N4NEc-TKogDHRU-POfyI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"emmanuel macron urges business hire talent world cup banlieues","story":"French First Lady Brigitte Macron holds up the World Cup trophy with Paul Pogba as French President Emmanuel Macron receives the France football team during a ceremony at the Elysee Palace on July 16President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday urged 100 bosses of France’s biggest companies gathered at the Elysée to commit to taking on talent from disaffected suburbs where many of the country’s triumphant World Cup team grew up. He also promised unions that his presidency was entering a “new phase” in which he would listen to them more closely after a year of whirlwind reform in which he largely ignored their protests.The Elysée meeting came a day after hundreds of thousands took to the streets in wild celebrations at France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia in Moscow, in what the president called a “beautiful” show of unity. Yet there are persistent complaints in France that sport remains perhaps the only area where such national unity prevails, and that citizens of the country’s multi-ethnic banlieues, its poor suburbs, are cut off and discriminated against.Unemployment in many such areas is around 20 per cent, double the national average, while youth unemployment hovers at around 40 per cent, 15 points above the average, and poverty as high as 40 per cent.  Mr Macron was due to call on the bosses to take immediate, visible commitments to create jobs and apprenticeships in such areas, said his aides. Dubbed “the president of the rich” by his detractors, the French leader has been criticised for putting off a plan for the poor until after the World Cup. Emmanuel Macron delivers the closing speech during the \u0026#39Les Entreprises S\u0026#39engagent\u0026#39 (\u0026#39Companies are committing\u0026#39, or \u0026#39Companies get involved\u0026#39) forum held at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on July 17He has also received flak for binning a €50 billion plan released in May by former environment minister Jean-Louis Borloo to shake up 19 areas in the suburbs including the police, the justice system, education, and culture.By way of explanation, he said there was no point announcing yet another new plan “between two white men who don’t live in these districts”. Instead, he pledged non-budgeted measures from 30,000 job internships for 14-year olds to extra nursery places and blind testing in multinationals for discrimination when hiring.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Macron met all the heads of France’s unions to discuss reforms for the poor, pensions and unemployment benefit.Union bosses are still licking their wounds after the government rushed through reforms of France’s labour code and railways in his first year in power, despite a three-month strike, while cutting business and wealth taxes.Francois Asselin, the head of the CPME small companies, said Tuesday\u0027s meeting was a “turning point”.Emmanuel Macron celebrates the victory with his wife BrigitteThe president said: \u0027In the first year of my presidency, I had to unblock certain situations, I went fast, that was my decision and I don\u0027t apologise for it\u0027, he said. \u0027Now I\u0027m entering a new phase where I\u0027ll have to rely more on social partners’.”The government is due to push ahead with more economic and social reforms, including changes to unemployment insurance aimed at encouraging workers to take on new jobs, as well as a pension reform.Philippe Martinez, head of the hardline CGT, said the president had “agreed that he had called the tune last year without listening to us much”, and hoped that he was prepared to “change social policy”.While Right-wing support for the centrist Mr Macron remains strong, he lost support from the Left and aides have urged him to redress the balance.But in a speech to both houses of parliament this month, he said: “If you want to share the cake, you\u0027ve got to have a cake.”Teenage son of British oil executive killed in Corfu speedboat tragedyLondoners least liberal on homosexuality and pre-marital sexDisabled comedian \u0026#39humiliated\u0026#39 by train staff rejects apologyThe Five Billion Pound Super Sewer, review: it turns out that watching people boring a big hole is, well, boringInside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network revealed the disturbing posts that Facebook allows on its site – reviewBody of enforcer for notorious crime family exhumed after two raids by grave robbersJeremy Corbyn called an \u0026#39anti-Semite and a racist\u0026#39 by former Labour ministerSwimwear model wins praise after breastfeeding daughter on catwalk Vienna\u0026#39s metro hands out 14,000 deodorants to passengers amid stifling summer heatwaveBBC art historian says galleries prevent visitors taking phone photos so they can sell more tea-towels and postcardsComment: Why is Britain enforcing a hosepipe ban in one of the wettest places on the planet?Russia did interfere in US election, says Trump, as he admits \u0026#39misspeaking\u0026#39 at Putin press conferenceSpanish charity accuses Libyan coastguard of leaving a woman and toddler to die in the MediterraneanEx-Ukip councillor convicted of killing wife told police: ‘I’ve been a very naughty boy’Comment: In another nail-biting Brexit vote, Theresa May clings on... but for how much longer?Barack Obama attacks \u0026#39strongman politics\u0026#39, saying world at crossroads between Mandela vision and \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 timesScientists develop early warning system to predict dengue outbreakLet Romanov family rest in peace together, says Princess on 100th anniversary of the murders which shocked the worldParents should not be allowed to opt children out of RE classes, former Education Secretary saysTour de Yorkshire routes could see cyclists banned after angry motorists complain they hog roadsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 17 july 2018","story":"US President Donald Trump throws to his wife (unseen) a ball of the 2018 football World Cup that he received from Russia\u0027s President as a present during a joint press conference after a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland.

Currently Japanese car makers have 16 research and development centres, and 14 factories, inside the EU employing 34,000 people directly and supporting another 127,000 jobs.But the car companies’ operations across national borders within the bloc could be hampered by Brexit, another expert said.World news in picturesPresident Barack Obama delivers the 16th Nelson Mandela annual lecture, marking the centenary of the anti-apartheid leader\u0027s birth, in Johannesburg, South AfricaFrench supporters celebrate on the Champs Elysees their team\u0027s victory after the World Cup 2018 final between France and CroatiaHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point.

Dani, Wes, Laura and EyalWith the other contestants spreading rumours and stirring trouble, Jack was finally swayed by new girl Stephanie. Taking Old Laura (not a comment on her age, I hasten to add) to the exact same spot where Wes dumped her, he sat her down for a classic Love Island chat.Sitting in Dump Corner (an unfortunate name that we’re going to stick with), Jack broke the news to a quivering Laura that it was over. Taking it like an absolute champ, Jack strolled off into the sunset - presumably to find out what Stephanie was up to - leaving Laura alone once again.Love Island\u0027s Montana Brown reveals insider secrets about villa lifeLove Island\u0027s Frankie responds to news Samira quit to be with himOfcom receive 630 complaints over Love Island\u0027s treatment of LauraWe’re now left with an awful lot of singletons, which can only mean it’s going to be a dramatic week in the villa.You can catch up with everything that went on in the episode as it happened below.Please allow the\u0026nbspliveblog\u0026nbspa moment to load...Happy Tuesday everybody! Just a few hours to go until tonight\u0027s\u0026nbspLove Island.\u0026nbspIn case you missed it, Charlie and Ellie are the latest islanders to be kicked out, to the disappointment of...well nobody really.Somewhat impressively, Georgia has managed to single handedly\u0026nbspsplit the internet in two. Like Barack Obama looking through a window at some children, she has broken Twitter.\u0026nbspLet\u0027s break the warring factions down. On one side we have Team Georgia, and the other we have...well, Team Anti-Georgia.\u0026nbspTAG are judging Georgia for deciding to breakup with Sam and stay in the villa (therefore still in with a shot at the £50k, even though we know that money is obviously Dani Dyer\u0027s). They think she should\u0027ve left the villa in a display of undying love for Sam. TG, however, are rallying online to her defence, saying that Georgia in fact wanted to leave in a move of dignity, and it was actually Sam who convinced her. TG also say\u0026nbspshe has been a victim of harsh editing (remember Samira, anybody?).\u0026nbspSo which team are you on?Four new Islanders entered the villa last night. First up we have 23-year-old Stephanie Lam, who I must admit made so little impact I can\u0027t remember anything else about her.Our last two new contestants are Paul Knops (who was, fun fact, in Britney\u0027s\u0026nbspMake Me video, so he is obviously now our favourite) and DJ and model Josh Mair.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think I realised quite how many DJs and models there are in the world until I watched\u0026nbspLove Island.Apparently s*** is going to hit the fan for Jack and Laura tonight which is not good news. Mainly because I don\u0027t know how much longer I can watch that man pretend he cares about any of this.With £ signs in their eyes, Georgia and Sam made the brave decision to end their blossoming relationship in the pursuit of cash love.\u0026nbspSam has already had a successful date with new contestant Laura, but will Georgia have her head turned tonight?It seems ITV2 appears some viewers\u0026nbspare having streaming issues. Although unconfirmed, several people have reported issues with accessing the channel on ITV Player. We\u0027ll let you know if there are any updates on this.Rumour has it that Dr Alex might be tempted by one of the new women tonight. You are finally settled down Dr Alex, don\u0027t ruin it when the end is so tantalizingly near!Here we go! Let\u0027s begin tonight\u0027s\u0026nbspLove Island...Oh so \u0027loyal\u0027 Georgia has brought over two women over to the firepit for a heart to heart chat.Laura says if it was her and Jack, she would have left. Brutal Laura, brutal.And here comes the drama. Laura says if she was in Georgia\u0027s position, she would have left the villa in a show of love for Jack. He, however, has other ideas (mainly £50k) and secretly said he would stay.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn usual Laura style, she is absolutely furious and has stormed off from the firepit of doom.Poor old Sam is regretting his decision already, saying he can\u0027t talk to the new girls (is that code for I don\u0027t fancy any of them?)Jack is backtracking on everything he said, pleading with ever-furious Laura that he was only comforting Sam. Yeah right mate, you\u0027d drop Laura like a hot cake if the opportunity arose.Now we have new boy Josh who says my type is nice eyes, nice teeth and all the right curves.\u0026nbspI think I was just sick in my mouth new Josh.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is just one kilometre in size, and is flying in the opposite direction to many of the planet’s moons – and behaves in an entirely different way to any of the other 78 objects orbiting the planet.As such, it might be responsible for having smashed up many of the other objects that make up the moons around Jupiter. Scientists think the vast number of objects orbiting the planet are probably the result of collisions earlier in its life, which have been captured by Jupiter and now continue to orbit it.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Scientists expect there are probably around 100 different objects in total.All of the new moons around Jupiter are less than two miles wide. That accounts for why they had been left undiscovered until now, when scientists found them using incredibly sensitive telescopes.The team behind the discovery also found the most distant known object in our solar system – and suggested there might be a mysterious planet, a\u0026nbspPlanet X or Planet Nine, hiding out in the depths of our solar system. The new discovery was made almost by accident as researchers were hunting for more evidence of that world beyond Pluto.“Jupiter just happened to be in the sky near the search fields where we were looking for extremely distant solar system objects, so we were serendipitously able to look for new moons around Jupiter while at the same time looking for planets at the fringes of our solar system,” said Sheppard.Finding how the objects came to be formed and orbit around Jupiter could shed light on the formation of our own solar system. For instance, the new moons are so small that they would be influenced by any gas and dust around the planet – the fact they have managed to survive suggests they formed after the\u0026nbsprotating disk\u0026nbspof gas and dust that surrounded the sun formed into planets.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So much nicer than the aggressive-sounding ‘Allahu Akhbar.’\u0026nbspOr is that just my cultural upbringing?”Richard Dawkins complains people keep thinking he’s Stephen HawkingRichard Dawkins hits back at allegations he is IslamophobicRichard Dawkins asks police to arrest him for blasphemyThe Arabic phrase “Allahu Akbar” is used at the beginning of the “azaan”, or call to prayer, and means “God is greatest.When asked to clarify his comments, Mr Dawkins told The Independent the call to prayer could be\u0026nbsp“very beautiful… but also, ‘Allahu Akhbar’ is the last thing you hear before the suicide bomb goes off”.Some responded to Mr Dawkins’s post by saying his tweet “smacks of intolerance” and calling it “prejudiced”, while one person branded the author of The God Delusion\u0026nbspa “tedious old racist”.“The bells of Winchester sound glorious, as does the call to prayer by a muizzen. The only aggressive, unpleasant sound is this prejudiced tweet as I read the words in my head,” one said.“Turns out The God Delusion\u0026nbspwas just the collective insistence that Richard Dawkins was a philosopher and not just a tedious old racist,” another added.One Twitter user said: “As a number of people said at the time The God Delusion was published, Dawkins’ atheism is intellectually flawed and often simply a vehicle for a suburban conservatism that is run through with a dangerous and aggressive Islamophobia that he passes off as a neutral ‘reason’.”Another tweet said: “Sorry Richard. This smacks of intolerance. You should know better.”Others said Mr Dawkins was ignorant about the Muslim call to prayer and told him to listen to it more closely.“Sir, I don’t think it’s your cultural upbringing. I think you genuinely have no clue what the azaan is or how it sounds. Fine to me if you don’t like it but to qualify this as sounding ‘aggressive’\u0026nbspis just really, really silly,” one said.Another added: “I have the same relationship with it as you have with the ‘Bells of Winchester’ but what you suggested here is ignorant and flat out wrong. As an atheist, you should stop this ironic dance of hate on the lines between religions.”Another said: “As a Christian from a mixed Christian-Muslim country, it *is* your cultural upbringing. And it only sounds aggressive because you never bothered to learn more than English in your life.”Last year, Mr Dawkins defended himself from accusations of “Islamophobia” after a US radio station, KPFA Radio in Berkeley,\u0026nbspcancelled his appearance.In an open letter to the organisers, he insisted he had “never used abusive speech against Islam”.Instead, he said his remarks had been directed at Islamism, a term used to cover both political Islam and Islamic fundamentalism.When asked to respond to critics who accused him of intolerance, Mr Dawkins\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspThe Independent: “Church bells are beautiful. The muezzin’s call to prayer can also be very beautiful if recited in a good voice.“But also, ‘Allahu Akhbar’\u0026nbspis the last thing you hear before the suicide bomb goes off.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We are still asking people to use water wisely.There was a short spell of rain and showers \u0026ndash but United Utilities have brought the ban into force to conserve supplies and ensure that people \u0026ldquowere using water wisely.On average, it costs around \u0026pound1.50 worth of water, per hour, to hydrate a garden using a hosepipe.PAIn 1976, Staines Reservoirs, which normally hold 350million gallons, had reduced to just 17millionIn contrast to this, using a watering can is cheaper and although more labour intensive, will cost around 50p per hour to use.Last week, south eastern water company Thames Water told Express that running a hosepipe for an hour would use, on average, the same amount of water used by a family of four in an entire day.And if the nationwide ban comes into place,people up and down the country will be subject to \u0026pound1,000 fines.Water Services Regulation Authority (OFWAT) head, Rachel Fletcher, echoed the drought of 1976 by urging families to switch to other sources in a bid to save water, including recycled water from bathtubs and tanks that capture rainfall.Meanwhile, a hosepipe ban has already been put in place in Northern Ireland this year \u0026ndash the first such ban in 23 years."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/974785_1.jpg","title":"national lottery win west yorkshire lotto raffle prize","story":"But had the other shopper at the Tesco Extra store not let him go f rst, Mr Walshaw believes he would not have had time to play.He said: \u0026ldquoWe had a free Lucky Dip ticket from the previous draw to use and I knew it was only minutes until the draw closed.

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first ever officially identified British meteotsunami hit the Cornish coastline in June 2011.British researchers first became aware of the meteotsunami after people walking across St Michaels Mount causeway suddenly found themselves standing in water.Andrew Sibley, of the Met Office, said: The updrafts and downdrafts within a thunderstorm can create small and short-lived pressure changes, leading to initially small sea waves.These waves can then be amplified dramatically by resonance between the speed of the thunderstorm system and the speed of the wave if they are in phase.The speed of the sea wave is related to the sea depth. Such waves can also be funneled by coastal bays, estuaries and inlets.Professor David Tappin of the British Geological Survey added: Most tsunamis are geological, where you have a vertical movement on the seabed which can be caused by an earthquake, like in Japan in 2011, or a landslide.Meteotsunamis, however, are created by weather. You need a small, rapid change in atmospheric pressure of just a few millibars, if you get one of these then it can change the sea surface elevation by a few centimetres.In the deep ocean this would not be noticeable but when it enters shallow water whilst the weather system is moving at the same speed then the sea level increases by several metres."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420905377-e1531774409462.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit card is already on the table for theresa may the widely misunderstood wto","story":"In particular, by tying us into EU regulatory standards on goods, it would make it difficult to secure Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, including the United States.Nevertheless, you could argue that this minimal Brexit is better than nothing, and some Leavers have. But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up.

Basel 1A’ is a literary text and is more valuable.She added: We can now say that it’s a medical text that describes the phenomenon of ‘hysterical apnea’, (therefore) we assume that it is either a text from the Roman physician Galen or an unknown commentary of work”.Hysterical apnea, better known today as hysteria suffocation, had been previously mentioned by Galen in other texts.His extraordinary claim theorised that women could suffer hysterical apnea if they stopped having sexual intercourse, an affliction clearly not recognised by modern doctors.Despite this, Galen is remembered as one of greatest scholars of antiquity, particularly in modern medicine.Galen’s belief was very similar to that of Hippocrates, “The Father of Medicine”, who was the first to coin the term hysteria.Hippocrates unusual theory believed that hysteria came from a female uterus that was deprived of moisture, which should have been received through intercourse.He called this condition the wandering womb, which if unhappy as a result of this would float around the upper abdomen triggering “stiff breathing and sharp pains in the heart”, according to the text of his ‘Diseases of Women”.Galen advanced this theory further. Whilst he disagreed that the womb wandered, he believed that the hysteria was caused by the retention of an apparent female seed, which would turn poisonous if not released through regular intercourse.His recommendation to curing this was the hastening of marriage, with the implication that regular sex would cure women of hysteria.This theory has of course been debunked by modern medicine. It was not until Sigmund Freud in the 19th Century determined that hysteria was not exclusive to women but could also affect men, and was determined by upbringing, education and social interaction.In time, the focus on hysteria being a condition determined by sexual intercourse disintegrated within Western society. It was not until 1980 that hysteria was no longer diagnosed as a mental disorder."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421066404.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"londoner moves welsh woodland hobbit house ebay","story":"Kris Harbour owned two properties and enjoyed a bustling social life but decided to quit his job as a lift engineer in the heart of the capital three years ago.The 31-year-old said the daily commute and financial strain of living in London left him feeling tired and unfulfilled.He sold his house and buy-to-let flat to close his £400,000 mortgages and used the money he gained to buy a 18.5 acre plot of land in South Wales he found on eBay.After around 18 months of building the £4,000 building from natural materials, Kris says he is happier than hes ever been.He said: My family thought it was probably a little bit crazy. n the surface of everything I was doing quite well.

Mid-afternoon will see sunshine and isolated showers.“Temperatures in London with reach 26C, 22C in Cardiff and 20C in Glasgow with Belfast slightly warmer with 21C.“Thursday will be a dry day for most parts with a chance of showers in the east.“North West Scotland will be cloudy with rain late in the afternoon.“Glasgow will once again see temperatures of 20C while London could reach 28C or even 29C. Cardiff will see temperatures of 23C and 21C in Belfast.“As the weekend approaches there will be a two-way split between the south and south east and the north west.“The north west will be cloudy and see a little bit of rain in the most northerly regions.“The south and south east will remain largely dry and sunny for most and see a return of more humid conditions.”The Sun previously revealed how United Utilities was “days away” from a ban as reservoir levels in the North West were dangerously low.The ban restricts the use of hosepipes or sprinklers for watering private gardens and washing private cars.Customers will still be able to water their gardens with a watering can and wash their vehicles using a bucket and sponge, the firm said.It is the first water company to announce plans for a hosepipe ban. Demand has almost doubled in the last week with billions of litres of water being used on a daily basis by gasping homeowners.United Utilities director Martin Padley said: “Despite recent rain, reservoir levels are still lower than we expect.“Unless we get a period of sustained rainfall before August 5 these restrictions will help us safeguard essential water supplies.”United is said to waste 430million litres of water a day with leaks. GMB union chief Stuart Fegan said: “It’s a disgrace.”Paul Hickey, head of water resources, at the Environment Agency said: “Over two very dry months, we have seen a rapid decline in reservoir levels in the North West and we support the announcement by United Utilities to manage water supplies by introducing household restrictions.“Across the rest of England, most groundwater supplies are at healthy levels and water companies have enough water to maintain supplies if resources are managed properly.“Many rivers around the country have dropped to lower levels than normal for this time of year, which can be damaging to wildlife.We have robust plans in place to respond to these pressures and have stepped up our incident response as well as regulation of those abstracting water to ensure the environment is protected.“We are meeting with affected groups including farmers to provide practical advice about conserving water and planning for prolonged dry weather.We encourage everyone to use water wisely to conserve supplies and protect the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421102870.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kids playground vandalised glass shards","story":"Unruly teenagers have plagued the play area in Bramley Rise, Beccles, Suffolk, known as Chicken Hill park with intimidating behaviour and messing up the area.Youngsters are now said to be too frightened to play there.Beccles Bombles, the town’s volunteer litter picking group, cleaned up the area last week so kids could once again enjoy the various bit of apparatus.They also stuck up anti-littering signs as a way to deter any repeat behaviour.But just one week one and the signs have been torn down, ripped up and burnt and the piles of bottles, cans and cigarette ends have returned.Caroline Topping, who helped set up the volunteer group, told the Eastern Daily Press: “Literally one week on and there is a lot of litter all over again - it’s our worst spot in the whole town.“There is broken glass below the play equipment and at the bottom of the slide and patches of grass which have been set on fire.“The children who should be using the slide are literally going to lacerate their legs and arms on the glass.”Topping, who is also a Waveney district councillor, added she had also spoken to two young girls who said they were too frightened to play there.She said: “The teenagers are down there every night.

And it said the DWP should provide a figure for the total amount claimants have missed out on, along with an explanation of how it will provide “appropriate remedies”.The committee said: “There is clearly much more to be done to right this wrong. We encourage the department to act swiftly, decisively and comprehensively to address the harm caused by this mistake and, more broadly, to give much greater priority to correcting benefit underpayments to vulnerable people.”Those affected were people whose ability to work is affected by disability or illness, who were transferred from the old incapacity benefit on to ESA from 2011 onwards. Some 70,000 ended up being underpaid for years, losing an average of £5,000, found the report. Of these, more than 20,000 of those most in need are owed around £11,500 each and some as much as £20,000.The report found that the “unacceptable and entirely avoidable” situation came about because of “multiple failures” by the DWP. The department failed to listen to staff, claimants or experts when they warned that things were going wrong and failed to scrutinise its own processes properly or to ensure that they reflected the legislation, said the committee.And a “culture of indifference” at the department meant it took more than six years to take action, even though it was “painfully obvious” that a significant number of claimants were being underpaid.“Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of Government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA,” said Ms Hillier.“The department simply didn’t listen to what claimants, experts, support organisations and its own staff were saying. Its sluggishness in correcting underpayments, years after it accepted responsibility for the error, points to weaknesses at the highest levels of management. Indifference has no place in the delivery of vital public services. It must be rooted out wherever it is found.“The department needs to explain what it is doing to improve both its management culture and its ability to gather and act promptly on critical intelligence.“It must also set out how it will more quickly address the £1.7 billion of underpayments claimants miss out on each year.”A DWP spokesman said: “We take the issue of underpayments very seriously and have actively taken steps to put this right as quickly as possible, to ensure people get the support they are entitled to. We have recruited 400 extra staff and have already started making payments - over £40 million so far. We have continued to provide regular updates to both the PAC and the House in regards to the progress of these repayments, and will continue in this stead.”In a separate development, the chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee wrote to employment minister Alok Sharma to raise concerns over benefit sanctions data supplied by the DWP.Frank Field said that the department’s published data “consistently understate” the sanctions applied to claimants by removing those who have successfully appealed against decisions.And he queried the decision to sanction 1,108 Universal Credit claimants in February alone despite them being judged medically unfit to work or look for work.“What is the point of applying sanctions to people who cannot work and are not expected to look for jobs?” asked Mr Field. Benefit sanctions are the only major welfare reform this decade to have never been evaluated, and the picture DWP paints of the policy doesn’t match the troubling stories we’ve heard.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An independent panel later cleared him of the allegation and no further action was taken. Furious constituents have called for Griffiths to step down as an MP after he admitted to bombarding a pair of female constituents with sleazy messages. And today it emerged he had been accused by a Conservative councillor of being “very forward”, after he allegedly touched her knee and clutched her waist at a fundraising ball in September 2016. The councillor, Deneice Florence-Jukes, made a written complaint to Tory HQ, claiming she had been “completely humiliated and bullied” by Griffiths over several months, according to the . The complaint was reportedly referred to the party’s newly founded sexual harassment hotline in November last year. Mr Griffiths was made Minister for Small Business on January 10, while the investigation was still ongoing.  The inquiry was not dismissed until February, after Griffiths claimed it was “implausible” for him to have touched a colleague’s knee in a room full of people. He was cleared of wrongdoing. The alleged incident was initially reported to Richard Grosvenor, the Tory leader of East Staffordshire Borough Council. He told the Mirror: “Andrew’s got a problem which he’s seeking help for. I’ve got nothing but sympathy and compassion for him in that problem.” Mr Grosvenor said he had met with Ms Florence-Jukes after she made the allegation, saying she was in “floods of tears”. But referring to last weekend\u0027s sex texts revelations, he said Griffiths’ behaviour was “completely wrong” and he should step down as an MP. He said: “I do think Andrew has to consider his position. I don’t see how he can hope to meet with residents in a constituency MP capacity now.

The Prime Minister survived a bid by pro-EU MPs in her own party to change its post-Brexit trade strategy. They wanted the UK to join a customs union in the event it did not agree a free-trade deal with the EU. But on an evening of high drama in the House of Commons, MPs voted against the proposed amendment to the Trade Bill tabled by Tory MP Stephen Hammond. The Government scraped through by just 307 to 301 votes . Mrs May says a customs union would stop the UK from striking new trade deals. The win came thanks to Brexiteer Labour MPs Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann and Graham Stringer siding with her. Had they voted against the Government, it would have triggered the vote of no confidence. Tory Brexiteer Nadine Dorries said tonight: “If Labour rebels hadn’t stepped in tonight, our own 12 Remain rebels would have lost us that vote.”  She added the third reading of the Trade Bill would have been “pulled” and a confidence vote would have been called tonight. This could have led to a general election within weeks – the third since 2015. Pro-EU Labour MP Chuka Umunna blasted the Labour four. He said: “It’s very disappointing and our communities will question why Labour MPs are jeopardising jobs.” Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said Brexit had “sunk further into the Westminster quagmire”. She said: “Parliament is deeply divided on Brexit and the Government are struggling to get anything passed. The only way forward is to put this issue to the public.” And Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mrs May’s Chequers negotiating strategy was now “in tatters”.  He added: “The passing of this deeply flawed bill can’t mask the profound splits at the heart of the Tory party.” Twelve Tory rebels broke ranks to back the customs union measure, even though it is understood Tory whips told would-be rebels of the confidence vote plan if it passed. In dramatic scenes in the Commons, ministers made a last-ditch effort to stave off defeat by offering to introduce amendments in the House of Lords. They said these would deal with “the essence” of rebel Tories’ concerns over future customs arrangements.  Mr Field, Ms Hoey, Mr Mann and Mr Stringer, along with independent MP Kelvin Hopkins, voted with the Government. Former Tory Defence Minister Guto Bebb, who only quit on Monday in protest at Government concessions to hard Brexit Tories, was among the 12 who rebelled. He was joined by Heidi Allen, Kenneth Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Phillip Lee, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. But despite her customs win, Mrs May faced humiliation as she lost two other battles. She had to ditch her bid to send MPs home early for summer after facing widespread fury. The Prime Minister had deployed the extraordinary tactic of bringing forward recess by five days in a bid to kill off threats to her premiership.  But Tory MP Nick Boles said: “There could hardly be a worse time to vote to start recess early.” And a Labour source said: “The Tories tried to save the PM’s skin with this Westminster ruse, but they have been forced into an embarrassing climbdown. That they even considered it shows what a shambles they’re in. This is Government in name only.” The Government also lost a separate vote on its Trade Bill on the regulation of medicines after Brexit. MPs backed an amendment by 305 to 301 that requires Mrs May to ensure the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.

Shambles is an overused word in politics, but over the past week the Tories have brought a whole new meaning to the word. At the start of the month, Cabinet ministers travelled to the Prime Minister’s country retreat finally to discuss their plan for Brexit. It had taken the Government two years to get that point. The plan then unravelled within a matter of days. Senior members of the Government resigned. Theresa May then sided with Jacob Rees-Mogg to kill it off.  And to top it all off, she tried to order her MPs to go home early for summer to avoid any further embarrassment. It would be funny if it wasn’t so serious. The question then turns to what Labour think of the Government’s plan. On that I have a very clear message for Theresa May – if you think Labour will support your fatally flawed Chequers’ agreement, then you have another thing coming. No ifs, no buts. Let me equally clear to Mirror readers – this is not about blocking Brexit or frustrating the process. We respect the result of the referendum and recognise we are leaving the EU. When we campaigned two years ago we did so on the basis that a vote to leave would mean leave - just as a vote to remain would have meant remain. But, we will not give this Prime Minister – or indeed any Tory Prime Minister – a blank cheque to harm British business, to put jobs at risk, to undermine people’s rights or to threaten the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland.

The new code states explicitly that “anti-Semitism is racism” and it is “unacceptable”, but stops short of signing up in full to the definition drawn up by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA).  At a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday, MPs and peers overwhelmingly backed calls for the full wording to be adopted.  Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis warned that adopting the code would “send an unprecedented message of contempt to the Jewish community”. But Labour’s National Executive Committee signed off the code at a meeting on Tuesday. Members agreed, however, to re-open the development of the policy in recognition of the “serious concerns” raised. Labour former leader Ed Miliband said the party should adopt the full definition.  He said: “The argument that it is somehow incompatible with criticising the actions of the Israeli government is wrong. “The views of the vast majority of the Jewish community are very clear. I would urge the NEC to get on with this at speed.”  Chief Rabbi warns Labour’s new guidelines on anti-Semitism place it on the ‘wrong side of the fight’ against racism and intolerance Labour officials drew up the code in the wake of protests by Jewish groups outside Parliament earlier this year. It states that criticism of the state of Israel and its policies should not automatically be regarded as anti-Semitic, and makes clear that even “contentious” comments on this issue “will not be treated as anti-Semitism unless accompanied by specific anti-Semitic content ... or by other evidence of anti-Semitic intent”. The code explicitly endorses the IHRA’s working definition of anti-Semitism and includes a list of behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic copied word-for-word from the international organisation’s own document. But it omits four examples from the IHRA list.  These include accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country, claiming that Israel’s existence as a state is a racist endeavour, requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis. Labour insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered in the new code. In a statement, the Jewish Labour Movement said: “The Labour Party has acted in a deliberate and offensive reckless manner in believing it understands the needs of a minority community better than the community itself.”  Labour Against Antisemitism said it was looking at its legal options and would be making a formal complaint to the party. Spokesman Euan Philipps said: “The message sent by the NEC is loud and clear: the Labour movement has lost its moral compass, appears to have an institutional anti-Semitism issue and can no longer claim to represent the values of solidarity, justice and equality.

Not only that, but two years since Vote Leave inched their way to victory the topic still somehow has the power to wrong-foot people when talking about it. Even BBC News hosts can come unstuck.  Victoria Derbyshire\u0027s BBC show had political commentator Alex Spence appear to discuss whether Brexit negotiations were being dragged out and taking too long.   Defending the lengthy and complex process of triggering Article 50 , Spence said:   Forty years we\u0027ve been intertwined with the European Union and you’re not going to disentangle that overnight. I always personally thought it would take many many years to sort out. Fair enough. But it was at this point that Victoria made a rather embarrassing blunder. And it wasn\u0027t anything to do with the minutiae of our transition period or disenchantment with Theresa May\u0027s deal.  Instead, it was over Spence\u0027s accent.   He continued: And then the actual process by which we have to leave the EU under Article 50, that’s two years and you have to go through that. So, it feels to all of us like it’s taking a long time but it was always going to take this long. Victoria then said: You say \u0027we\u0027. You\u0027re originally from Australia. This forced Spence to respond, rather awkwardly, and say he was actually from New Zealand...  It\u0027s a mistake many of us make. But, clearly embarrassed, Victoria apologised profusely, saying: I\u0027m so sorry. Oh my gosh. Wow. I am so sorry. How long have you lived in Britain, do you mind me asking? But this seemed to just have a hole-digging effect.

But the couple failed to get inside the maternity ward and Kara ended up delivering her baby in the car park, Nottinghamshire Live reports.    Mrs Lee, a stay-at-home mum, said: It was one of my son\u0027s graduation from nursery , so we went along to that.  I had a few cramps at this point but they were quite far apart. I think maybe an hour after we got to the nursery I was giving birth - it all happened so quickly.

As I got into the car my waters broke and as we pulled into the car park I couldn\u0027t move as her head was coming out. It all happened so fast and I think I was just in shock. At 3.07pm their baby daughter Kaitlyn was born, weighing 8lb 4oz. Mr Lee, an electrician, said: She had contractions that were half an hour apart and you are told not to go into hospital until they are five to ten minutes apart but that just happened so quickly.

But parents face a 25% hike in prices if they still want to put the veg and salad staples on plates. Figures from purchasing company Beacon reveal farmers are facing a struggle to meet demand as the unusually high temperatures have wreaked havoc with crops. And cauliflower could also be hit as the scorching summer continues. Beacon managing director Paul Connelly said: “Although Brits might be enjoying the hot weather, our fresh produce definitely is not, with suppliers noting a decrease in quality stock, and therefore supply, which could see prices rise by 25%.  “With a simple summer salad a great dining choice in the hot weather, we may see an impact to consumers in the months to come if the sizzling summer continues, demand for produce increases and reduced supplies continue.” The predicted price rise follows reports that Britain also faces a pea shortage as the heat and lack of water is killing the growth and quality of pea pods. Stephen Francis, managing director of frozen supplier Fen Peas said: “It’s too late to rescue a lot of our peas, they overexerted themselves searching for water that’s not there. “All of our locations are harvesting below average. If we have rainfall now it wouldn’t be able to reverse the effects.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kelloggs slashes amount sugar best","story":"NewsKellogg\u0027s slashes amount of sugar in best seller Coco Pops by 40%The revamped recipe, which also has 10% less salt, now has 17g of sugar per 100g rather than 30g\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRuki SayidConsumer Editor20:49, 17 JUL 2018NewsKellog\u0027s says it took three-and-a-half years to come up with its new recipe\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKellogg’s has slashed the amount of sugar in its Coco Pops breakfast cereal by 40%. The revamped recipe, which also has 10% less salt, now has 17g of sugar per 100g rather than 30g. Levels were already cut by 14% this year. It puts the brand ahead of Government’s goal of 20% less sugar in cereal and snacks by 2020. Bridget Briggs, of Kellogg’s, said: “We have listened to people who buy Coco Pops. We have taken sugar out and added more cocoa. We haven’t used artificial colours, sweeteners or preservatives.”  Kellogg’s said it took three-and-a-half years to reformulate the recipe, which in taste tests 85% of children said they liked as much. It is out this week, and may save Coco the monkey. MPs want a ban on characters plugging unhealthy food. Health campaigners urged others to follow Kellogg’s lead.

Yet instead of walking out on Anastasia \u0026shyPomiateeva, the 44-year-old astonishingly stood by his partner of nine years. But even worse was to come for Gary when dad Stephen suffocated his 62-year-old wife Anne after a blazing row over the secret fling. After the former UKIP councillor was today found guilty of murder, his son spoke about how the tangled web of infidelity, lies and tragedy ended with him and Anastasia forming a stronger bond than they had before.  Gary, who has disowned his scheming dad, said of the affair: “When I found out it was \u0026shyheartbreaking. I just couldn’t believe the man I absolutely \u0026shyidolised and worshipped had done something like that to me. “But me and Anastasia just love each other so much that if anything this has brought us closer together. We will be together for the rest of our lives, until we are old and grey. We have all done things in our lives we are not proud of. “At the end of the day we had already been through so much together.  “If this doesn’t break us we can overcome anything together. I haven’t got an old man any more for obvious reasons. “When my mum died I just felt numb. I had not only lost my mum but also my father as well, he was my best friend. “I would have done anything for him, it’s a huge betrayal.” Anastasia, who claimed Searle pursued her relentlessly until she gave in to his sordid advances, added: “I was relieved when it came out. I felt so ashamed and guilty. I want us to rebuild now the trial is over. Time is a healer.” The couple decided to speak out after being approached by the Daily Mirror.  Former Royal Marine Searle met Anastasia in 2005 when they worked together at Solar Bowl bowling alley where he was manager. In 2009 she began a relationship with Gary, after he also got a job there. The couple had three children and Anastasia was treated as a daughter-in-law by Searle and Anne. In March last year Searle invited her for coffee at his UKIP office in the council building at Ipswich, Suffolk. During the visit he told her he had not had sex for six years and asked if she would like to “make him happy”. Anastasia, who was born in Britain but has a Russian father, refused and left. But dad-of-three Searle continued harassing her – using bodybuilding pictures from his youth – and in April she “relented”.  Anastasia said: “When he approached me I was shocked and surprised. But at the time I was very vulnerable because my nan was really unwell in hospital. “I had always been \u0026shyintimidated by him as he’s very powerful, controlling and manipulative. “I was a prat to give in but he took advantage of my vulnerability and I felt sorry for him.” The fling began when Anastasia visited Searle at his family home in Stowmarket. She said he gave her the nickname SBG – short for Steve’s Beautiful Girl. The lovers exchanged explicit pictures and texts. Anastasia added: “Whenever I tried to break it off he said that he needed me. I felt dirty, I always had to have a shower straight after meeting him.”  The two-month affair ended last June when suspicious Anne guessed her husband’s phone PIN was 4545 – after he served in 45 Commando – and spotted the exchanges. She discovered they were trying to arrange a hotel meeting and confronted Searle. Giving evidence at Ipswich crown court during his trial, he said: “I was a stupid old sod and made a massive mistake. “I totally admitted everything. She [Anne] was extremely upset, that goes without saying.” Anastasia confessed everything to Gary. She said: “I wanted him to know the truth, I wanted him to know everything.”  The court heard that the messy affair ripped the Searle family apart. Gary, who has two brothers, Stephen Jr, 29, and 41-year-old \u0026shyChristopher, broke off contact with his dad. But despite the turmoil he caused, \u0026shydetermined Searle continued trying to contact Anastasia, even “stalking her” and following her to \u0026shysupermarkets and baby groups. She also found out he had been obsessed with her for years, even compiling a sick photo collection on his computer. Anastasia said: “He had pictures of me from before I met Gary stored on his computer. “He had downloaded them from Facebook and superimposed my head on to the bodies of porn stars. I was scared of him. Me and Gary changed our numbers to stop him contacting us.”  The court heard Searle’s fling with Anastasia led to tragedy on December 30 last year, when Searle had the murderous row with Anne. After smothering his wife of 45 years, he phoned police and told them: “I’ve just killed my wife.” He claimed he strangled sushi factory worker Anne in self-defence after she attacked him with a steak knife at their \u0026pound320,000 home. But jurors rejected his concocted story and took just three and a half hours to convict him of murdering her with a choke hold he learned during military training. Searle, recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, held his head in his hands following the verdict. He had asked to attend today’s sentencing hearing via videolink from HMP Norwich, complaining about the “unpleasant” prison van journey. But the judge insisted he be in court. Searle, who had a nine-year military career, will be jailed for life on Wednesday at Ipswich.

Last week eagle-eyed fashion fans poured over her four fabulous outfits during their whirlwind tour of Ireland. Today they can\u0027t help but admire her pink trench coat dress by House of Nonie. The \u0026pound623 sleeveless dress has captured the attention of many, and not just because she looks gorgeous in it. Meghan\u0027s dress is gaining attention because it\u0027s the latest in a string of blush coloured outfits the Duchess has worn since marrying Prince Harry. In fact, it is the fifth time she\u0027s worn pink.  She has previously worn similar shades to events such as Trooping the Colour, Prince Charles\u0027 70th birthday party, the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards and to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday. Experts have highlighted the shift in her wardrobe, pointing out how before becoming a Duchess, Meghan opted for darker, bolder colours. However she has noticeably started wearing more neutral, softer tones - and there\u0027s an interesting reason why.   Colour psychologist, Karen Haller, told MailOnline that the colour is calming.  She said: The number of high profile engagements Meghan has had since officially becoming a member of the royal family would no doubt be quite nerve wracking. As the softer end of the pink spectrum is physically soothing, it\u0027s the perfect antidote to calming those nerves and easing the pulse rate.  Karen added that the colour could also reflect Meghan\u0027s feelings for Harry. Soft pinks communicate the nurturing, compassionate, caring side of love, she said. I\u0027m not at all surprised she is feeling this way given the body language between her and Prince Harry - and she is reflecting this in picking the softer pinks.

No other planet in the Solar System has so many satellites. One of the 12 is described by scientists as an oddball because of its unusual and risky orbit. The renegade moon has an inclined orbit that crosses those of others moving in the opposite direction, greatly increasing the possibility of a collision. This is an unstable situation, said US astronomer Dr Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, who led the discovery team.  A head-on collision between two moons would grind the objects down to dust, he added. Nine of the new moons belong to an outer retrograde swarm circling against the direction of Jupiter\u0027s rotation. Others including the oddball are prograde moons travelling with the planet\u0027s spin. The oddball is thought to be Jupiter\u0027s smallest moon, having a diameter of less than a kilometre. Scientists believe it could be the last remaining remnant of a once larger moon that was involved in past collisions. The name Valetudo has been suggested for it, after the Roman god Jupiter\u0027s great-granddaughter, the goddess of health and hygiene.

Leighanne Bromley, 29, was appalled to overhear staff members at RNIB Three Spires Academy in Coventry mocking her son and sharing cruel jokes. She had called the school to notify them that her 10-year-old son would be off that day as he had a cold, but wasn\u0027t prepared for the response that she got once the school thought they had hung up. Leighanne phoned the school on July 10 in the morning after her son Harley had complained he wasn\u0027t feeling well. Shortly after she saw she had a voicemail from the school after they had called back.  She said: I looked at my phone I saw I had a missed call from the school and they’d left the voicemail. “It was then I heard the message. My initial reaction was just shock. My jaw just hit the floor, I was stunned. I couldn’t make it out at first, so I had to listen to it over and over again. I was just in disbelief.” In the voicemail recording, a female member of staff can be heard asking when Harley would be returning to school. Appearing to think she had hung up the phone, she can then be heard saying ‘and make sure he’s off all f***king week’ while another voice asks ‘what about two weeks?’ The staff members can then be heard joking about the possibility of Harley being kept off for two weeks or until the end of the year. A final voice then makes reference to the upcoming summer holidays, retorting ‘don’t bring him back until the 27th of July when we are closed’. The retail worker and mum-of-one, from Cheylesmore, Coventry, said she is now fearful to send Harley back to the school and wants the staff members to be suspended.  Robert Jones, headteacher of Three Spires, where half of pupils have autistic spectrum conditions, has made a public apology to Leighanne today and has launched an investigation. Leighanne said she has never previously had problems with the school, which Harley has attended as a pupil for the last four and a half years. But she admitted recently she has felt staff were unsympathetic in dealing with Harley’s behavioural issues. Leighanne said Harley, who was diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder aged four-and-a-half in 2013 and has a developmental delay, is a “sweet” boy. She said: “When he first attended my impression was that it was a really good school and that he was progressing really well. “The school is good itself but there have been issue with the staff. They’ve had a few behavioural issues with Harley but they just don’t seem to have sympathetic. “I think the school have been weak in dealing with this. Obviously if I don’t get the outcome I’m looking for I might have to move him.

William Powner bullied, blackmailed and intimidated his nine victims, some as young as 12, so they felt forced to engage in sexual activity and send him pictures and videos of the intimate acts. Powner, of Fitzwaller Road, Woolston, Warrington, was just 13 when he began committing his cyber sex crime.  He was 17 upon his conviction and 18 when he was sentenced today. Powner, who was recently diagnosed with autism and Asperger\u0027s syndrome, avoided an immediate jail term.  He was made the subject of a 10 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order that means his behaviour will be monitored by the authorities, the Liverpool Echo reported.  The sex pest used Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat to snare his victims, with police estimating he was in touch with up to 85 separate children, Chester Crown Court heard. Describing some of the abuse, prosecutor Simon Parry said: The suspect [Powner] with his [computer] camera pane deactivated, will tell the victims that he is a female teenager. The suspect will engage in conversation and quickly turn it sexual. Requests are made for exposed chest and face shots, then footage of the victims’ penis and in return and only when this has been done will she return the ‘favour’ and show her face and body. There are many little comments of confidence, flattery and it can be seen that this is being done to ‘hook the victim in’. Once the victim had shown their genitalia or performed a sex act on camera, Mr Parry said, Powner turned nasty.  He would tell his victim the footage was recorded and he knew where they lived, and that if they did not do what he said the footage would be shared with teachers, parents, bullies, and friends. Mr Parry added: In a number of the files, the suspect coerces the victim to stand naked in the room, open their bedroom door and to call their mum up so he can watch it happen. The victims’ body language is completely revealing that he is now acting under extreme duress due to the threats. In another, the victim is made to carry his device downstairs, and whilst still naked, go outside into the back garden. Powner, who had no previous convictions, was also found to have a collection of indecent images of children, with 110 of the most serious Category A movie and photos, 137 in Category B and 73 in Category C.

Popular Charlie Dunne was enjoying a day out at Croyde Bay beach with friends and family - a day after celebrating the end of his A-Level exams and finishing Aylesbury Grammar School. But whilst on the beach, the former Tesco employee, who made headlines earlier this year when he found a rare Cadbury\u0027s Creme Egg, suffered a catastrophic injury and went into cardiac arrest that left him fighting for his life. The 18-year-old, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, was initially airlifted to North Devon District Hospital before being transferred to another in Plymouth. Two days later on the evening of July 11 his parents made the impossible decision to turn his life support off, as  reported yesterday.  A report from the opening of his inquest in Plymouth stated: “Charlie had arrived at Croyde Bay to join his family for a holiday. He quickly changed and joined his sister and family and friends to go bodyboarding. “He was in ankle deep water in a calm sea. He was holding his bodyboard with both hands when he fell. It is not known what caused Charlie to fall. “His sister and a lifeguard went to his aid.” The report added: “There are no suspicious circumstances. A full inquest will be held at a later date to establish the cause of his death.  The day before the tragic incident on July 9, Charlie had been partying with pals at a Leavers\u0027 Ball to mark the end of his exams and finishing Aylesbury Grammar School. He had ambitions to go to university and study the craft of watchmaking. The inquisitive young man and talented rugby player also made headlines earlier this year when he found a rare white Cadbury\u0027s Creme Egg - and bagged \u0026pound200 from it. He was on his way to a night out in Oxford with friends when he stopped the taxi and nipped into a nearby Co-Op for a snack. He told of how he wanted to save the money or \u0027put it towards a party holiday\u0027 to the likes of Magaluf or Ayia Napa before he started uni.  Charlie\u0027s former headmaster, Mark Sturgeon, broke the devastating news to students and parents this week and confirmed counselling is being offered. In a statement Mr Sturgeon said: It is with great sadness that we have to share with you the news that Charlie Dunne, one of our Year 13 students in Denson House, has died after suffering a terrible accident on a beach in North Devon, whilst on holiday. Charlie had recently completed his A levels. He attended the Leavers’ Ball on Sunday 8 July and then travelled to North Devon for a holiday with family and some friends. Whilst on the beach Charlie suffered a terrible accident that left him with a catastrophic injury to his vertebrae causing spinal injury and cardiac arrest. His family took the impossible decision to turn off the life support that had been assisting Charlie since the accident.  Charlie died on Wednesday evening 11 July 2018. Charlie was registered as an organ donor and we know there were three people waiting to receive major organs from him. There is some comfort in him living on in others and potentially transforming their lives. He added: Charlie was lively, inquisitive, friendly and helpful young man. He was always smiling, always happy and was well known across the whole school. His impact on Denson House, on the rugby squad and his friends cannot be underestimated and our thoughts and support are with the family and the whole Aylesburian community.

Pictures show the devastation caused by the searing rays of sun which were magnified on the decorative glass item and set fire to the curtains.  Now a new warning has been issued by firefighters to never leave ornaments in the window during a heatwave .  The fire ripped through the bungalow in Bognor Regis and was so fierce windows and glass ornaments exploded. The terrified OAP raised the alarm by pressing her lifeline button, which alerted the emergency services after spotting the fire while outside pottering in the garden. All of the pensioner\u0027s belongings were destroyed, except the board game Monopoly.  She said: It was the scariest situation that I have ever been in, the fire started and grew so quickly, within minutes the house was full of smoke with glass exploding and smoke everywhere. My whole house is fire and smoke damaged and at the present time, we are unable to live in the property. This week, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service warned others to remove the decorative items off windowsills in the hot weather to prevent another blaze. A spokesman said: On arrival, the crew were faced with a well-developed fire in the front of the property and requested assistance from a further two fire engines.

Some of these encounters - such as Robert Mugabe, Bashar al-Assad - have been divisive to say the least. Last week, Her Majesty once again had to shake hands with another controversial figure - Donald Trump. While our famously private Queen has to remain diplomatic and smilingly neutral at all times, she\u0027s still got her own subtle, shady ways of communicating her feelings.  And as Britain\u0027s longest-reigning monarch, she has this down to a fine art - you just have to know where to look for the signs. Luckily, thanks to brains behind Her Majesty\u0027s Jewllery Vault , eagle-eyed twitter user Julie spotted how the Queen (possibly) sent some powerful yet subtle messages to Trump during his visit using her brooches.  And these weren\u0027t I think you\u0027re great, Donny messages, either. No. The Queen of Shade? First, it\u0027s important to to realise the significance of brooches for the Queen. According to Julie, she gets them frequently as gifts and when she chooses to wear one on an official engagement, there is always a significance to the choice of brooch. While this can be a thoughtful or historically significant gesture, it can also be used to show, for example, disdain.  Julie explains: A head of state gives her a brooch? If they visit, she\u0027ll wear it or something else she\u0027d been given by them as a gift. (This goes for other kinds of jewelry too.) To her it\u0027s almost like royal orders. She continues: That said, she wore three brooches while she and Trump were both in town. The day he arrived, the day of the banquet, and the day she actually met him for tea. Possible snub number one? Arrival day was the one that got the most attention. That day, she wore the brooch the Obamas gave her on their last visit to England. Hmm, interesting. Now, this is potentially significant and a snub for the following reasons.   It was purchased out-of-pocket by Michelle and Barack Obama and given to her as a personal gift. According to Julie they chose a very modest pin made of very modest materials. The message is \u0027Here is a gift of something you like, with only sentimental value because it\u0027s for friendship not state visits.\u0027 The Queen has been given jewellery from the US over the years. But she chose the most SENTIMENTAL piece in the collection, the one that was given OUT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE OBAMAS AS PEOPLE.  Possible snub number two? The next day the Queen had an audience with the King and Queen of Belgium, for which she chose to wear a brooch gifted to her by Canada.    Julie goes on: You know, who Trump\u0027s been screaming about and insulting. The commonwealth country and one of the UK\u0027s greatest allies. Them. Coincidence? Maybe. But let\u0027s move on to the next brooch. Possible snub number three? On the day of her tea with Trump and Melania, the Queen chose a brooch she inherited from her mother.  Jewel watchers nearly died, because it is the brooch worn in the famous \u0027Three Queens in Mourning\u0027 photo, worn by the Queen Mum, Julie writes. QE rolled up to tea with the Trumps wearing the brooch her mother wore to her father\u0027s STATE FUNERAL. We know the Queen will use her handbag to send subtle messages.

Winny Stokes had 14 children who went on to have 34 of their own kids. And the latest arrival to the brood brings the number of grandchildren, great grandchildren and great great grandchildren to 66. It means Winny now has exactly 100 grandchildren. She hit three figures in the past few weeks when the latest member of her family, baby Hunter, arrived. Widow Winny, who was married to Ken, said her children would top and tail in bunk beds every night growing up - and they were all in bed by 7pm. It also meant family holidays to Blackpool required a 52-seater coach.  Winny, from Gloucester, said: “I just couldn’t believe it when I was told I had 100 grandchildren. “I had 14 children altogether. Sadly one of my children, John, died when he was just three hours old, and we lost Tony 13 years ago when he was 51 years old. “I married my husband Ken when I was about 20 years old and we lived with my mother and father but we had to move as there were five of us living in that house. \u0027\u0027We moved a short distance away.

Dad would always be ‘one up all up-do your jobs. “Dad would get all the get the children up on Sunday and they would get in the washroom. \u0027\u0027The cleanest children would go in the bath first, so the girls would go in first and the boys afterwards. “There was always moaning from one or the other complaining that they did not want to get in the bath with one of the others because they picked their nose or something.” "},{"url":null,"title":"you could over drink drive","story":"NewsYou could be over the drink drive limit if you have seconds of this tasty puddingMake sure you think twice before tucking into a second or third bowl if you\u0027re planning on driving later on\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience WriterStian Alexander17:55, 17 JUL 2018NewsIt\u0027s extremely important (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt can be hard to say no to a bowl of your favourite pudding, especially if you\u0027ve got a bit of a sweet tooth. And sometimes it can be just as hard to say no to seconds if that first bowl didn\u0027t quite hit the spot. But a new study shows we actually need to be very careful with certain desserts if we\u0027re planning to drive afterwards, especially if you live in Scotland.  A number of puddings which include alcohol actually contain enough booze to put you over the limit if you have more than one slice, reports the Daily Record .    The research shows two portions of the popular Italian dessert tiramisu - which normally contains two tablespoons of brandy, Tia Maria or Ameretto , sometimes all three - could put you over the limit.  Fans of the coffee-flavoured dessert, translated from Italian as \u0027pick me up\u0027 or \u0027lift me up\u0027, are being warned to stick to one portion or face being hauled over for drink driving. The limit in Scotland is now 22 micrograms in 100ml of breath, compared to 35 micrograms in the rest of the UK. But that\u0027s not the only pudding you need to be careful with. Other desserts on the warning list include trifles, which normally contain about 100ml of cherry brandy (but you\u0027ll need to eat a whole eight-person trifle to get close to the limit) and Christmas pudding which contains an average of 150ml of brandy, sherry, whisky or rum.  But you\u0027ll need to have about five slices of the festive treat to put you in danger. Boozy chocolates filled with alcohol - like Bailey\u0027s mini delights or cherry liquors - can also put you over the limit. But you\u0027d need to scoff 850 to end up with a drink driving conviction, so we imagine you\u0027re probably okay... It\u0027s not just desserts which are a danger, with hot sauce, orange juice, peppercorn sauce and chicken marsala on the \u0027no go list\u0027.

Wildlife photographer Paul Goldstein snapped the amazing sight as he reveals that last year\u0027s fertile ice harvest has meant an abundance of cubs and healthy adults. It is great news as fears have been mounting that polar bears and other marine \u0026shyspecies could be wiped out within 40 years, according to new research. Climate change is warming the Arctic twice as fast as the rest of the world, meaning there is less ice on which the bears can roam, according to the World Wildlife Foundation .  Inevitably, this is pushing them closer to human settlements to find food, posing threats to the bears and the Arctic communities who live there. But Mr Goldstein revealed this week that he saw an amazing sixty sightings during his June expedition - bringing hope for the world\u0027s 20,000 to 25,000 wild polar bear population. The Wimbledon-based guide said: We even had more cubs than adults. This was remarkable and I have never known it so good.  His stunning photographs sees cubs following their mothers across frozen wastes and a stunning picture of three bears staring into the ice-free waters. Mr Goldstein said he spent a total of six months of his life aboard a Russian ice ship in the Arctic waters of Spitsbergen, guiding for Exodus Travels. Polar bears range across the Arctic Ocean, in parts of Canada, Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Norway (Svalbard). They can walk or swim long distances to find food or to breed – sometimes roaming across vast areas up to 600,000 sq km.  He explains: Climate change is having an indelible effect on the ice all over the world. I have seen glaciers retreat more than a kilometre in just twelve years but for once it is refreshing to be able to write something encouraging about bears and ice however fickle it may be in the long run. Each year I guide in this beautiful land of ice and tundra with its 24 hour daylight. It first seduced me at the beginning of the century and has kept an icy grip on me since then, haunting me like only a few other wilderness areas in the world. When guiding the principal attraction is bears, on ice.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front. We kept the ball too long in the midfield.“And I think it is more important for that, although some people will be disappointed with the result, we look at some of the decisions we made in the game.“We had 1-0 and the game in hand. Then we make a mistake and let them back in.”Csaba, though, remains confident a team he is still building will come together over the next few weeks.“I have to say this team needs a little bit of patience and time. We are not finished with the recruitment.“We’ve got Adam Barton now and we need definitely one player more in the central defence and also a striker.”Barton signed up on a two-year deal from Partick Thistle, who agreed to cancel his contract and let him head for United as part of the cost-cutting process they’ve implemented in the wake of relegation from the Premiership.That left Csaba delighted to snatch a player from an outfit who could be among his big rivals in the league campaign.“I am very happy that Adam has made the decision to come to us because he is a player who can play in central midfield and also in the centre of the defence.”Meanwhile, United pair James Keatings and Paul McMullan have been linked with moves away.Former club Hamilton are reported to be keen on Keatings, while Partick Thistle are said to want former Celtic wide man McMullan at Firhill.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first part of exhibition opens at art studio opposite dundee va","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first show in a two-part exhibition has opened at an art studio located opposite the V\u0026ampA.Dock Street Studio has launched the first part of Save the Graduate, a collection of fine art created by a hand-picked group of students whose work was displayed at this year’s Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design Degree Show.Accolades won by exhibiting artists include RSA Contemporaries selections, The Art Angel Award winner, runner-up in the Edinburgh Sculpture Award and the winner of the coveted Dundee Contemporary Arts (DCA) Prize.The self-styled “fashionable alternative to the white-cube gallery” works with the manifesto of “keeping it Dundee”The exhibition aims to be a platform for helping “the poor art graduate” on their way.A spokeswoman for Dock Street Studio said: “For many pieces, it is the first time they will have graced walls outside the art college.“Paintings, sculpture and concepts will all be exhibited and available to purchase.“Remarkable ability, paired with sophisticated execution in an alternate setting, makes for an exhibition that will lead to further Dock Street Studio hype.

When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace. He’s going to be great and he’s physically able to deal with the game here. Karl came on and showed glimpses as well.

which host a number of city centre pubs and clubs can today be revealed as Dundee’s most violent.Police were called out to South Ward Road to deal with assaults more than any other street in the city between 2015 and 2017.A total of 162 incidents were recorded on the street, which is close to a number of nightspots, including 21 serious assaults.On Seagate, there were 142 assaults reported to officers and 93 on Nethergate.Police were also called out to attacks on Hilltown 58 times and Strathmartine Road 53 times.The statistics were revealed after we asked Police Scotland for a list of streets where assaults were most commonly reported over the last three years.South Ward Road, Seagate and Nethergate – all in the city centre – and South Road in Charleston appeared on the list every year.David Glass, president of Dundee Licensed Trade Association, said he believed better policing is helping to keep trouble at bay in venues.There have also been efforts in recent years to make venues safer with information about troublemakers shared through the Duncan pubwatch initiative.Last year, pubs rolled out a “yellow card” system that gives those who cause problems a warning, while “red cards” can see them banned for a year.Mr Glass said: “The yellow card system got people talking about the fact that you can’t go about causing bother.“Every now and then we see police on the beat and we’ve always said that we would be more than happy to see more police out on foot.“Even just them popping in to see how things are helps in the long run.“I realise resources are tight and they can’t have officers out all the time but I think it does seem to be getting managed better.” In the last three years, the number of assaults reported has fallen by 18%.Chief Inspector Nicola Russell of Tayside Division said: “We regularly review analytical data to ensure our resources are deployed in the right place and at the right time.“We have a comprehensive policing plan in place and additional patrols are carried out during times when it is typically busier, including weekends and holidays.“We work closely with our partners and the licensed trade to identify issues at an early stage and to allow us to respond to them appropriately.“Sadly all too often alcohol plays a part in offending behaviour and we know that consuming too much alcohol can lead to people becoming more vulnerable either as a victim or perpetrator of crime.“My message is clear and that is to know your limits and stick to them.”A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council said: “Wherever possible we lend support to Police Scotland on a number of issues.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

principle for a £200 million development of the mall in Aberdeen.Under the plans – which were first tabled in February 2016 – there would be space for 30 new retailers and a 120-bedroom hotel.Bosses had also proposed providing an extra 1,000-space car park, understood to be a multi-storey.However, in their report, planners have limited this to an additional 294 parking spaces, above the existing 1,119, in a bid to prevent problems on the surrounding road network.In approving the application, planners said the application would “promote vitality and viability” in the city centre.Ryan Manson, general manager of Union Square, said: “We are pleased with the council’s decision to approve the application, one which aligns with the aspirations of the Aberdeen City Centre Masterplan (CCMP).“The approval provides a statement of confidence in Aberdeen’s long-term future as a leading retail destination and the potential to continue to offer new and exciting retailers and restaurants alongside expanding our leisure provision within the city.“We look forward to continuing to work with our customers, Aberdeen City Council, and all of our stakeholders.”The extension would be built into the current surface car park and stretch along Market Street.The shopping centre’s floorspace would increase 280m2 to 27,870m2 under the proposals.Hammerson, owners of the site, said in a planning statement from two years ago that the development would see the demolition of part of the existing retail park, to be replaced by an extension to the existing centre.This would house shops, and restaurants, along with providing a number of “leisure uses”.Bosses have said the design is yet to be finalised.Further detailed planning applications are expected to come forward revealing details of the scheme.A public consultation carried out in 2015 on the plans revealed a design around a maritime theme was the preferred option.The centre has been told by planners to carry out improvements to

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”. And colleague, Hugh Hunter, added: “There are exciting times coming up for Maybole and the town has some real opportunities to flourish.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit. It follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies. The game was then followed by a raffle. The three clubs had to choose a charity to donate funds to, with Royal Troon deciding to donate to Ward 3E. Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.

The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.

Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.

Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

The launch of M\u0026ampS Energy comes just a week after the high street firm split with SSE, its previous partner of nine years.  Customers who had M\u0026ampS Energy through SSE will be offered the choice to stick with the energy giant or move over to a new Octopus tariff.  M\u0026ampS said the new offering will \u0026ldquochallenge the Big 6 \u0026ndash which consist of British Gas, SSE, EDF, Npower, E.On and ScottishPower \u0026ndash and disrupt the traditional energy market, starting with a rebuttal of \u0026ldquopunitive tease-and-squeeze pricing policies.  \u0026ldquoTease and squeeze relates to the practice of new customers receiving cheaper rates, subsidised by longer term consumers.  Instead, M\u0026ampS and Octopus said they will launch a transparent price model and a digitally focused service.  Octopus Energy, launched in 2016, has more than 200,000 customers and is backed by private equity firm Octopus Capital.  Jonathan Hazeldine, head of M\u0026ampS Energy, said: \u0026ldquoAs we continue to transform M\u0026ampS, we have chosen Octopus as a new strategic partner for M\u0026ampS Energy.  \u0026ldquoOctopus\u0026rsquo values of responsible and transparent pricing and digital-first customer service mirror our ambitions for the business.  \u0026ldquoTogether, we can challenge the traditional energy market and bring green energy to millions of households at a competitive and fair price.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

Such was the anger of some pro-EU Conservatives at Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocave-in to the Brexiteers that one, Guto Bebb, the Defence Minister, resigned so that he could oppose the Government. He becomes the 10th person\u0026nbspto resign over Brexit.  In other votes, Labour\u0027s new clause 11, which aimed to establish securing a customs union with the EU as a negotiating objective, was defeated by 316 votes to 289, a majority of 27, and the SNP\u0027s new clause 16, requiring the Scottish Parliament\u0027s consent to implement several powers in the Bill, was defeated by 316 votes to 36, a majority of 280.  Eurosceptic Conservatives had earlier proposed four changes to the UK Government\u0027s Customs Bill aimed at imposing strict conditions on Mrs May after she produced a plan at Chequers that would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels\u0027 rules on goods and food.  Just hours before MPs were due to vote on the amendments to the Taxation[Cross Border Trade] Bill, proposed by the European Research Group[ERG] led by ardent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, No 10 announced it would not be opposing them, claiming they were \u0026ldquoconsistent with the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint.  Three of the changes - to maintain the Union and not allow a customs border down the Irish Sea, to take the UK out of the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime and to guarantee there would be no new customs union with the EU without primary legislation at Westminster \u0026ndash seemed to roughly align with the Chequers compromise.  But the fourth - a refusal to collect tariffs on behalf of another country without reciprocity across the continent so that the EU would collect duties on behalf of the UK \u0026ndash did not not least because the EU27 would not agree to giving Britain preferential treatment.  However, No 10 pointed out a section of the White Paper to justify its argument of consistency.  It reads: \u0026ldquoThe UK proposes a tariff revenue formula, taking account of goods destined for the UK entering via the EU and goods destined for the EU entering via the UK.  This, a Downing Street spokesman, made clear the idea of reciprocity was hard-wired into the Chequers Plan.  Yet the paragraph goes on to say: \u0026ldquoHowever, the UK is not proposing that the EU applies the UK\u0026rsquos tariffs and trade policy at its border for goods intended for the UK.  During Commons exchanges, Mrs May - in response to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock\u0026rsquos claim that she had \u0026ldquocapitulated to the Tory hard Right - was adamant the Brexiteer amendments did not change her Brexit blueprint.  \"He is absolutely wrong\u0026hellipI would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these Bills. They do not change that Chequers agreement, she declared.  But not everyone was convinced. Her Tory colleague Anna Soubry, a leading Remainer, told MPs it seemed Mr Rees-Mogg was now \u0026ldquorunning Britain.  In contrast, Priti Patel, the former International Development Secretary and a prominent Leaver, who tabled the amendment calling for reciprocal action on collecting tariffs, said the PM\u0026rsquos move was \"constructive\".  Her Brexiteer colleague Peter Bone denounced the Chequers Plan as an \u0026ldquoabsolute shambles and called on his party leader to take it off the table.  Kirsty Blackman for the SNP accused the PM of being \u0026ldquoheld hostage by the Tory Brexiteers and suggested the Conservative Government was riding roughshod over Holyrood\u0026rsquos voice on EU withdrawal.  The Aberdeen MP said while businesses were desperate for clarity over endless Tory confusion, \u0026ldquowe get only in-fighting and a prime minister, who caves in to her extreme hard Brexit wing.  Outside the chamber, one Brexiteer source boasted how Mrs May\u0027s move on the Customs Bill had confirmed \"Chequers is dead on arrival\".  Earlier, the PM faced a call from leading Remainer Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, to facilitate a second EU referendum given the parliamentary \u0026ldquodeadlock but No 10 made clear the Government would not agree to such a move \u0026ldquounder any circumstances.  The powerplay over the Customs Bill is just one of several potential flashpoints this week.  After the votes on the Customs Bill, MPs will on Tuesday debate the Trade Bill and the issue of whether Britain should remain in the European single market.  On Wednesday, following the last PMQs of the parliamentary session, MPs will debate Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU and Mrs May will later appear before the Commons Liaison Committee made up of Committee Chairmen.  It is thought David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, and Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, will sometime this week make personal resignation statements in the Commons, which will pile more pressure on the PM.  The danger to Mrs May has been underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers have set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by Steve Baker, who last week quit his job as Brexit Minister over the Chequers plan.  It has been suggested more than 100 MPs have joined the group, a number which is more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in Mrs May to trigger a leadership contest.  Meanwhile earlier in the day,\u0026nbspScott Mann, the Cornwall MP, became the ninth person to quit their post in protest at the Chequers Plan. The ex-ministerial aide to the Treasury and a former postman, said he would not \"deliver a watered-down Brexit\"."},{"url":null,"title":"from-home-baker-to-the-boss-of-a-biscuit-factory-how-morven-rose-to-the-top-of-the-confectionery-world","story":"  It was the start of a lifelong love of baking which has seen her rise to the very top of the confectionery world after being appointed as the manager of her own biscuit factory.  Morven Burden, 27, from Drumoig in Fife has been handed the keys to a massive plant in Romania that churns out millions of biscuits a year.  It is a far cry from her first homemade attempts as a child, but is the icing on the cake for the Scot who fared better in the kitchen of a five-star hotel in St Andrews where she was a pastry chef during her summer holidays from university.  Ms Burden is in charge of 250 employees and admits that despite graduating with a degree in economics, a career which involved baking was always her preferred option.  Now she produces three million biscuits a year, which is rather more than the desserts she produced for weddings at the luxurious Fairmont Hotel.  She said: \u0026ldquoI used to make what I call pretend biscuits and cakes, which basically saw me go through my mum\u0026rsquos cupboards and grab any ingredients before tossing them altogether and seeing what happened.  \u0026ldquoAlthough they weren\u0026rsquot edible it started something and I\u0026rsquove always wanted to work in baking ever since.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was at university, I wrote to all the hotels asking for a summer job in the kitchen. I would have quite happily just washed dishes, but the chef at the Fairmont said they wanted a pastry chef and that was the start.  \u0026ldquoI was once crowned the Brandy Snap biscuit queen and held a record of making 2,000 by hand in a single shift.  \u0026ldquoI loved it, especially weddings and other big events, and it was a natural step to make when I graduated to go into biscuit production.  After leaving university, Ms Burden started at a McVitie\u0026rsquos factory in Carlisle where popular brands such as custard creams and bourbons are produced in their millions, before she joined the massive plant in Harlseden in London where they produce the famous digestives. Like many others would do if they were in her position she admits that she \u0026ldquosamples her favourite biscuits off the production lines.  But after eating so many of one biscuit, she becomes sick of them and moves on to another brand.  She becomes sick of that one too and them moves along the lines doing the same before a craving for the first one starts again and the sequence begins again.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is very tempting and we do eat the biscuits until we get sick of them but we soon find our appetites again. Everyone\u0026rsquos the same and we\u0026rsquove all been guilty of eating a whole packet of biscuits in one go.  \u0026ldquoThe sheer scale of how we in the UK love biscuits became clear when I started in London and we were producing something like 100,000 digestives a second, mainly for the British market.  \u0026ldquoI often asked that surely we couldn\u0026rsquot eat that many biscuits, but apparently we can. Every country likes eating biscuits, but they just have different tastes.  Just before Christmas last year, she received a phone call from the head of pladis, the firm that owns McVities, asking her to take over a plant in the Romanian capital of Bucharest.  She is the youngest factory manager at the multi-national at the age of just 27.  But she does not regret the move and is enjoying life in Romania.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe people have been very friendly and have taken to my management style very well as it is very different to what they are used to.  \u0026ldquoMaybe it\u0026rsquos a throwback to the Communist era, but management in Romania is traditionally very regimented and the workers like the fact that I involve them in decision making.  \u0026ldquoIt is a smaller site than I\u0026rsquom used to but we still produce around three million biscuits a year and we have plans to grow the business four-fold.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very different to where I intended to be at this age as I thought that I would automatically go to the McVities factory in Glasgow seeing as I\u0026rsquom a Scot. But I\u0026rsquom glad I\u0026rsquom getting to travel.  To someone who oversees the production of millions of biscuits a year the last thing you would expect her to do when she gets home is eat a biscuit let alone have a favourite.  But she does and unsurprisingly perhaps, her favourite is not one of the better known ones in the market.  She said: \u0026ldquoI like all sorts, most of the kinds that everyone else likes, but I love chocolate gems which are small and filled with chocolate.  \u0026ldquoThey are my absolute favourite. They might not be that well known, but they should be. Mandy Major, the factory manager at pladis\u0026rsquo Aintree site in Liverpool, has acted as a mentor to Ms Burden through her career at the firm.  She said: \u0026ldquoSince joining us as a young graduate, Morven has shown true passion for the business and our sector. She has begun a remarkable career leading complex and varied manufacturing projects across pladis\u0026rsquo sites, and we\u0026rsquore immensely proud that she is taking on this new role in our global family, bringing all her expertise to Romania."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-face-fresh-commons-test-just-hours-after-customs-struggle","story":"  The Prime Minister was hit by a late night ministerial resignation following a\u0026nbsptorrid day of Tory divisions when she \u0026ldquocaved in\u0026nbspto Eurosceptic demands.  Further challenges lay ahead as pro-EU Tory amendments to the Trade Bill go before MPs on Tuesday.  Late on Monday, Mrs May saw off defeat by just three votes on two key changes to the customs bill after a Remainer backlash in the warring party.  Defence minister Guto Bebb voted against the Government, effectively quitting his frontbench role.  He is the tenth in a series of MPs, ranging from star names to minor players, to have quit since the Chequers\u0026rsquo agreement on Brexit, though the first Remainer to go.  Mrs May had earlier bowed to Brexiteer demands to stem a threatened uprising on the bill.  But the string of concessions infuriated Conservative Remainers who refused to back the amendments to the legislation.  Some 14 Tory rebels voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic clause that would prevent the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless it agreed to do the same.  An amendment that would stop the UK from joining the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime saw\u0026nbsp11 Conservative rebels.  Mrs May inched through with the support of three Labour MPs,\u0026nbspFrank Field, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, on both.  In bruising Commons exchanges, Remainer Anna Soubry accused Mrs May of \u0026ldquocaving in to Eurosceptics.  The Tory former minister told the Commons: \u0026ldquoNobody voted Leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them.  But as tempers flared, Ms Soubry was told she \u0026ldquoain\u0026rsquot no Margaret Thatcher by Sir Edward Leigh when she invoked the late premier\u0026rsquos support for free trade.  Amid the turmoil, the Government tabled a motion calling for the current parliamentary session to be cut short.  MPs will vote on whether to start their summer recess on Thursday instead of next Tuesday.

But an early holiday would stymie Tory MPs plotting against the increasingly politically fragile premier.  Mrs May told MPs the Brexiteer amendments she accepted did not change her Chequers blueprint for Brexit.  But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the PM of \u0026ldquocapitulating and said the Chequers deal was now \u0026ldquodead in the water.  Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: \u0026ldquoToday we have seen the truly calamitous state of the Tory party, as once again the Prime Minister is forced to concede ground to hold together her unholy alliance of MPs."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-sec-reveals-150m-expansion-plan","story":"  The Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow already holds the SEC Centre, the SEC Armadillo and The SSE Hydro \u0026ndash major purpose-built spaces for exhibitions, conferences and live entertainment.

Mr Duthie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll be looking to build an additional 5,000 sq metres of exhibition space, extending our exhibition halls, and effectively build a new conference centre but connected into the existing facilities.  \u0026ldquoOne thing that will do is allow us to stage two events simultaneously of scale.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment, if we have a conference in for the week, pretty much that\u0026rsquos it. We believe the market is big enough that if we had the equivalent facility we could stage two at once and thereby significantly increase the economic benefit.  He said he hopes to have reached \u0026ldquoa meaningful position with regard to securing funding by the end of the year.  \u0026ldquoWe are living in a world where competition in the conference industry worldwide is increasing significantly, Mr Duthie said.  \u0026ldquoStanding still is not an option. Scotland really needs to invest to move forward, but we\u0026rsquore well placed to do that with the facilities we have here, the location of it, the transport links, the increasing hotel provision, which is already being driven through the city, and the team we have here as well.  The plans emerged as Scottish Event Campus Limited revealed a 1% increase in turnover in 2017/18 to \u0026pound29.1million, with operating profit up by 19% to \u0026pound1.3million.  And the development of two nearby hotels is expected to begin this summer, with both due to open next year.  \u0026ldquoThis will increase the number of hotel bedrooms around the campus from 950 to almost 1,400 and will be an invaluable addition to support our growing conference and exhibition sectors as well as our live entertainment offering, Mr Duthie added.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThe SEC continues to be an economic driver for Glasgow and Scotland and the results are measured not only in financial terms but also by the economic impact of the campus which generated net additional expenditure of over \u0026pound1million per day in the Glasgow area, a total of \u0026pound400million for the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-to-vote-on-starting-summer-holiday-early","story":"  But the Prime Minister, whose Government has tabled a motion calling for the current parliamentary session to be cut short, has been accused of \u0026ldquorunning scared amid Brexit turmoil.

The number of shows about social media has risen from one last year to 12 this year, while productions looking at abuse have increased from 11 in 2017 to 19 this year.  However the number of shows about LGBT issues has fallen from 38 last year to 25 in 2018, and plays looking at refugee issues and human rights and prison have also fallen.

The research found that\u0026nbsp235 of the 966 shows (24.3%) at the Fringe in August relate to social issues.  David Graham, Founder of The SIT-UP Awards,\u0026nbspsaid: \u0026ldquoTheatre can play a crucial role in highlighting\u0026nbspthe many issues that society faces today.

It is a portrait of the German artist Max Ernst, who became Ms Carrington\u0027s lover in 1937, and with whom she moved to France the same year.  The painting, from 1939, has been bought for \u0026pound560,000: with \u0026pound100,000 of the total from the galleries, \u0026pound150,000 from the Art Fund and \u0026pound310,000 from the Henry and Sula Walton Fund.  The painting was an important part of the artist\u0027s life.  By December 1942, Carrington, from Lancashire, had become estranged from Ernst, and was about to move to Mexico, where she would spend much of the rest of her life.  She and Ernst met in New York, and as a parting gift she presented him with this portrait.  In exchange he gave her a painting titled Leonora in the Morning Light, which remained in her possession until her death in 2011.  \"We are deeply grateful to the Trustees of the Henry and Sula Walton Fund, and Art Fund, for helping us to make this stunning addition to our collection.  Carrington was born in Chorley, and was the daughter of a wealthy textiles industrialist.  She was twice expelled from school in England, and was sent to Florence and then Paris, where she developed an interest in art.  She returned to Britain in 1935, where her family expected her to marry, but she had other plans for her life.  While studying painting in London, Carrington met Ernst at a dinner party and they fell in love.  When Ernst returned to Paris, Carrington joined him.  Their friends in Paris included the artists Salvador Dal\u0026iacute, Pablo Picasso, Leonor Fini and Joan Mir\u0026oacute, and in 1938 Carrington\u0026rsquos paintings were shown in a major Surrealist exhibition at the Galerie des Beaux-Arts.  In the painting, Ernst is shown in a red robe made of fur or downy feathers, which ends in a fishtail.  In the painting, one of Ernst\u0026rsquos feet is clad in a striped yellow sock.  In his right hand he is holding a green lantern within which is a small horse.  A NGS statement says: \"Carrington refused to interpret or explain her work, her short stories, several of which were published in the late 1930s and 1940s, offer clues.  \"Horses were important in her writing and her paintings, acting as surrogate self-portraits it has been argued that her portrait of Ernst captures some of the ambivalence in their relationship, a sense of being emotionally captive and the need to escape Ernst\u0026rsquos shadow.\"  Following the exchange of paintings in New York, Portrait of Max Ernst subsequently passed into the collection of Pegeen Guggenheim, the daughter of renowned collector and gallerist Peggy Guggenheim.  She gave it to her husband, the British artist Ralph Rumney, and it has been in private collections since."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-thatchers-home-town-bids-for-statue","story":"  Officials in Lincolnshire are developing proposals which could secure a place for the bronze sculpture of the UK\u0026rsquos first female prime minister.  The Public Memorials Appeal has offered the 10.5-foot (3.2-metre) statue to Grantham after failing to secure permission for it to be erected in Parliament Square looking towards the Palace of Westminster.  Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos divisive legacy had prompted police fears of potential vandalism and civil disorder if it was placed in the capital near Parliament.  Westminster City Council advised in January this year that a \u0026ldquomore appropriate design and evidence of support from the Thatcher family may be considered more favourably, amid reports Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos daughter Carol was unhappy with its lack of a trademark handbag.  Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), which runs the Grantham Museum, and South Kesteven District Council (SKDC) are working with the Public Memorials Appeal to draft outline terms of an agreement.  Formal proposals are expected to be submitted to the council before the end of the year, allowing councillors to consider the application.  The statue, by Douglas Jennings, was funded by private cash and reported to cost \u0026pound300,000.  It is\u0026nbspplaced on a 10.5ft plinth \u0026ndash bringing its total height to 21ft (6.4m).  Mrs Thatcher, latterly Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, grew up in the Lincolnshire town and was the daughter of a grocer.  An SKDC spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe understand from reports that there has been some debate about whether the statue should have represented Lady Thatcher in her years as Prime Minister and even whether she should have had a handbag.  \u0026ldquoThere is no debate, however, about the likeness or the sheer quality of the statue.  \u0026ldquoWe have not heard this officially from the family. If the statue does come to Grantham, we would, of course, be inviting representatives from the family to join us at its unveiling.  A Public Memorials Appeal spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to offer the statue to Grantham on behalf of the people that have donated towards its creation, both here in Grantham and via the Public Memorials Appeal.  \u0026ldquoIt is a stunning statue and I think it would be absolutely fitting for it to come to Grantham. I very much hope we can make it happen.

Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.

The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) found Scots and Londoners were the most left-wing and liberal Britons with more in common with each other than with Wales and provincial England.  The new work overturns long-standing assumptions on both sides of the Border that Scotland has more cultural and political affinity with the north of England than the south.  Some 60 per cent of Scots identify as left-wing, compared with 58% of Londoners and just 51% of Northerners. But Londoners and Scots were also the most likely to back tax-and-spend policies and sympathise with people on welfare.  Neil Smith, research director at Natcen, said: \u0026ldquoWhile there are clear distinctions in the way Londoners think about certain social and political issues, in quite a few instances \u0026ndash despite the geographical distance and the different make-ups of our populations \u0026ndash Londoners share more in common with the Scots than with their regional neighbours. Both are more likely to be engaged in politics, have the greatest proportion of left-affiliated individuals, are more likely to fall on the pro-welfare end of the scale, and are most inclined to sympathise with benefit claimants.  The survey comes two years after Scotland and London emerged as the only two \u0026ldquoregions of the island of Britain to oppose Brexit.  London has become a stronghold for Labour in southern England. Its mayor, Sadiq Khan, shares the distinction with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being \u0026ndash reports suggest \u0026ndash- despised by America\u0026rsquos populist right president.  Similar social attitudes may also reflect the rarely acknowledged reality that Scotland, collectively, has higher living standards and economic activity than anywhere in the UK bar London and the south-east.  The analysis is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey carried out by NatCen, and considered one of the best snap shots of what people think.  It was commissioned by Trust for London, a charity and think- tank. The Trust\u0026rsquos chief executive, Bharat Mehta, stressed what he saw as common values across the UK.  He said: \u0026ldquoPart of the story is the striking similarities between the attitudes of Londoners and those of Scots.

The school launched its ‘Coding Club’, for children in primaries four to seven, which focuses on building the knowledge and skills of coding in order to deliver the next generation of digital creators.                                                     Expro’s funding will supply Lego WeDo 2.0 sets that allow the children to design, build and control their devices to complete a range of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) challenges.          The Apple Parrot drones are used by the older children to programme flight paths, manoeuvres and even aerobatic tricks for the drones to perform in order to complete set challenges - or just to impress.Andy Gould, IT Solutions Architect for Expro, said: “In an increasingly digital age, the knowledge and skills of coding are becoming more important for our next generation of school children.“We have seen the demand for apps and technology in the workplace increase exponentially, therefore future generations who can build/develop these will have a significant career advantage.“The equipment we’ve donated to the new coding club harnesses the enthusiasm shown by the pupils, allowing them to build their skills and confidence in this area. It’s been inspiring to see them embrace this technology so quickly, often outperforming the adults in the room.”                                                                                                        Cara Hay, Depute Head Teacher at Strathburn Primary School, added: “We are extremely grateful to Expro for its generous donation towards the development of our Coding Club.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 1:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What’s more, on still summer evenings it’s really nice to hear the students’ voices echoing across the harbour before we set off to sail.As the Year of Young People progresses throughout 2018 Mr Garrett said that Serco Northlink will be continuing to celebrate this special year with additional partnerships with the local community and its youngest residents.”Leah Hamilton from Stromness Primary School was one of the pupils chosen for the recording, which she found very enjoyable.“It was great fun recording the announcement,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220It only took us a few attempts and we were pleased with the final message.“We know that safety is important when travelling anywhere so we hope that the new announcement will help NorthLink Ferries’ passengers listen to the briefing and follow the steps carefully.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 1:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 1:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 1:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

We had quite a lot of bad weather just after we started in January, and then we had to wait for the big spring tides so we could carry out a lot of the work.\"The jetty was in fairly poor shape as it had been there for more than 100 years and had spent the entire time being battered by the sea.\"We made the jetty wider and also lengthened it.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770095.1531850404!/image/image.jpg","title":"major north sea oil project to last into late 2030s","story":"        One of the North Sea\u0026#8217s most complex developments will continue to produce oil and gas for another 20 years, operators have said.                The Eastern Trough Area Project (ETAP) is made up of multiple fields sharing a central processing facility.            It opened 20 years ago and is now expected to operate into the mid to late 2030s under as a “poster child” of the Oil \u0026amp Gas Authority’s maximising economic recovery strategy.            At the time of exploration, the individual areas were not deemed to be commercially viable alone, so the ETAP alliance was formed to develop the fields as one joint development.The project intially involved seven fields, four operated by BP and three by Shell, all funnelled through the central processing facility. Two further BP-operated fields came online in 2002 while two of the Shell fields have since ceased production.Day-to-day production operations of the remaining seven ETAP fields are controlled by BP from the central processing facility, with more than 550 million barrels of oil equivalent produced over its two decades.BP North Sea regional president Ariel Flores said: “ETAP embodies the pioneering and innovative spirit the North Sea is renowned for around the world and shows what can be achieved when companies work together for the greater good of the region.“When the project was sanctioned in the mid-1990s, BP and our ETAP joint venture partners were applauded for our unique collaboration and high level of innovation. Here we are 20 years later, continuing to push boundaries in maximising recovery and extending field-life.            “ETAP remains a key asset in BP’s refreshed North Sea portfolio and our enduring North Sea presence.”Dr Andy Samuel, chief executive of the Oil and Gas Authority, added: “ETAP stands out as one of the great maximising economic recovery strategy (MER UK) stories - a ‘poster child’ for MER UK, even before the concept existed.“Most impressive has been the great leadership and collaboration from the owners, investing significantly over decades to unlock substantial value in innovative partnership with service companies.“The area still has an exciting future, with plenty to play for and the potential for further discoveries to be tied back.”            Mary Church, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “Instead of desperately trying to squeeze out the last drops of North Sea oil, climate change ‘poster child’ BP should be taking a long hard look at what the consequences of its pursuit of ever more fossil fuels means for the next 20 years.“Like its fellow oil majors, BP has known about the dangers of climate change for many years, but continued to pump oil and gas like there’s no tomorrow, putting profits before people and planet.“We’ve already passed 1C of warming, and the climate science is clear that we absolutely have to move away from fossil fuels if we want to avoid truly catastrophic warming. That means planning a transition away from oil and gas that is fair to the workers and communities currently dependent on jobs in that sector.“It means directing investment towards the low carbon economy and ensuring that good quality jobs are created here in Scotland as we move away from fossil fuels.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4742452.1531823265!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 40 of scots back snp s claim of westminster power grab","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and

obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 18 Jul 2018 1:44 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FLYING-CLUB-SKYE-2.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today. It is fitting therefore that his name will forever be associated with Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and with the development of Kilbeg village, a new sustainable Highland community which places Gaelic language and culture very much at its heart.”\nMs Forbes, extending her own congratulations to Mr McQuarrie, said: “This recognition of Duncan MacQuarrie is well deserved for his years of commitment to the Gaelic language and Sabhal Mòr Ostaig.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

We may, if we have the courage, actually have a unique opportunity to create a future beyond division and sectarianism and build a dispensation that serves the interests of all the people who share this island. \nThe former South Antrim MLA also said divisions over the past can be overcome. \n\"If acceptance of a shared history remains a formidable challenge for this this generation, the concept of a share future may be a more achievable outcome,\" he said. \nHe went on to propose that a unique monument to all those killed in the conflict be built at the site of the former Long Kesh prison. \n\"I would offer one suggestion that a memorial or healing wall be established at the listed prison buildings. A sculpture, perhaps modelled on the Washington Memorial Wall, on which could be inscribed the names of every person killed as a result of the 30 years war that ended in 1998. This specially commissioned artwork would enable every victim family to visit the site and to remember and respect and would immortalise the names of all those who had died, of whatever nationality, combatants and non-combatants, those who were killed in Ireland and those who were killed elsewhere.\" \n\nMr McLaughlin also called for a question on a future referendum on Irish unity to be included in the next census, due to be carried out in the north in 2021. \n\"Perhaps the most constructive contribution that a restored Executive, on in their absence, a Secretary of State could make would be to arrange for an appropriate question to be formulated for inclusion in the 2021 census that would permit citizens to declare their support for either of the two constitutional options described in the Good Friday Agreement. \n\"The inclusion of such a question would have no constitutional effect, however the objectivity of the process and collation of responses would be essential to a decision on a referendum on Irish unity and in itself an encouragement for developing rational and thoughtful debate.\" \nConcluding, the veteran republican said now is the time for political leadership. \n\"Clear and affirmative leadership is essential and it is long since time for the political parties in Ireland to initiate a national conversation and to engage and listen to each other as they set out goals, aspirations and entitlements for an agreed future,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27411  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe Occupied Territories Bill - proposed by Senator Frances Black - is expected to pass due to the support of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Independents and Labour. \nSinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile welcomed the legislation, he said: “Goods and services that are only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be available in Ireland.\n\n\"On a daily basis, Palestinian villages are demolished and residents displaced to make way for the construction of more settlements,” he said.\n\"The international community considers the construction of Israeli settlements as illegal under International law and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. \n\"An EU report in 2017 outlined that continued settlement building places a great strain on efforts to reach a lasting and just resolution in the region.\"\nSenator Ó Donnghaile described the existence of settlements as a war crime and said the Irish government must comply with diplomatic and economic sanctions against the state of Israel.\n“The Irish government cannot on the one hand condemn these illegal colonial settlements and on the other hand freely trade with them.\n“This is the time for action and to make history.

disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of

Incidentally, both of those claims were the highest in the 40-member chamber.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f.jpg","title":"65207  ","story":"    \nTHE Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs believes that the recent sustained spell of hot weather - rather than pollution - has led to the deaths of a number of fish in a section of the Dunore River near Antrim.\nLocal man, James Cousley - who has lived on the Drennans Road\u0026#160 for more than 70 years - was distressed when he discovered the fish in the river, which runs alongside his property.\n\u0026#8220That river has been polluted before, less than two years ago, he said.\nBut after two visits by officials, DAERA was able to confirm that pollution had not caused the fish to die on this occasion.\nA\u0026#160 spokesperson said: The recent warm weather has led to high water temperatures in conjunction with lower base river flows in many waterways and this can have an adverse impact on the fishery and river ecology. \n\u0026#8220It is not unusual for dissolved oxygen levels to drop to critically low levels, particularly at night, which can result in fish mortalities.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren - including young children - made their way down Station Road, watched by spectators, they were unaware of a more sinister set of eyes trained upon them.\nVideo footage, which has spread on social media, shows a man in a beret and camouflage jacket with his face obscured by a scarf and sunglasses, raising what looks like an assault rifle before training it on those marching.\nWatching from a house on the route, he is being filmed as he appears to cock the rifle.\nAs the camera pans back towards the parade going past the house, he points the weapon in its direction before a disturbing \u0027click\u0027 - believed to be the trigger being pulled - can be heard off-camera.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f1.jpg","title":"65301  ","story":"    \nMUCKAMORE Seconds have reached the Ulster Plate final against Ardmore Seconds or Donemana Seconds on August 19.\nAnd the club\u0027s First XI gained more valuable points when they travelled to Stormont on Saturday to play CSNI in their latest Premier League match and completed the double over their arch-rivals in a vitally important game. \nThe fixture marked the debut of new signing Adam McDaid, who has joined this week from North West Club, Eglinton. \nThis weekend Muckamore travel to Armagh seeking a win against the bottom team, which would almost certainly secure the Antrim club\u0027s position in the Premier League next season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.
