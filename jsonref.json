It is something that hasn’t really been addressed.”  Photograph: Matt KavanaghMaria O’Donovan from Turner’s Cross in Cork used to feel quite safe walking home from the city centre, even up to midnight, but an attack this week on a woman walking alone on Evergreen Street has changed things.“I feel furious about it. I’m an independent woman. The late-night thing doesn’t even come into it. Are we ever safe anymore? Is it okay that half of the people in the world are scared?” Lara Decastro, a third-level student living in the Friars Street area, close to Evergreen Street, where the woman in her 20s was attacked last weekend shortly after 11.30pm, came to Cork four years ago from Brazil. “When I arrived here, I felt safer than I do now,” says Decastro. “I’ve always lived in the Friars Street area. I never felt intimidated. Even walking home from the pub, alone or with my friends, I never felt threatened. “Now, we hear of women, mostly, getting assaulted or being followed. I have a group of friends and we are sharing our experiences. It’s common to hear someone say they had a guy follow them. Now, I pay more attention to where I am. Post-Covid “The region I live in was very safe. But now and then, you hear of something happening like the girl on Evergreen Street last week. Now, if I go out, I never come home by myself,” Decastro told The .Adam Twomey, a student at Munster Technological University, does not believe the assaults taking place can be linked to the post-Covid opening up of society.“I think it’s a long-standing issue,” he says. “Maybe people are only noticing it now because it’s being reported more. Assaults are an issue for women for a long time. It is something that hasn’t really been addressed. “People probably think they’ll be listened to when it happens but then nothing is done. There’s an outcry, but no action,” said Twomey, who does not always feel safe in his own city, “It depends on the time. I use taxis when I can.”Elaine O’Sullivan, from Douglas, agrees that Cork’s streets are not as safe as before: “Covid definitely changed things. It was less busy and there was more intimidating behaviour.“I’ve never been assaulted, but recent events have made us all conscious. I leave the city every day at six o’clock and I don’t socialise in town,” says O’Sullivan, who lays the blame for much of the problem on drug use in the city.Rapes and assaultsWilton-based primary school teacher Bernadette O’Driscoll says her 12-year-old sixth class pupils have talked about the Evergreen Street attack. “They’re aware of it, even at their age,” she said.However, the director of the Sexual Violence Centre Cork, Mary Crilly, cautions that rapes and assaults have not noticeably increased, and the majority of victims still suffer at the hand of people they know.Crilly lives in the city centre and goes for a walk every night: “There would be places I wouldn’t go, like towards the bus station. I’m not saying women shouldn’t go there, but stick to streets that are well-lit.” Meanwhile, councillor for Cork City South East Lorna Bogue says the number of reported assaults on Cork’s streets actually fell during the pandemic, citing figures given to Cork City Council’s joint policing committees.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics politics after the pandemic","story":"Opposition parties are still putting pressure on the Government over the so-called “champagne party” in the Department of Foreign Affairs on the night Ireland was elected to the UN Security Council two years ago, but will the incident have any lasting political impact?

Video: ReutersNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said ‘it’s time to move on’. Photograph: Dean PurcellNew Zealand Herald via APJacinda Ardern said New Zealand would gradually reopen its borders to citizens, workers and international travellers a week after a poll revealed that support for her as prime minister has dropped to the lowest level since she was elected in 2017.New Zealand adopted one of the strictest border policies in the world to stop the spread of Covid-19. The approach proved popular in the early days of the pandemic, but patience has worn thin after a planned border reopening in January was delayed because of the emergence of the highly infectious Omicron strain.A 1 News Kantar poll showed support for Ms Ardern as leader had declined to 35 per cent, though it remained well above Christopher Luxon, the leader of the opposition, at 17 per cent. The poll also revealed a sharp drop in confidence about the country’s economic outlook, with almost half of those surveyed now pessimistic.Phased reopeningNew Zealand will allow vaccinated citizens based in Australia to return from February 27th and has dropped quarantine restrictions in favour of self-isolation and rapid antigen testing. It will phase in arrivals for its citizens in other countries, skilled workers and students over the following weeks and months, with a full reopening to non-citizens in October.“It’s time to move on,” Ms Ardern said on Thursday, adding that the gradual approach would allow more New Zealanders to receive boosters to protect against Omicron. Positive cases are running at about 140 a day.Ian Taylor, chief executive of Animation Research, a Dunedin-based graphics company that works with media groups for sporting events, said some businesses had started to move operations offshore out of frustration with the sealed borders.He added that refusing to allow citizens to return to New Zealand was an even bigger problem, as some families with young children had been separated for two years.“As a country, we keep talking about leading the world in keeping our people safe,” said Mr Taylor. “But we also lead the word in having our citizens stranded overseas. That’s criminal.”Ms Ardern tightened restrictions within New Zealand last month and delayed her wedding after the first cases of Omicron were detected in the country.Kevin Ward, chief executive of the NZ Airports Association, called on the government to reconsider whether self-isolation was still appropriate, with a growing number of countries allowing quarantine-free travel.He said that demand from Australian tourists – excluding those visiting family – was estimated at only 7 per cent of 2019 levels this year.“Expecting self-isolation to still be required for travel to New Zealand later this year when the trans-Tasman market reopens makes no sense,” he said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boriss betrayal revolutionary brexit mandate now almost total","story":"This is the week a Government that began with such promise finally lost its soul. Its great policy relaunch is a tragic mush, proof that it no longer really believes in anything, not even its own self-preservation. Conservative supporters, keen to move on from Partygate, were desperate for a comprehensive package of conservative ideas to enrich the North, relaunch Brexit and pave the way for an electoral resurgence. It was not to be.Michael Gove’s levelling-up blueprint is a grotesque disappointment, a list of buzzwords and targets masquerading as strategy, its pseudo-intellectual veneer and cod history intended to camouflage the fact that it essentially advocates the very same nostrums that ultimately destroyed Labour.A proper conservative approach to levelling-up would focus on schooling, and the heart-breaking results of the white working class. It would investigate family policy and the values crisis. It would create dozens of libertarian pro-business areas, run by development corporations, with almost no taxes and regulation. It would target cheaper energy. It would liberate an extra one per cent of Britain’s landmass for house building. It would tackle the failed monolith that is the NHS. It would not see spending on public transport as a panacea. It would reject targets, subsidies and bureaucracies. It would break with socialism.Instead, Torsten Bell of the Left-wing Resolution Foundation, Britain’s most influential economics think-tank despite our nominally Tory administration, describes Johnsonian levelling up as a fusion between George Osborne and New Labour. “The agenda combines the devolution of the former Conservative Chancellor with the last Labour government’s biggeractivist central state reprioritising spend towards deprived areas”, as he puts it.A central problem is that too many Tories now have a vested interest in pretending that the form of devolution practiced in this country has been a success. This is the very reverse of the truth.Competition between local jurisdictions works, but only if set up correctly. Britain’s flawed model encourages bailouts from Westminster, grants power without fiscal responsibility and encourages municipal socialism. It doesn’t incentivise local leaders to improve competitiveness, or to think carefully enough about spending projects.Eurosceptics were always opposed to Labour’s flawed devolution: The North East Says No campaign, which defeated John Prescott’s devolution drive in 2004, was a dry run for the Brexit referendum, and included figures who went on to work for Vote Leave.The Tories also have not answered a fundamental contradiction: why do they want to make everywhere like London, given that our capital voted Corbyn and Remain? Left to its own devices, London would self-destruct, imposing punitive taxes and chasing away its value-creators. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is at it again, threatening to shut roads and tube services if he isn’t bailed out. We need more Canary Wharfs, created before devolution, and fewer City Halls.In the US, the Republicans don’t want to turn the whole of America into New York or San Francisco – they look instead at Texas or Florida. We need to replicate the brilliant bits of London, its ability to create jobs and wealth, without the socialism and cultural Left-wingery. If the Tories really believed in local accountability, they would break London up into several competing entities, not create yet more dysfunctional, statist, subsidy-hungry, rotten boroughs all over the country.If the establishment technocrats are getting everything they want, the Right has been left with almost nothing, including on Brexit. The scale of the betrayal is staggering. The Brexit white paper is one of the most shameful economic policy documents ever produced by a Conservative government. Margaret Thatcher’s Bruges Speech, Christopher Booker’s Mad Officials, Brian Hindley’s Better Off Out, the Open Europe deregulatory reports, Business for Britain’s Change or Go: all targeted over-regulation. Yet that powerful intellectual movement, built over decades, has virtually zero presence in the Remainers’ Brexit being delivered by Johnson.There have, of course, been major changes on immigration and foreign policy, and the vaccination success would not, in practice, have happened had we been part of the EU. That alone means that it was worth it, though the agricultural reforms are flawed. The decision to allow Hong Kongers to settle would also have been politically impossible had EU free movement still existed.But when it comes to the economy, the Government’s policy barely differs from Theresa May’s Brexit in name only. The authors of the 2016 Treasury attacks on Brexit have triumphed: they argued that there was very little in Britain’s tax, spend and regulatory structure that needed to be changed, and, staggeringly, Johnson’s government now agrees.All of which brings us to energy policy, another case study in extreme failure. A sensible government would urgently accelerate its nuclear plans by creating a powerful agency modelled on the vaccines taskforce. As a temporary solution, such an administration would also push to extract more oil and gas, including by fracking.Instead, a government that no longer believes in markets will now simply pretend that prices are much lower than they are. The Treasury will lend billions to energy companies to allow them to moderate price rises customers will then pay higher bills in the future to ensure the Treasury (hopefully) recoups its money.The furlough and bailouts that accompanied Covid – necessary evils given state-mandated lockdowns – have perverted our politics, undermining self-reliance and normalising handouts.That wail you hear is the cry of Toryland: among the true believers, the long-marchers, the Eurosceptics and the free-marketeers, there is sorrow, anger and despair.

It says, “a wandering Aramean was my father” and is at the centre of vexed and energetic Rabbinic argumentation. One obvious meaning, however, is that the Hebrew people were themselves a migrant people – as the Bible clearly indicates. Migration is, of course, part of the human story to be found in the history of the British Isles as well as the Middle East, and everywhere where there are communities of people who suffer conflict, or natural disaster.But the displacement of millions of people in recent times is unprecedented, and the sheer numbers of those risking their lives to cross the Channel even on cold mid-winter days tell a story of desperation that is experienced all over the world. Many people fear that as the world fragments into conflict and climate change places pressure on resources, migration may spiral out of control.Today a new Fund is being launched in the name of the great 20th-century wartime leader, Bishop George Bell, specifically to support persecuted Christian pastors who are refugees. George Bell famously helped Lutheran pastors who opposed Hitler and had to flee for their lives. He, together with other British humanitarians such as Sir Nicholas Winton, recognised a need and acted upon it. There are still times today when Government inaction means that private iniduals have to act in the wake of a crying need.In response to the refugee crisis, former prime minister Gordon Brown said: “We’ve got to act for moral reasons but also it’s in our own self-interest to do so.” This reminded me of Archbishop William Temple’s dictum that the art of government is the art of so ordering life that self-interest prompts what justice demands. Both are right – allowing the situation to get worse is irresponsible.Another point to note is the fear in stable societies that we might be unsettled by the consequences of allowing large numbers from other cultural traditions to settle among us. I recognise the worry which, to some degree, we all share. Clearly those who join us must recognise that they need to embrace the values, traditions and history of the host nation, just as the hosts will allow the customs of the migrants to have a place among us.We are enriched by the presence of those who have joined us in recent decades. I hope the UK will give a firm moral lead as nations respond to the crisis facing the world today.To take one example, Afghanistan is now recognised by the Open Doors charity’s “watch list” as the worst place in the world to be a Christian. In spite of the pleas of organisations working with persecuted Christians, who face the death penalty for apostasy under the country’s strict interpretation of shariah law, the Government has not taken any steps at all to allow Christians to claim asylum in the UK. We have been awaiting a long-promised announcement from ministers on how they plan to include persecuted religious minorities in resettlement schemes.Barnabas Fund Freedom of Information requests to the UK Home Office found that in the Syrian resettlement scheme, Christians were consistently underrepresented in spite of the fact that they clearly faced violence and persecution. A tiny percentage – just 0.2 per cent – of the Syrian refugees accepted by the UK in 2017 were Christian. Underlying such shameful statistics was the Home Office’s apparent admission in its own equality assessment that the effect of its policy was to “disproportionately advantage” Muslims.Several hundred Afghan Christians, including pastors and converts, are currently in hiding in neighbouring countries. They are waiting to see whether they have a place on the UK Government’s resettlement scheme.The George Bell Memorial Fund will help them flee danger, despotism and violence, and travel to safety – whether they land on British shores or elsewhere. Sometimes it takes brave humanitarians like George Bell to stand up against even our own Government and bring the persecuted to safety.George Carey is a former Archbishop of Canterbury.

The committee would prefer the monument to remain in situ with relevant contextual material.”Historic England argued in its submission that the plaque was of “high artistic and historical significance”, adding: “Rustat’s monument adds to the richness of the chapel’s interior. It is the most important monument in the chapel.”The court also heard that English Heritage fears there would be “notable harm” to the chapel if the plaque was removed.However, supporters of removing the memorial have told the court that its presence was offensive and upsetting to undergraduates and members of the college, leaving many unable to use the chapel, including Sonita Alleyne, the master of Jesus College and the first black master of any Oxbridge college.Andrew Sutton, a fellow of Jesus College who opposes the proposed removal, admitted that he was “disturbed” that Ms Alleyne felt unable to attend the chapel with it in place. However, he argued that “rational and thoughtful discussion” might help people accept its presence.Mr Gau repeated the opponents’ assertion that emails from students petitioning for the removal of the memorial had wrongly asserted that Rustat “amassed much of his wealth from the RAC”.Mr Sutton, an accountant who has studied Rustat’s business dealings, said it was “disproportionate” to remove the memorial as there was a “vanishingly small chance” that Rustat had made any money from his investment of more than £400 in slave companies before he made his bequest of £2,000 (roughly £450,000 in today’s money) to Jesus College.Opponents say that removing the memorial would be an oversimplification of history and deny students the chance to think for themselves.However, Paul Vonberg, an architectural adviser to the college, said keeping the monument in place, high above the chapel transept, gave it a “reverence” it did not deserve.Mr Vonberg said the benefit of removing the monument outweighed any artistic and historical drawbacks.He said: “The harm that would be caused by taking away some aspect of a Grade I listed building is sometimes outweighed by the benefits. Taking away the memorial would cause some harm to the chapel, but having thought about it carefully it’s my view the harm is small enough to be outweighed by the benefit.”The hearing continues on Friday.More from NewsBoris Johnson and Priti Patel ‘misled’ public over 14 per cent fall in crimeLondon Covid hospitalisations return to pre-omicron levelsCovid lab leak theories ‘have put world at risk of a new pandemic’Military police probe Swastika graffiti on wall at army barracksHow will energy price rise and council tax rebate affect me?

The policy unit I ran in the 1990s had somewhere between six and eight members coordinating policy across the whole of Whitehall. The political office had two special advisors. The press secretary managed the media. There was no chief of staff or director of communications, roles that many observers take for granted now but which were first created by Tony Blair. The prime minister’s principal private secretary knew everyone and was able to keep a watchful Civil Service eye on everything that went on in the building.Life may possibly have become more complicated and fast moving in the decades since, but making No 10 bigger has been the wrong response. The advantage of a small team is that everyone knows what their responsibilities are and what everyone else is doing.Reactions can be fast and well informed – all the relevant people can gather quickly and help the Prime Minister make rapid decisions. Multiply the numbers and bureaucracy sets in – more people need to be consulted and, with responsibilities split, iniduals can avoid stepping up to grasp issues and get results. This is as true in Government as it is in large corporations.Furthermore, a crucial and often overlooked part of the role for those working in No 10 is to act as missionaries or proxies for the prime minister across Whitehall, operating effectively to ensure that the Civil Service is aligned with and delivering on his priorities.To fulfil these functions effectively, those acting in the prime minister’s name have to have sufficient personal contact with the PM that they are able to understand intuitively the view he or she would be likely to take on any issue, and are able then to represent that authoritatively in their dealings with other ministers, officials and external contacts.With so many people in No 10, that becomes impossible, and must create the temptation for those on the periphery of the Prime Minister’s circle to overstate their knowledge and authority. The policy leadership and clarity of purpose that is needed from No 10 to keep all of Whitehall moving in lockstep is then in danger of becoming diffused by a proliferation of inidual agendas.Finally, the building up of staff within No 10 works against the spirit of collective Cabinet government. Boris Johnson does not need a galaxy of experts in his own office – he and his staff can call upon any minister or civil servant across Whitehall to provide information, analysis and advice at his request.Working with and through the Cabinet Office and government departments ensures that everyone is focused on the same issues and drawn in on the same debate. If instead there is too much duplication of expertise and analysis within the Prime Minister’s own office, other departments can find themselves being excluded and the much-needed coordination across Whitehall breaks down.So the answer to address the apparent chaos in Downing Street is not, as Sue Gray recommended on Monday, to bring in new structures to further institutionalise the growth of a large Prime Minister’s Office. Such a step will serve only to entrench the separation between the Prime Minister and his Cabinet and undermine collaboration across the Civil Service.Instead, it is time to radically slim down No 10 and recreate a small group of trusted civil servants and advisers who can help the Prime Minister to provide the leadership needed for all of Whitehall to work together on a common agenda.Lord Blackwell was head of the Prime Minister’s Policy Unit under Sir John Major.

And it\u0027s one that the herbivores are managing themselves. The more they graze, the more the grass grows and trees are prevented.” Prof Schreve said one reason for the large number of animals present could be that predators had been drawn to the cave by the carcasses of previous victims, before becoming trapped. The cave environment, which was protected from mudslides and erosion, would have shielded the remains, while the alkaline environment would have helped to prevent decay. It will take many months of research to precisely date and research the finds, but they could provide an insight into how climate change affected Britain’s megafauna.The climate at the time was especially volatile. If the remains from the site  a long period, they could help explain how mammals responded to those dramatic changes, said Prof Schreve.The natural hoard was found after heavy machinery inadvertently removed the top of the cave last summer, which on-site archaeologists quickly recognised as a significant find. Six weeks of painstaking excavation was then needed to remove the items.The cave itself will be preserved but is to be sealed off from public access, so as to preserve it.More from NewsBoris Johnson and Priti Patel ‘misled’ public over 14 per cent fall in crimeLondon Covid hospitalisations return to pre-omicron levelsCovid lab leak theories ‘have put world at risk of a new pandemic’Military police probe Swastika graffiti on wall at army barracksHow will energy price rise and council tax rebate affect me?

Michael Gove alluded to this example of self-publicising 14th-century paternalism in his announcement yesterday of the Government’s “levelling up” proposals. The idea is that by bringing together innovators in one place, the Medicis unwittingly instigated the Renaissance.Mr Gove believes that by applying a similar model in England, left-behind parts of the country can be brought up to up to the standards of living seen in more prosperous regions. Boris Johnson, will also hope that investment directed towards these areas will be similarly badged to leave no doubt in the so-called Red Wall constituencies as to its provenance. Levelling up is the Prime Minister’s Big Idea for the parliament, but showing voters the benefits before the next election scheduled for 2024 will be a difficult task.Attracting entrepreneurs, businesses, arts venues, good schools, effective transport and the rest to areas that have hitherto struggled is clearly to be commended. The issue is how to do it. Top-down dispensation of taxpayers’ largesse to regions that for decades have relied disproportionately on the public sector for jobs is not the answer, although yet more public money was Labour’s demand, as it always is.The plan comprises a dozen pledges enshrined in statute to be achieved by 2030, with targets to reach certain benchmarks for improving outcomes. The political architecture to bring this about will involve greater devolution and the appointment of regional mayors with the powers to drive the agenda. As a former mayor, Mr Johnson clearly sees merit in this approach provided the right person is in charge. A mayor can act as a barrier to investment and development by pursuing anti-business policies. In London, and soon in Manchester and Bradford, “green” motoring charges are more likely to drive commerce away, not encourage it.The analysis of the UK as top-heavy is correct: London and the South East have a greater dominance in this country than almost anywhere else. But this is a function of the decline of manufacturing and the rise of services, not of state interventionism. If there is to be a renaissance in the regions they need competitive tax policies, freeports, deregulation and less, not more, government.More from NewsBoris Johnson and Priti Patel ‘misled’ public over 14 per cent fall in crimeLondon Covid hospitalisations return to pre-omicron levelsCovid lab leak theories ‘have put world at risk of a new pandemic’Military police probe Swastika graffiti on wall at army barracksHow will energy price rise and council tax rebate affect me?

The CPS said he had no involvement in the decision. Meanwhile, he claimed it was wrong for the PM to insist the Tories are the party of low taxes at a time when heaposs squeezing working people to the pips. Things were so tense, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle had to warn MPs not to accuse the PM of lying, which is unparliamentary.In his replies to Sir Keir, Boris Johnson earned roars of support from his own MPs as he trumpeted employment, GDP and wage figures.But perhaps he got a little carried away in his wording. Here are seven things he said that are either outright , or don’t stack up in context.  There are ‘more people in work than before the pandemic began’ This claim had been branded incorrect by the Office for Statistics Regulation just a day earlier in a letter to No. Director Ed Humpherson said the PM was referring to people on payrolls, but this excludes many self-employed. Mr Humpherson told Downing Street: The number of people on employer payrolls does not include everyone in work. ONS publishes data on the number of people in employment. The data for January – March  estimate that .m people were in employment compared with .m people in employment for September – November . It is therefore incorrect to state that there were more people in work at the end of this period than the start.  Tories are ‘lting the Living Wage - which this party introduced’ Tory Chancellor George Osborne introduced the National Living Wage in , but this was a rebranded version of the National Minimum Wage for over-s. That means the National Living Wage is, legally speaking, the same thing as the National Minimum Wage - which Labour introduced in . Importantly, the NLW is lower than the ‘real’ Living Wage which has been promoted for years by campaigners as the amount that meets everyday needs. The real Living Wage is currently £. or £. in London - compared to £. for the government’s National Living Wage, which will rise to £. in April. ‘In spite of all the dficulties we’ve faced, we have now got the fastest growth in the G. Absolutely true’ Technically yes, the UK’s GDP is forecast to grow by .% in  - the highest of any G country. But that is not the full picture - it also fell by .% in  according to the IMF, the worst of any G country. That means it’s now bouncing back faster too. According to the House of Commons Library, UK GDP was still down by .% in July-September  compared to pre-pandemic levels. This was the second-worst of any G country, behind Canada, Italy, Germany, the Eurozone, France and the US. The Commons Library also warned these figures are not % comparable across countries due to dferences in how output in the education and health sectors is calculated. ‘We’re getting , people off welfare and into work through our Way to Work plan’Tory ministers have set a ‘Way to Work’ target to help , Universal Credit claimants into work by June.But despite the PM’s boast, it’s thought the plan is only to get , people into jobs - not off Universal Credit. Sources told the Mirror some of those people are likely to continue claiming, at least in the short term, as around two-fths of UC claimants already have a job. They remain eligible for benefits because their wages are too low. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote a letter in April  ‘suggesting we could secure PPE supplies from a theatrical costumier and we could get ventilators from a professional football agentapos Ms Reeves did write a letter, and the firms it mentioned did include one behind ‘historic re-enactment clothing’ that was offering to make - gowns a week. However, the context is that she passed on the details of  firms that were offering to supply PPE - without actually endorsing their work.Instead her letter told Michael Gove : “You and your officials and those at the Department for Health and Social Care will be best placed to validate what capability and capacity these firms have.“But as they have not received a reply after contacting the Government, I wanted to ensure that the Cabinet Office was aware of them.” Labour insist she was simply raising concerns about the number of firms at the time that were not getting a response.  Keir Starmer ‘would have kept us in lockdown’While he didn’t specy this time, Boris Johnson has repeatedly made this claim in relation to December  when Omicron surged.The Labour leader welcomed additional measures to curb Omicron rates before Christmas  - but he had never called for a lockdown. At one point Mr Starmer said: Weaposve got a government that are hinting at further restrictions but theyaposre more concerned and tied up with party management at the moment than it is with public health. The question on my lips and I think on the publicaposs lips is where is the prime minister One time Keir Starmer definitely did demand a lockdown was in autumn  - and Boris Johnson eventually caved and obeyed those calls a few weeks later. ‘We’ve opened Freeports across the country just in the last few days’Eight successful bidders for Freeports were announced at the March  Budget.Since then they have been working up their plans. Teesside opened in November and Thames in mid-December. But when we asked the government today, we were told the other six are yet to open. Neither the Mirror nor officials we asked could find evidence of new Freeports opening in the last month or so.

It’s about taking back political control from local councils through metro mayors imposed by Whitehall. Nobody has asked for this revolution in local government – indeed, when asked, people voted against it.But the Tories ploughed ahead, and they intend to accelerate the process.The price for giving back half the money they’ve taken away from councils since  is to demand directly elected regional bosses. They think they can win those elections with candidates like ambitious, loud-mouthed Ben Houchen, mayor of the traditionally Labour area, Teesside. mayors have limited powers over transport and suchlike, but as Manchester’s Andy Burnham found during the pandemic, they are largely illusory. Westminster still rules.The combined voices of West and South Yorkshire mayors failed utterly to save the Leeds-Manchester Northern Powerhouse Rail route, or the HS high-speed rail link to London.Michael Gove, the Grovelling-Up-To-Boris Secretary, talks airily of better local transport. But the Tories have halved the “bus back better” fund.They wasted more money on unusable PPE in six months than they propose to give poorer regions in the years to , when this dog’s breakfast of a blueprint for Britain is designed to mature. Levelling up is a classic Conservative trick, to wrest back and retain control over millions of voters in provincial England. Scotland and Wales chose their own form of devolution. They don’t need or want these newfangled regional gaffers. The trick won’t work there.mayors are fake devolution. They get saddled with responsibility for things like buses they haven’t the money to put right, but no real powers to make le better for the people they are supposed to represent. Don’t be fooled. Kidsapos jabs going missing The understandable fixation with jabs for Covid has unwelcome side effects. The number of children having vaccinations against measles has dropped off, leaving one in  new kids in school without protection. Health chiefs fear an outbreak of this highly infectious, potentially deadly diseasethey’re not inoculated. This grim news comes as the Government does a screeching U-turn on mandatory Covid jabs for all NHS staff, on pain of dismissal. On balance, this is the right thing to do. But I fear the decision will strengthen the nutcase anti-vaxxers campaigning for an end to all jabs.Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who called off the sacking threat , has a big job restoring public faith in vaccination.Is he up to it  I wonder.  Break this spell Salford University students are warned that scenes in Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations might upset them. Even more incredibly, at Chester University “trigger warnings” were issued about the risks of reading Harry Potter. Crazy. I spent much of my first year at university reading Russian novels such as Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. They would give the little dears a nervous breakdown.

It comes after the price of wholesale gas quadrupled over the last year, worsened by the threat of a Russian war in Ukraine. At the same time the Bank of England has raised interest rates to .% from .%, making mortgages more expensive.Chancellor Rishi Sunak today announced a three-pronged fightback with a £ Warm Home Discount, £ off bills and £ off council tax. He said: “Without government action this would be incredibly tough for millions of hard-working families. So the government is going to step in to directly help people manage those extra costs.”  But furious critics said it’s not enough. Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, declared: “We now have the Klarna Chancellor - get it now and pay later.” So what has been announced today and are you eligible  Here is the move explained.What is the rise in the energy price cap in April The average household’s energy bills will rise by £ a year from April , regulator Ofgem has confirmed. Those on default tarfs paying by direct debit will see an increase from £, to £, - or %. Prepayment customers, many on benefits, will be worse hit with an increase of £ from £, to £,. The move will affect  million households and follows a £-a-year rise only in October. It will affect default tarf customers who haven’t switched to a fixed deal and those who remain with their new supplier after their previous supplier exited the market. Those on fixed deals will continue to pay what they do now, but will see their rates soar by the time they move to a new fixed deal. What has Rishi Sunak announced today The Tory Chancellor announced a three-pronged approach to make up for about half of the energy bills hit coming in April. More or less all British households will get £ off their energy bills in October in a £.bn scheme, but then have to pay back this discount over five years. Around % of households in England on the lowest council tax bands will get a £ rebate in April, which won’t have to be paid back. And finally, a £-a-year Warm Home Discount will be extended to more people in England and Wales and raised by £ a year from October. It costs £bn of which £.bn will have to be repaid by bill-payers in future years.Who is eligible for the £ off energy bills and how do I get it All domestic electricity customers - around million households - will receive a £ upfront discount on their bills. Energy suppliers will be loaned the money to do this by the government, and apply the discount “from October”, said the Treasury. It appears you won’t have to do anything to claim the discount and it will be applied to your bills automatically. Itaposs possible it will be a sum put on your direct debit balance - itaposs not clear yet. About % of pre-payment customers - who top up at the shop - will get something “more manual”, such as barcodes or QR codes through the post. Customers will then have to pay back the £ discount at a rate of £ per year out of their bills, in the five years from  to . Repayments could start as early as April , with a date yet to be finalised. Rishi Sunak said the £ discount will apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland will have the funds to choose to do the same thing. The full details of how it’ll be paid - and paid back - have not yet been worked out and the Business Department will run a consultation. Who is eligible for the £ off council tax and how do I get it All households in England that are in council tax bands A, B, C or D will get a £ rebate off their council tax bills for one year. The government says this covers around % of all the households in the country. The rebate will be made directly by councils in April, when they issue bills for the next year, as a one-off credit on your direct debit account. Some households do not pay by direct debit. The Treasury claimed councils “will be ready to process their claims in April”. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it will not apply to second homes or empty homes. We are still waiting for more details. Unlike the £ discount on energy bills, the £ off council tax will not have to be paid back. This policy will only apply in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive funding to replicate the movethey wish to.You can check your council tax band here.Do I have to pay it back The £ discount off energy bills in October does have to be paid back, at a rate of £ per year for five years from . The £ rebate off council tax bills does not have to be paid back - but there is a sting in the tail. Council tax bills will still rise this year, at % for many authorities, and is likely to rise again in April . That meansthere’s no rebate next year, people will feel a big rise in their pockets all at once.What other help was announced today The Warm Home Discount Scheme will be raised by £ to £ in October, and eligibility will be extended to about , more households than now. That will expand the scheme to .million households in total on a permanent basis - but only from next winter. Currently you’re eligibleyou’re on a low income and meet a criteria from your supplier, or you get a Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. Under the expansion, more people will be assigned as being eligible for the discount by their supplier, which is done using a complicated formula. The Warm Home Discount Scheme applies to England and Wales. Meanwhile, there is help for some people who will slip through the cracks of the council tax discount announced today. The Treasury said there’ll be £m of discretionary funds for people who are vulnerable or on low incomes, that either do not pay Council Tax, or pay Council Tax for properties in Bands E-H. Does it go far enough  Furious critics, unions and Labour say it does not.It only funds half the rise in energy bills, £ of the £ has to be paid back, and it ignores all the other rises heading down the track in April. National Insurance is rising, inflation is sending prices in shops soaring, and student loan repayment thresholds and tax thresholds are being frozen. Then there will likely be another hike to the energy price cap in October, despite the fact the £ rebate is only coming in then. Labour MP Chris Bryant branded it “puny” saying: “£ isn’t going to touch the sides for my constituents in the Rhondda. “Gas and electricity up for the average family in my constituency by £. Fuel up by £. The average weekly shop up by £.“ Universal Credit cut by £,. National Insurance up by £. And frozen tax allowances by him will cost another £. That’s £, in a constituency where the average wage is £,. That is really going to cause hardship. £ doesn’t even touch it.” The IFS think tank today said a worker on £, will be about £ worse off in real terms in - than they were in -. This is because the £ support will be offset by a £ real-terms decline in after-tax earnings. Is using Council Tax fair  Critics say no, itaposs not. Some rich people live in Band C and D homes while poorer bigger families can live in Band E, partly because bandings are outdated and partly because some big families are in fuel poverty. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “That will mean many of the poorest households will not get extra support while some of the richest do. And it’s people living in the north and the Midlands who’ll lose out most. “The hypocrisy, the day after the government’s Levelling Up White Paper, is obvious.” The Resolution Foundation said one-in-eight of the poorest families in England won’t qualy for the £ discount because of the houses they live in. Labour said those who donapost qualy for council tax support face paying £ extra this year.What were the other suggestions Rishi Sunak rejected Labour had called for the % VAT rate to be cut on energy bills, but Rishi Sunak said this would “disproportionately benefit wealthier households”. “There would be no guarantee suppliers would pass on the discount to customers,” he said, “and this would become a permanent government subsidy on people’s bills.” Others, including the Resolution Foundation and Labour MP Stephen Timms, raised the idea of raising benefits to target the poorest instead of the chosen plan. Rishi Sunak also rejected calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms - angering Labour and Greenpeace just as Shell posted large profits. Rishi Sunak defended his decision not to only announce temporary help for families - much of which will have to be paid back out of future bills. He said: “It is not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy articially low. “For me to stand here and pretend we don’t have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest. “But what we can do is take the sting out of a signicant price shock for millions of families by making sure the increase in prices is smaller initially, and spread over a longer period.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TaxCouncil taxEnergy billsInterest ratesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The scan was due last November.The shadow cabinet rising star tomorrow warns of the danger of record cancer delays and accuses the Government of “dismantling the roof and removing the floorboards” of the NHS before the pandemic. The former head of the National Union of Students who has been an MP since  was diagnosed last year just days after Labour Leader Keir Starmer moved him into the shadow cabinet as shadow child poverty secretary. Writing in the Mirror, he says: “I was out knocking on doors with a team of Labour activists moments after receiving the phone call from my consultant, giving me the diagnosis. “I had my operation in May.

I’ve only just been given the appointment and by the time I have the scan it will be three months late. “I’m low risk, but I’m worried these delays are becoming the norm. Patients with suspected cancer are waiting longer and longer to get diagnosed.” The NHS has a record six million waiting list and around a million of these appointments are for tests and scans.  NHS data shows a record low of only two-thirds of cancer patients with an urgent referral from their GP receive care within two months. The NHS target is %. Half of women with suspected breast cancer are waiting more than the NHS’s two-week target to see a specialist. Overall .% of people saw a specialist within two weeks of an urgent referral from their GP for suspected cancer, the lowest figure on record. Macmillan Cancer Support estimates that there are currently , missing cancer patients, with an additional , starting treatment too late. Nick Turkentine, chief executive of Kidney Cancer UK said: “We are very sorry to hear of the delays Mr Streeting is encountering regarding his follow up scan.“Patients have been in his situation for many years with hospitals often failing to schedule both scan and consultant appointments effectively, including cancelling at short, or no, notice.“Our surveys found that over % of patients waited -weeks or longer for their scan results which is unacceptable. “The key to a successful outcome with kidney cancer is to have early diagnosis and a clear treatment pathway. “We wish Mr Streeting and all in his position the best with their journey.” aposI owe the NHS my leapos By Wes Streeting Going through treatment for kidney cancer showed me just how much strain our NHS is under.

I was meant to have a post-operation scan six months on to check the cancer hasn’t ed. I’ve only just been given the appointment and by the time I have the scan it will be three months late. I’m low risk, but I’m worried these delays are becoming the norm. Patients with suspected cancer are waiting longer and longer to get diagnosed, left for months with the insecurity of not knowing. Shockingly, just half of patients with suspected breast cancer are now being seen by a specialist within the two-week target. When I asked the Health Secretary about this, he denied breast cancer had been deprioritised but couldn’t explain why patients are waiting so much longer. The pandemic asked a huge amount of the NHS and staff have been through so much. But the truth is that there were record NHS waiting lists, , staff shortages, and , vacancies in social care before Covid, thanks to a decade of Tory mismanagement and underfunding. It’s not that the Conservatives didn’t fix the roof while the sun was shining, they dismantled the roof and removed the floorboards. Labour will secure the NHS with the staff and modern technology it needs to get cancer patients diagnosed and treated on time, just as the last Labour government did.

ONS figures show .million “economically inactive” people were recorded as long-term sick in the three months to November . That is the highest since spring  and up a quarter of a million on the same period two years earlier. Of those, .million say they do not want a job - up more than , in two years, and the highest figure ever recorded. People who are long-term sick now account for .% of all those who are “economically inactive”, the highest for two decades. While the cause of people’s illnesses is not broken down, the numbers appear to have risen sharply during the Covid pandemic after hovering at around million since .  Dr Kate Summers, an academic at the London School of Economics, suggested the rise was mainly driven by over-s. She said: One explanation could be that Covid means people with a health condition who would previously have stayed in the labour market are not doing so, because of the possibility of becoming ill. Or they might have lost their job due to the pandemic and have not yet been able to find a new one. Dr Rosa Morris, of the Commission on Social Security which campaigns for major overhauls to the benefits system, said two factors could include Long Covid and increased mental ill health. Commission Secretary Dr Michael Orton of the University of Warwick said it will take some time to know what caused the rise. Labour condemned the figures, saying a “progress update” of the government’s Plan For Jobs makes no mention of the words ‘economic inactivity’, ‘sickness’ or ‘ill health’.Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jon Ashworth said: Ministers need to get a grip of this growing crisis in the workforce. “They must fully explain what their plan is to fix the problems forcing more and more people out of the workforce - such as the ever ening waiting times for treatment which after years of running down the NHS now leaves many people out of work struggling with ill health.“So far Ministers have no solutions. A credible plan for jobs would help people who can work find employment while offering true security to those who need it. A DWP spokesperson said: “Our multi-billion pound Plan for Jobs is continuing to deliver, driving down unemployment and helping people to progress. We provide tailored support to those with long-term health conditions, to get them back into the workplace, and are committed to focusing on what people can do rather than what they cannot.“Initiatives such as Access to Work and the Intensive Personalised Employment Support programme are helping support those with long-term health conditions into work and our recently-announced ‘Way to Work’ campaign will focus on getting job-ready people claiming Universal Credit into secure employment, rapidly filling vacancies which are at a record high.“Meanwhile, for those who can’t work, we provide a strong welfare safety net.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDepartment for Work and PensionsLondon School of EconomicsJonathan Ashworth\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Chancellor accepts the partygate scandal has damaged the publicaposs trust in the Government but believes his approach to tackling the cost of living crisis will help restore it. The Met Police are currently investigating  Downing Street parties and as many as six which could have been attended by the Prime Minister himself.Mr Sunak also told the BBC he wasnapost aware of parties which took place at Number , despite living next door, because he doesnapost spend his time staring out this window. Explaining what happened on June  , the Chancellor said: I am in the Cabinet Room for a Covid meeting much like the other , , God knows how many other Covid meetings. “You’re asking me about something that happened almost two years ago. I went to that Cabinet Room, as I did many other times for Covid meetings. And it’s right, that we allow this police investigation.” He refused to rule out throwing his hat into a Tory leadership contestMr Johnson is outed but went on to describe the prospect as a hypothetical situation. Acknowledging some Tories wanted him to replace Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak said: Well, that’s very kind of them of them to suggest that, but what I think people want from me is to focus on my job. I know a few of my colleagues have said that and theyaposll have their reasons for doing that, but I donapost think thataposs the situation weaposre in. The Prime Minister has my full support. Yesterday Mr Sunak wasnapost by the PMaposs side at a tense and heated PMQaposs session.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, another favourite to become Tory leader, was also not by Mr Johnsonaposs side as she continues to self isolate because of Covid. His comments come after three more Tory MPs publicly said they had submitted letters calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM. Yesterday Sir Gary Streeter, Tobias Ellwood and Anthony Mangnall expressed their lack of confidence in Mr Johnsonaposs leadership. Recent polls show the vast majority of Brits want the Prime Minister to quit and support Tories sending letters of no confidence to the  Committee. Research from Ipsos conducted after Sue Gray published her aposupdateapos report found six in  Brits support Tory MPs triggering a vote of no confidence but only one in three think it will happen.

And like every victim, it has yet to realisethataposs the question, then itaposs time to go.  Yesterday, a report he resisted ordering was not published. Instead, there was an aposupdateapos on the alleged criminality of his office, his staff, and his personal residence, and the PM greeted it in the same way he has every Mirror front page, ITV broadcast, and BBC breaking news update since late November: a burst of surprise and contrition with a half-le of . seconds, decaying into toxic belligerence that will linger in the bone for a thousand years. Events for which there was not enough evidence to merit an investigation by the politan Police had, in the space of a month, uncovered  witnesses,  photographs, and  pieces of paper.Despite the insufficient evidence,  out of  parties, on  dates, have met the evidential threshold for an investigation, on the grounds that those involved knew they were against the rules, there was no reasonable justication for them, and not looking into it would end Cressida Dickaposs career quicker than sending the riot squad into a candlelit vigil.One of them is an alleged gathering in the Downing Street flat on November , , which Mrs Johnsonaposs personal spokeswoman has repeatedly insisted is total nonsense, but about which there seems to be enough evidence to merit weeks of attention by an entire squad of coppers.  While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. One of them is Leshie Chandrapala. Her dad drove a bus. He died of Covid, and Leshie was not allowed to be with him as he lay in a coma in ICU. She believes he died because he didnapost get PPE at work, but the government hasnapost even written a letter of condolence to her family. A fortnight after he died, and while she grieved, they threw the BYO booze Downing Street garden party. The PMaposs response to the report was to say sorry for the way itaposs been handled, not sorry for doing it. And he has a solution. I know what the issue is, he declared. I get it, and I will fix it! He says he is taking personal charge, and setting up the Office of the Prime Minister. So who was in charge of his office for the past three years  Where is the drunken boozehound who careered around Downing Street Friday night drinkathons, encouraging staffers to let off steam with a long chug on the vodka bottle  Who allowed the culture of recklessness and lawlessness, at the heart of a government that was criminalising the same sins in others  Which leader has led his party to a disgrace worse than Windrush or Grenfell or Orgreave Bring me his head! bellows Boris from the Despatch Box.

The fact he took personal control of the vaccines may have something to do with the fact that  million people donapost want them. How many times has he taken charge, only for things to spin out of control  How many times has he shaken up the civil service, only to be rattled himself  Read more The nation is now watching the Conservative Party the same way as the rest of the street watches a victim get out of the police car, andto their abuser. They drag with them a whole country into this deranged, gnarled, unhappy misgovernment, back to the man who wonapost promise to publish the full truth in the House of Commons, where he might be held in contempthe failed to, but will promise it in the bar, to the MPs he has lied to for years, and who have been brainwashed into thinking such a promise is a concession rather than a repetition.Meanwhile the PM only appears in public when the public can be kept away from him. Abba tribute bands are raising their prices for satin satire. Andyou want a three-word slogan to describe where we are, it is simply: another fine mess. The PM or his we may get a fixed penalty notice pictures may or may not emerge. He may be out on his ear, or he may convince enough MPs to give him one more go. Itaposs irrelevant, because the fallout of this radioactive scandal will last to the ballot box and beyond it reaches into homes and hearts, to the guts and spines of millions to whom the words aposToryapos and aposPartyapos are now as repugnant as the fact that people like Leshie had their pain doubled and then dismissed by a man whose charm has long since been spent. The Tories got drunk on power, picked a man who can be fooled by a cake, and then dithered about whether to let him keep hurting the rest of us.

The roots of bamboo can travel up to a whopping  metres and they can break through all sorts of surfaces, from bricks and drains to cavity walls and patios.  aposRunningapos ieties of bamboo like the one found at the Hampshire property are particularly prolic as they send lateral shoots out underneath the ground which can sometimes pop up on neighboursapos plots. Founder and MD of Environet UK, Nic Seal, told the Sun: Through no fault of their own, the homeowners have suffered signicant financial cost, stress and inconvenience, being required to vacate their home for several months. The truth is, most bamboos are invasiveplanted directly into the ground and left to their own devices. He added that the Hampshire case was the worst case of bamboo encroachment heaposd ever seen in this country. Experts advise itaposs best to choose a clumping iety of bamboo rather than a running iety to avoid spreading problems like these. Those buying bamboo should also plant it in a pot instead of in the ground and make sure to trim it frequently.

I could not do anything as I felt ashe was watching and following me. “At university he would stare at me from across the room and spent my entire third year living at home panicking he was outside my front door. aposaposI have constant nightmares about him which have not stopped that he is torturing me. My anxiety has never been so high and I cannot be the person I should be because of him. “He took away my choice to learn how to live and be independent and I find it hard to trust anyone as I have an innate fear it will happen to me again.aposapos Grainger began stalking Ms Smith between September and October  and was further ordered to pay Miss Smith £, compensation. Further inquiries revealed he had used social media to harass two other young women. In some messages, Grainger told Ms Smith: “Have you ever thought about killing yourself. Kill yourself – everyone wants that. Go jump off a bridge. I cannot wait to plunge this kne into your stomach and see you in pain. No one thinks you’re pretty.aposapos Sentencing Judge Timothy Smith told Grainger: aposaposYou subjected Ms Smith to a protracted, persistent stalking campaign by attending outside her home address and bombarding her with the most vile, abusive and threatening messages that were calculated and intended to cause her real harm, distress and upset. “It was a torrent of the most cruel, mean, abusive, abhorrent, vile, vindictive, and hate filled invective. aposaposEvery time she blocked an Instagram account, within minutes, there would be a new message. She would wake up and have several dferent accounts messaging her with multiple messages. She could scarcely breathe before there would be another. aposaposEventually Ms Smith removed herself from Instagram entirely to prevent more messaging however you simply moved to Facebook with profile pictures included those of Ms Smith edited to look like pornographic images – as well as one picture of a person who had blood pouring down her face.aposaposThey are some of the nastiest and most repellent messages I have seen. They were crafted and designed to abuse, undermine, demean, harm, hurt and generate fear - and they clearly did so.” The court was told how the pair met in March , at a nightclub in Manchester. They swapped numbers and social media accounts and became friends, but issues began to arise when Ms Smith went home for the summer and Grainger began messaging her saying he was lonely. Mr Ben Berkson, prosecuting, said: aposaposShe went on a holiday with other university mates and this angered Mr Grainger who felt affronted that her other friends were prioritised over him. Ms Smith stopped contact with him and deleted him off Instagram and Snapchat.

In total,  Instagram accounts had been used to send messages harassing Ms Smith who eventually deleted her own Instagram account to stop the abuse. aposaposBut her friends and family then began receiving friend requests from Instagram and Facebook profiles invented by the defendant but in Georgia Smith’s name. The defendant played on her insecurities.  aposaposThere is a certain vulnerability about a young girl who has fled the nest for the first time for university. She was left in the knowledge that edited pictures of her are now on the internet on porn sites, which is a particularly spiteful aspect of this offending. aposaposHer housemates had to pace the streets in order to try and identy the inidual who was terrorising their friend. On one occasion they apprehended Mr Grainger who was stalking their house – telling him to leave the area on multiple occasions.aposapos Grainger was arrested in October  after being spotted lurking outside Ms Smithaposs house by her boyfriend. Police found incriminating pictures of the property on his pen drives and mobile phone and discovered internet searches for images of aposaposbloody bodies.aposapos He later ly claimed an ex-girlfriend sent malicious messages to Ms Smith. The court heard he had a caution for harassment for  and was subject to a two year probation order at Belfast for harassing a third woman. In mitigation defence counsel Michael Goldwater: aposaposFrom living in a small farming community, he moved to Manchester for his education which was a culture shock coming from his background. “He had undiagnosed mental health issues at that stage and was drawn to the victim because she struggles from similar dficulties which he did. aposaposBecause of his mental health, he did not take rejection well and the ending of the relationship caused him to break down.” Riagain Grainger, , was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court after he admitted stalking involving fear of violence, serious alarm and distress, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said. Grainger was also subject to an indefinite stalking prevention order.After the case Det Con Thomas Small, of Greater Manchester Police said: aposaposStalking can have a devastating effect on a victim and their loved ones. Everyone has the right to live their le without fear and harassment, and Grainger made that impossible for this young woman.aposaposRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CrimeStalking\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There are currently , new daily symptomatic coronavirus cases in the UK on average, based on test data from up to three days ago, which is an increase of  per cent from , reported last week. Of those, those who were vaccinated with at least two doses made up , of the new daily symptomatic cases in the UK, up from , new daily cases last week.The study also shows that in England  in  have covid, with  in  in Wales and  in  in Scotland.  It also reveals that cases are now rising in all age groups, but the rise is much smaller in the + age groups, particularly in the older, more vulnerable + group, the increase is very small. According to the data, ZOE estimates that  per cent of people experiencing new “cold-like“ symptoms are likely to have symptomatic Covid.Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE COVID Study app, said: “While the bad news is we are again approaching , new cases a day, it’s encouraging that recorded hospitalisations, ICU cases and deaths are still coming down as Omicron is less severe in a vaccinated population.With a lag of several weeks between infections and hospitalisations, we’ll continue to monitor this rate closely in the coming weeks. We saw a similar rebound and second peak during the Delta wave as people relaxed more and children went back to school. It seems many are, again, preempting the end of the Covid- pandemic.It’s much too early for this.High case rates will likely be with us until late spring before the warmer weather and the summer holidays help reduce infections again.He addd: Over the past few weeks, the UK governmentaposs confirmed cases data has begun to move further away from ZOE’s findings. There are a number of reasons for this. The biggest factor is the change in testing behaviour that has happened this year. ZOE Contributors are now logging more positive LFTs in the app, and fewer PCRs. LFTs no longer have to be confirmed by a PCR so are often not being logged with the government, so confirmed case data is missing thousands of LFT results, leading to massive under-reporting. This subtle but important change in behaviour, highlights the importance of having multiple methods to track COVID in the population and shows the power of the citizen scientists that log with ZOE every day. The way ZOE collects and analyses the data means our data is always ahead of the other national surveys that are just beginning to show rises.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AppsEducationCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A -year-old man, who was found at the scene by officers, remains in custody after being arrested on suspicion of arson. The man was also taken to hospital for treatment on Tuesday. Gazing upon the destruction on Wednesday, parents whose children currently attend the school and former pupils spoke of how the fire has devastated a whole community. Ex-pupil Valerija Balinskaite, , said she broke down after hearing the news.  I was in tears, she said. It was awful. I live just a five minutesapos walk from the school. I saw a video of the fire and it just broke me. I have so many happy memories from the school. Grace Berry, whose seven-year-old daughter attends the school, said: It is just devastating for the community. It is devastating for the kids and teachers to wake up to these circumstances. But it is a strong community and I am sure it will pull together and pull through - these things tend to bring people together. Derek Barlow said the school is widely considered as iconic in the local area, and many of the people living nearby graced its hallways when they were younger. My we went there and I have had two children who have been to this school, he said. It was a bit gut-wrenching watching it last night. My we was sending me photos of it . She was very upset about it and the community is very upset about it, actually. The community is absolutely devastated about it - this school is iconic.  Headteacher Mr Mungo Sheppard said that emergency services had managed to save quite a bit of the building. I have no idea how quickly we can get back in, he continued. We have completely lost four classrooms for our year , ,  and  children. The direct fire damage has spread no further than that, so we have been able to save quite a lot of our school. It is devastating for these children. They are in tears because they canapost come to school today and they do not know what they are going to come back to. Mr Sheppard added that some children may have to be educated at other sites while repair work takes place at the school. Leader of Calderdale Council, Cllr Tim Swt, said: It was heartbreaking to hear the news yesterday evening about the fire at Ash Green Community Primary School.  My thoughts are with all the staff, parents and of course the pupils who usually attend this school. We know how much disruption our schools have faced throughout the Covid pandemic, so itaposs particularly upsetting that Ash Green and the local community is now facing a further period of upheaval. The school is working hard to make sure children are well supported and plans are being put in place to minimise disruption for pupils as much as possible. We are working closely with the school to support this and to assist with the recovery process going forward. Ten fire engines and one aerial ladder  were used to subdue the flames.A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Police said: Enquiries are continuing today into the fire at Ash Green Primary School in Mixenden.A -year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of arson is currently in custody.

This comes as a quarter of motorists said they were unsure of the rules around parking on pavements,Manchester Evening News reported .New laws around parking on pavements are one of many coming into power this year. And as well as facing fines, drivers caught breaking the new laws could be hit with points on their license too.  Some of these changes are still under consultation in England and Wales, but it is believed that local councils will have more power when it comes to fining reckless parkers. However, parking on pavements is already illegal in London and some other parts of the UK. Scotland’s rulings are expected to come into force in . Whilst some drivers may wrongly think parking on the pavement is fine, and barely an offence, the paths are there for the safety of pedestrians. If blocked, pedestrians might be forced to walk around in the road, which is jeopardises their safety.  Alex Kindred, car insurance expert at Confused, told the MEN: “What may seem a small inconvenience to some, might be a huge hindrance to others. “But it’s important to remember that pavements are there for the use and safety of pedestrians only, and therefore should be respected by all other road users. “However, without a clearer understanding of the law around pavement parking, it’ll be hard to implement fines to drivers who break the rules.

The issue can be particularly dangerous for children and those with disabilities. A number of changes were made in the Highway Code recently which aims to protect all road users from unnecessary danger.  One of the rules involved pavements and the potential danger cyclists and pedestrians face when travelling down them. Rule  of the Highway Code states: “When using an electric vehicle charge point, you should park close to the charge point and avoid creating a trip hazard for pedestrians from trailing cables. “Display a warning signyou can. After using the charge point, you shouldcharging cables and connectors neatly to minimise the danger to pedestrians and avoid creating an obstacle for other road users.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Highways England\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Six-month-old Roxy went from being a crazy little puppy running around everywhere to a dog with pain in her big brown eyes. Just two weeks ago, the puppyaposs back legs suddenly went wobbly and she couldnapost get up off the sofa. She now needs to raise £, before she can have a double hip replacement, as the surgery exceeds her pet insurance cover. Without surgery, Roxy will remain in extreme pain and discomfort, but with new hips, she can live a fulfilled and happy le like any other dog.  Owner Rebecca North, based in Guildford, Surrey, bought eight-week-old Roxy from a good breeder last September. Rebecca’s husband, Elvis, and their two children, Kayleigh, , and Kieran, , “absolutely fell in love” with Roxy, as did her new sibling, two-year-old golden retriever, Kaleb. Rebecca describes Roxy as “the most adorable, loving dog”. Roxy has a “mischievous” side and loves nothing more than playing with the children - and occasionally eating wallpaper. “She will happily lay on the floor with her toys around her,” Rebecca said. On January , Rebecca and Kayleigh took Roxy for her first off-lead run around the local common. “She was absolutely fine, running around like a crazy little puppy”, Rebecca said. “Then later that day, when I was at work, Kayleigh sent me a video of Roxy struggling to get up off the sofa. “It was like her back legs couldn’t work.” Rebecca rushed home and worryingly contacted her local vet, who prescribed pain killer injections. “At first, the vet thought it was a pulled muscle, but after several visits she was diagnosed with hip dysplasia,” Rebecca said. Now, Roxy is “really wobbly on her back legs” and struggles to play. “When she walks, you can see the pain in her little face,” Rebecca said. “Her big brown eyes look really sad at the moment. It breaks my heart.” Roxy has been referred to an orthopaedic specialist to have a “gold standard” double hip replacement, which would cost £, per hip. Her pet insurance only covers £, of the £, total - meaning the family need to find £, to give Roxy a second chance at le. “If she doesn’t have the surgery, it will lead to osteoarthritis and she will be in extreme pain and discomfort,” Rebecca explained. “It would limit her ability to be a puppy and play. “If she has the operation, she will live a fulfilled and happy le like any other dog.”  There is a possibility that young Roxy may be a candidate for a Triple Pelvic Osteotomy , which costs less money - but is still more than the pet insurance will cover. “Very few dogs are elected for TPO,” Rebecca said.Ten days ago, daughter Kayleigh decided to set up aGoFundMe pagefor family and friends to donate towards Roxyaposs surgery.So far, they have raised £ towards their goal. “If Roxy is elected for TPO, she will have surgery in the next two weeks,” Rebecca said. “If she needs to have a full hip replacement, she will have the operation as soon as we’ve raised enough funds.” If you’d like to help fix Roxy’s wobbly back legs, you can donate to herGoFundMe page.

The archaeological team conducted detailed scientic sampling to try and find out as much about the remains as possible. It was led by a team that includes Orion Heritage, Exeter-based AC Archaeology and a number of academic experts supported by the South West Science Advisor from Historic England.  Rob Bourn, Managing Director of Orion Heritage and lead archaeologist on the project for the Sherford Consortium, said: “This is a major discovery of national signicance – a once in a letime experience for those involved. Construction happening at Sherford is the sole reason these findings have been discovered and it is remarkable that they have laid undisturbed until now. To find such an array of artefacts untouched for so long is a rare and special occurrence. Equally rare is the presence of complete or semi-complete inidual animals.  We look forward to reaching the stage where the discoveries can be shared and displayed, so that everyone can find out more about our distant past.” The project has involved a close partnership with Devon County Council’s Historic Environment Team – as archaeological advisors to South Hams District Council – and the programme of investigations has been informed by specialist advice and expertise from the local archaeological and geological community. The animal bones and environmental samples have been carefully recorded and removed from the ground and are now undergoing academic analysis and conservation. It is expected that the full archive of remains willto Devon, into the care of The Box – Plymouth’s new museum – just a few miles from where they were uncovered.  Victoria Pomery, CEO at The Box, said: “What an amazing discovery this is. We already have some fascinating items in the collections at The Box from this era, some of which provided the inspiration for the hugely popular woolly mammoth and cave lion skeleton we have on display in our natural history gallery. Once all the analysis work is completed it will be a huge honour to care for and display these newly discovered finds, and to play an ongoing part in the public’s understanding of Plymouth and the animals that were here during the Ice Age.”  Duncan Wilson, Chief Executive of Historic England, said: “This discovery is exceptional. To have found partial remains of such a range of species here in Devon gives us a brilliant insight into the animals which roamed around Ice Age Britain thousands of years ago, as well as a better understanding of the environment and climate at the time. We are delighted that this important part of our history will be preserved for future generations.”  The Sherford Consortium will preserve the area where the remains have been found. The underground space will be conserved, and no construction will take place on top of it. However, the entrance will be closed to both protect the historic site and ensure public welfare. It is not, nor will be, possible for the public to safely access the area in which the discoveries have been made. Experts are not % sure as to how all the animals got there, but have a number of theories.  Whether all of the creatures uncovered at Sherford coexisted in a similar time period, or existed at dferent points over a much longer time span is uncertain. One theory is that some of the creatures fell into a pit and were unable to escape, and carnivorous scavengers followed and met a similar fate – or the animals died where and the bones washed into the area over a period of time. Rob Bourn adds, “The South West would have been very dferent back then it was an area where mammoths and other creatures thrived, roaming great distances across a landscape that looked very dferent to today. With glaciers not far away in South Wales, and a volatile climate prone to huge floods, what we have found at Sherford may well have died somewhere nearby and were washed up here to create this unique collection of historic remains.”  The signicance of the recovered remains lies in their likely age and potential to provide clues about le in Britain in the last Ice Age, and the array of bones from dferent animals has especially intrigued experts. The detailed samples taken from the site have so far uncovered: Partial remains of a woolly mammoth, including a tusk, molar tooth and other bones Partial remains of a woolly rhinoceros, including an incomplete skull and lower jaw A virtually complete wolf skeleton Partial remains of hyena, horse, reindeer, mountain hare and red fox  Bones of ious small mammals such as bats and shrews. It is anticipated that further bones of small mammals will be identied during post-excavation laboratory analysis. The archaeological excavation of the Ice Age animal remains has just been completed, but work continues offsite, where the bones are now being cleaned, conserved and studied in detail. A technically challenging site investigation, it has taken the dedicated team time to carefully explore and extract the findings, with sediment samples and an array of remains removed for research and preservation. Rob Bourn adds, “This investigation has been in exceptionally safe hands with the best professional archaeological team we could put together, uniting a group of specialist academics from across the UK with experts that have worked closely together over a long time. It has also involved a team working under the ground for weeks on end to recover the remains and take samples with the utmost care. We have worked with passion and professionalism to carry out thorough and diligent investigations.”  While all parties involved in these exciting discoveries recognise there will be public interest, people are asked not to visit the site. This area of Sherford is not suitable or safe to visit, and access is highly restricted in the interests of health and safety. Rob Bourn concludes, “A discovery like this would not have happened without the new town being created at Sherford the work to professionally recover, document and analyse the findings would not have been possible without the developers’ full cooperation and proactive approach to archaeology.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsArchaeology\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fearless pilots once used the base, which was built in , to help defend some of the biggest cities in England during the war.Some of the site continued to be used decades after the fighting but much of it has been left to decay for years, reports Yorkshire Live.During WWII, the airfield was home to ious aircraft from Hurricanes, Mosquitoes, Blenheims and Beaufighters to Typhoons and Mustangs. It also housed a fast but flimsy wooden aircraft called the de Havilland Mosquito which was only in service for a matter of months before being disused.  The base was tasked with defending some of the great industrial cities of northern England from German bombers at the beginning of the war. Some of Britainaposs very first night fighters flew out of the Yorkshire base with some paying the ultimate price to protect the nation. The site also hosted a signicant amount of squadrons including the firstRAF aposEagleapos Squadron of American volunteers, the first all-Canadian RAF Squadron, and the first all-Polish RAF Squadron.  Photographer Bearded Reality captured a series of pictures which show what is left of the base some eight decades later. The images offer an insight into what le would have been like for those who spent time there over the years. In a YouTube video, he shows some of the rooms that were covered in graffiti and taken over by nature including an old bar and kitchen area.  Debris hung from the ceilings while some of the flooring has collapsed. After the war ended, RAF Church Fenton was used as a frontline fighter station in the defence of northern England to the late s. Since then it has been falling apart and simply left to the elements. Initially, the station continued to be used after the war and its role changed to pilot training by .  But it was finally shut down for good in  by which time a number of its buildings had already fallen into disuse. The video shows Daniel and his companions running at dferent points after hearing other people in the building. At the end of the video, Daniel tells viewers: “That was RAF Fenton, AKA Leeds East Airport. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get into the tower because security rolled up right beside us. “The place is creepy but an amazing explore.”  After posting the video on YouTube, some viewers asked Daniel for more information about the site but he told them the buildings he visited were now gone.

The pair made a joint visit, along with Prince Charles, to East London, where they met textiles students at a centre run by the Princeaposs Foundation.The two women were seen happily chatting and sharing a joke as they toured the centred and looked at ease in each otheraposs company.And itaposs no surprise they seemingly get along as both of had similar experiences of living in the normal world before having to navigate royal le after marrying their husbands.  Of course, both are also the wives of future Kings and appear to provide a supportive shoulder for their spouses. Here we look at their close bond... Dating advice As the older and more experienced of the two women, Camillaaposs bond with Kate seems to have been forged through offering advice. Camilla had joined the royal fold several years before Kate so knew what le was like within the Firm. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.Kate had a lot to learn, and she needed to do it quickly as she took on the role of royal girlfriend while dating Prince William. And it was Camilla who reached out to offer her future step-daughter-in-law a few words of advice, and theyaposre very telling.According to royal expert and biography Robert Lacey, Charlesaposs we had a little tip for Kate - but she struggled to follow it. In his book, Battle of Brothers, Lacey writes: Camilla had confided to Kate the secret of hanging on to a busy prince: fit your timetable - well, basically your whole le - around his. However, despite Camillaaposs advice, Lacey claims that this wasnapost really possible for Kate as Williamaposs diary was un-fit-roundable. Pre-wedding lunch  Several years later, Kateaposs entry into the Royal Family was confirmed when she became engaged to William. The couple immediately started planning their wedding at Westminster Abbey - and it seems Camilla was on hand to help.According to the Daily Mail, she was spotted having a long lunch with Kate and her sister Pippa as well as Camillaaposs daughter Laura just weeks before the big day.A fellow diner, sitting just two tables away, told the paperaposs Richard Kay me: All four women were talking away like mad and none of the waiters could get a word in edgeways to serve their lunch. Kate looked fantastic in a very short black skirt, black opaque tights, a short jacket and boots. I heard Camilla saying... apos I can give you one bit of advice...apos Kate was really enjoying the moment. Personalised gtKateaposs special bond with Camilla was also proved when the Duchess of Cornwall gted her Kate a personalised gold bracelet. The bracelet is thought to have been given as a wedding gt to celebrate Kate and William marrying.The chain-link bracelet features one single charm with engravings on either side, as is reported by Hello! Magazine. Each side of the little disc features a monogram - both Kateaposs and Camillaaposs. On one side is the letter aposCapos for Catherine, Kateaposs given name, with a coronet and on the other is a aposCapos for Camilla and a crown. Kate has only been seen wearing the bracelet in public a handful of times - including once at Wimbledon in  and again during the Santa Barbara Polo Match as part of her official royal tour to Calornia. It makes up part of her fabulous jewellery collection, which features a number of other sentimental items. Joint engagements  In recent times, there have been several royal engagements that both Camilla and Kate have attended together.Last year, the pair, along with their husbands attended the premiere of the James Bond movie No Time To Die together.While last June, they also took part in a fun engagement in Cornwall with the Queen, where Camilla helped Her Majesty cut a cake using a ceremonial sword. No upstaging Another day that saw the two royal women together was Remembrance Sunday during the service at the Cenotaph.At the last minute, the Queen had to pull out of attending due to a sprained back and when they took the position on the Foreign Office balcony, Kate stood centre stage with Camilla and Sophie Wessex at her side.Despite the positioning making Kate seem the more senior, body language expert Judi James said it appeared that Camilla was comfortable standing to the side.She told the Express : With the Queen sadly missing from the royal balcony this year there was a very intriguing and possibly signicant re-shuffle of the royal wives, with Kate emerging looking very much like the highest-ranking woman in the group, not just by taking the central position between Camilla and Sophie but by her non-verbal signals as she stood in that spot.“With Camilla next in line to the role of Queen [consort] it might have been expected for her to take that middle position between the two younger women. Camilla appears satisfied with her role.However, thataposs not to say Kate isnapost aware of Camillaaposs hierarchy in the family, according to royal expert Ingrid Seward.She told the Mirror: Prince Charles is not even King yet and the Royals are very careful about not upstaging each other. Kate will be keen not to upstage Camilla. “She is aware of hierarchy and that it is Camilla’s turn.

For the outing, she wore a chic grey coat dress by Catherine Walker that she previously sported in  during an engagement with the Queen at Kingaposs College, London. She also carried a black Mulberry bag.Meanwhile, Camilla opted for a bottle green riding skirt and jacket with black boots and also carried a green Bvlgari handbag.During the visit the royal trio looked at ease as they posed by the Thames against the backdrop of the O Arena and the London skyline.  They then met students, who demonstrated their sewing machine skills and they even tried their hands at sewing a straight seam themselves. Kate and Camilla spoke to two home schooled sisters who joined a scheme with the Prince’s Foundation last year to learn fashion design, with a view to gaining work experience in the textiles industry.Soukayna and Safiya Ouhammou from Woodford, showed the Duchesses their designs for jumpers they are making as part of the course.

Soukayna, , said they started off by taking photographs on their phones of lily flowers on the river behind the centre, before sketching out their ideas that would lead to the design.She added: “We started by thinking about our inspiration from the things around us, so I took some pictures when we went for a walk by the river and the lily looked so beautul on the water.“It gave me the idea to make a contrast of colours on the jumper which could be stitched together, one on top of the other.”  Kate said: “It’s fascinating to see how the whole process works, it’s a great idea.” After being shown the sewing machines to stitch the materials together, Camilla said: “You’re obviously very good at this. I did it so long ago but I’m very bad at it now.” The royals also joined a le drawing class with the latest intake of students at the Foundation from September, although any potential blushes were spared as the model was fully clothed. Speaking to Imogen Lewis, , from Suffolk, Camilla joked: “I think I’d rather be doing the drawing with you!“It looks such fun. How long do you have to do it ” Kateaposs invitation to join the engagement is said to have been down to her shared interest and longstanding support of the arts and creative industries”. A royal aide said the visit was “especially signicant” as it was believed to be only the second time Kate has joined Charles and Camilla on an engagement together. In March , Kate joined the couple for an engagement at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London while Prince William was away in the Falklands on an RAF posting.The last time she joined Charles and Camilla for a rare joint engagement was back in September when the trio, along with Prince William, attended the premiere of the James Bond movie No Time To Die. And these rare joint engagements could become more and more common in the future, according to royal sources.At the time, they told the Mirror that outing of Charles, Camilla, William and Kate could herald a new era of collaboration and solidarity between the future king and his eldest son and their wives. Meanwhile, it has been a busy few days for Kate, who announced yesterday she has been given two new royal patronages.She is now the patron of the English Rugby Football League and Rugby Football Union - two roles previously held by Prince Harry. And to mark her new jobs, she paid a visit to Twickenham yesterday, when she tackled a rugby training session.

Each biscuitaposs taste, dunking power, chocolate to biscuit ratio and crunch factor was compared against the McVitieaposs brand to seeit really does deserve the title the nationaposs favourite. The supermarket brand digestives were put to the test against a £ double pack of McVitieaposs alongside a humble cup of tea. One supermarket came awfully close to the true McVitieaposs taste while carrying a much cheaper price tag.While the other two retailers were no match for the iconic biscuit brand, according to the review by Kent Live.First on the tasting menu was Tescoaposs milk chocolate digestives, described as crumbly and crunchy and priced at p.  The biscuitaposs taste was said to be strikingly similar to the classic we all know and love with a great chocolatey flavour. But the texture set it apart as it was much crumblier than McVitieaposs and likened to a shortbread biscuit. Next up was the more luxurious Marks and Spencer supermarket brand which was described as rather good but with a few set backs.  Despite being ranked as the closest to McVitieaposs distinctive taste and texture, the reviewer felt just a little underwhelmed with its higher p price tag. The chocolate was described as tasting a little cheaper than expected and not on brand with the MS name in their taste test. Meanwhile Aldi supermarket offered sweet-toothed shoppers the cheapest chocolate digestive priced at just p.  But the budget-friendly supermarket option is also noticeably smaller than the other brands, according to the review. Its taste was described as the weakest by far with a noticeably cheaper chocolate that was compared to that of advent calendars. The biscuit was said to be harder in texture and its smaller size meant it was gone within two bites. Overall the review still favoured the McVitieaposs brand as well as the Tesco own brand alternative.  The reviewer said they were left feeling rather disappointed at the end of the taste test with regards to the chocolate digestives on offer at Aldi and MS. McVitieaposs remained in first place for the reviewer who gave credit to Tesco for coming pretty close and making a delicious biscuit. If I’m ever in Tesco and in the mood to save a few pennies, this will make a more than acceptable substitute to my usual, they added.

Dr Gary Jenkins was violently assaulted in Bute Park, in Cardf, in July , causing him multiple severe brain injuries. He died  days later. Jason Edwards, , Lee Strickland, , and Dionne Timms-Williams, , admitted taking part in the assault on Dr Jenkins and pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery. They also pleaded guilty to assaulting another man who tried to protect the victim. All three were convicted of murder after an eight-day trial at Merthyr Crown Court in South Wales. The prosecution said the attack had been motivated by greed, homophobia and straight-up violence.  An audio recording was played to the court from a CCTV camera located inside a cafe near where the trio brutally attacked Dr Jenkins. Before the clip was played, members of the jury and others in the courtroom were warned about its disturbing content, which gave an account of how Dr Jenkins was cruelly beaten, robbed, tortured and left for dead. Beginning just before am, a man identied as Dr Jenkins can be heard repeatedly yelling Leave me alone and Get off me. A female voice - Timms-Williams - shouts Money and Now, before homophobic slurs are used by one of the male defendants, believed to be Edwards, who has a Liverpool accent. Dr Jenkins makes repeated pleas for his le, asking Why  and saying Please, stop it.  His moans of pain later become quieter before he is unable to speak any more. Timms-Williams can be heard saying Get down, Do it all over again, Do it and Hit him again. Another male voice at one point says: Stamp on his head. Stamp on his head too. Another says Keep going and Oh, let me stamp on him again. The attack lasts for  minutes, after which Timms-Williams can be heard saying: Yeah, I needed that. Witness Louis Williams can be heard throughout, attempting to intervene, before the three defendants turn and assault him. He told police that he attempted to lie on top of Dr Jenkins to shield him from the repeated kicks and punches.  Mr Williams said the three defendants laughed and shouted as they carried out the violence, and he thought Timms-Williams was evil and sadistic. He said: I couldnapost understand why they were hurting him so much.” Following the attack, Strickland could be seen on CCTV footage heading back to the Esso garage where he bought a bottle of whiskey using Dr Jenkinsapos Santander debit card. Timms-Williams and Edwards emerged from the North Road entrance and hugged and kissed each other for a number of minutes before they separated. In a prepared statement the teenager gave to police, she said she only joined in with the attack because she had been scared of the two men. Her defence team also claimed she was not homophobic and that she had been in a same-sex relationship. Following the verdict, Mr Enoch told the jury that a piece of evidence which had not been put before them was a statement from Stricklandaposs ex-girlfriend saying he had targeted gay men in the park regularly.  Judge Williams sent both Edwards and Strickland out of the dock for laughing and joking, behaviour which he said they had been displaying throughout the trial, before sending Timms-Williams down. He said the three will be sentenced on March  at Cardf or Newport crown court. The family of Dr Gary Jenkins,said in a prepared statement: “Gary was such a kind soul who would never hurt anyone. He was an incredibly generous and creative man who had only good intentions. Gary’s private le, being put on display through a Crown Court trial has only intensied the impact of this event on our family, friends and colleagues. It has been horrible to have to listen to the details of what happened. We cannot bring Gary back. There are no winners in this case, only losers but as a family we are relieved that justice is done.” Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Stuart Wales added: “Dr Gary Jenkins was a much-loved father, husband, brother and friend. “The attack upon Dr Jenkins by the three defendants was cowardly and senseless in the extreme. “The degree and duration of unnecessary violence inflicted upon him, together with homophobic abuse - all captured on audio, was both sickening and staggering “He did nothing whatsoever to warrant this.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Gary JenkinsCCTVMurder trialCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Daiva Paskeviciene, from Edinburgh,said that her daughter, a pupil at Tollcross Primary School, was not allowed on the bus because her pass did not work, and claimed it was a fault with the machine.The first alleged incident happened on January  when the schools had just gone back after Christmas break, reported EdinburghLive.Ms Paskeviciene said she received a call from her terried daughter after she was left alone waiting in the cold for  minutes for another bus home. The -year-old is claimed to have presented her junior ridacard, that had been topped up that morning, to the machine on the bus. The driver told her it wasnapost working so she could not get on and would have to leave the bus. Ms Paskeviciene told EdinburghLive: My daughter is in P at Tollcross and is -years-old, it happened after Christmas when schools went back. Usually she gets the bus, on that day at around .pm. She went to the bus with her bus card that I topped up that morning. The machine wasnapost working so the driver told her she couldnapost get on the bus. He then got angry and was shouting at her. She got really scared. The bus stop was at Lothian Road, she had to wait  minutes for the next one it got dark and very cold. She called me and eventually a stranger had to give her money to be able to get home. Next time I made sure she had spare change just in case.  I couldnapost believe a driver would act like that to a little girl then it happened again. She got a new bus card the free Young Scot one, it worked in the morning on the bus but again when she was trying to get on the  after school, she tapped her card and it didnapost work. The driver said, aposyour card doesnapost work, you arenapost coming onapos my daughter called me crying, and is now afraid to catch the bus to school.

Rebecca and her nine-year-old daughter often snuggle up in bed together early in the evening to try and escape the bitter cold of their home. Since the -year-oldaposs hospitality work dried up during lockdown, making ends meet on Universal Credit has been a real struggle. Despite being desperate to work full-time again, the benefits taper and child care costs that need to be paid upfront means sheaposs better off doing just a couple of days a week. Rebecca, who is among the .million people who recently had their benefits cut by £ a month, is now desperately trying to meet her rising food and energy bills. Power costs for homes are set to go up by almost £ from this April, regulator Ofgem confirmed today. The move will affect some  million households and follows a % rise in October.  To make sure her daughter doesnapost go without, the Australian national cuts her portions as much as possible. She also avoids eating hot food to keep energy costs low, meaning she survives mostly on fruit and bread, and rations her tea consumption to two cups a day. It used to be that Iaposd have the same quantities as my daughter, but now I eat less, Rebecca explained. I have to cut other things down to pay for food. When my daughter is at school I turn my thermostat down to C. Do you struggle to heat your home  Are you worried about the price rises in April  Comment below or email webnews@mirror I keep the curtains closed rather than letting the sunshine in. I have a giant poncho on and blanket over my legs. I donapost know what I will do in April. Rebecca is one of millions of Brits who faced a big energy bill hike of % in October, and are now looking at another % rise when the price cap is lted in April. The number of people living in fuel poverty - which means spending % or more of their income on energy bills - is expected to triple to % or  million homes in two months time. Having to cut back on heating and scrimp where to pay the bills can be tough. Being cold and hungry for most of the day leaves Rebecca with overwhelming anxiety and causes her to zone out while sheaposs playing with her daughter. The mum is convincedshe had a lump sum of money to pay for childcare so she could work, and for insulation to keep her energy bills down, sheaposd be able to lt herself out of her current miserable situation. We need a system that supports people so that their wellbeing and their tummies are okay, so they can be al humans in society, she said. My experience of poverty in the UK is that it is a terrible trap. I am here in poverty not from my own choosing. I canapost escape. I am not lazy. I really do work hard. I have been trying to come up with solutions, but there are just none. The governmentaposs job is to even society out, but that is not how it works now. People have forgotten that le shouldnapost be a struggle.  Another pair who are living in a frosty house without free-flowing hot water are Meg and William Miller, who describe their situation as like living in the Victoria era. They are two of an estimated six million Brits whose water and homes are heating by oil, rather than electricity or gas. Rather than paying a month energy bill, oil users have to pay up front to fill up a large tank. For Meg, , and William,  - who has Parkinsonaposs disease - filling a  litre tank requires the kind of cash they simply donapost have, especially now that oil prices have tripled since May  to p a litre. As a result the couple are forced to keep their lights off during the evenings and share bath water to keep costs down. When the temperatures in their home plummet, William and Meg sleep in the living room next to their wood burner. The sitting room is warm, but my bedroom is colder than outside the house, Meg, a recently retired transport and distribution manager, told The Mirror. It is not nice. The last tank of oil I bought was two years ago, but we canapost afford to use it for anything but for warm water to do the dishes. We were brought up in the cold, but you would expect in  to have running hot water. I hate not having that. We have worked all our lives and paid our dues. the least we can expect is a warm house with running water. It feels like it is back to the Victorian times. For other people, furniture poverty has combined with fuel poverty to create a particularly dficult situation this winter. Heather Humphries, from Poole, is a full time carer for her ex-partner and looks after her  and -year-old sons.While money has always been tight, until recently the thrty mum was managing to get by.Pre-paid food and electricity cards that she tops up in bulk at the beginning of each month are running out quicker and quicker, forcing Heather to skip meals so her sons can eat.The family wrap themselves up in cardigans and dressing gowns throughout the day so they can keep the thermostat as low as possible, and the boys are only allowed to switch their console on for a short period each day.As energy and food prices creep up, Heather has found it increasingly dficult to put aside any cash for items such as furniture and white goods.Over the past year a bed she bought second hand has fallen apart, leaving her to prop it up on a microwave to keep off the cold floor.The frame of one of her sonaposs bed has also started to crack. When it eventually breaks fully, Heather has no idea how sheaposll replace it.The microwave clinks and clunks beneath the bed, she said.If I move too far over the bed topples, so I end up being on the sofa. It is freezing.  Heather is particularly worried about how sheaposll keep putting food on the table and money in the metre come April.She said: I donapost know what I will do in April when the energy prices go up.It feels like theyaposve gone up a lot already I was putting in around £ a month last year, now itaposs £ to £ to keep warm.I really donapost know what Iaposm going to do. Iaposm hoping for warm weather.The -year-old is one of an estimated .million people in the UK unable to afford basic furniture or home appliances.End Furniture Poverty is one of several British charities helping people like Heather replace essential household items.Theyaposve had their work cut-out since , when the government abolished crisis loans and community care grants and replaced them with local welfare assistance schemes.While the new system aims to help people in times of crisis, they receive % less funding than the schemes it replaced. Claire Donovan, Campaigns Manager for End Furniture Poverty, said: “For millions of people living in Furniture Poverty, local welfare assistance is a vital leline, helping them to access essential furniture items like cookers, beds and fridges.“A decade of austerity, followed by the immense challenges during the pandemic, mean that millions more are now struggling, so we urge the Government to adequately fund and ring fence LWAS budgets, and provide clear guidance for local authorities to end this postcode lottery of support.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsFuel povertyOil prices\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That’s why, in this jubilee year, hundreds of organisations from the Scouts and Girlguiding to the Royal Voluntary Service and Confederation of British Industry are calling on the Government to create a new Bank Holiday from . This is a day for everyone for people to get together with friends and neighbours, to say thank you and celebrate the generosity that lies at the heart of communities. People can spend it how they like – helping others or taking a well-earned rest, together. The campaign comes ahead of the th anniversary of the Queen’s accession to the throne on February , . That’s  years of incredible service.  So the Thank Holiday would recognise her extraordinary dedication, and say thank you to the millions of others who do so much, with much less recognition. In Scouts alone, we have over , volunteers helping young people gain skills for le. This Thank Holiday can only happenwe all get behind it.  It’s a day to get to know each other better, to be thankful, celebrate our dferences and appreciate what we’ve got in common. Above all, it’s a chance to get together and reconnect. Now’s the time for us to champion those who step up in our communities.

The former It Girl posted an image on her Instagram page yesterday of Ms Giuffre in what appears to be the same pose and outfit as in the famous picture, but alone on a dferent background. The -year-old socialite, daughter of the th Marquess of Bristol, asked: “Do you believe that photo is real  “Or whatI told you a survivor of [Jeffrey] Epstein’s told me it’s an Irish body double that was edited in.” However, she did not provide any further information to back her claims. During his  Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew told the BBC’s Emily Maitlis he was “at a loss to explain” the famous version of the image. It shows Andrew and Virginia in the London home of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is smiling behind them. Ms Giuffre alleges paedophile Jeffrey Epstein took the picture. She claims she, the Prince, Maxwell and Epstein then went out for dinner and then to a nightclub. On their allegedto the house, she claims that Epstein and Maxwell made her have sex with Andrew. He vigorously denies all the claims.  Paragraph  of her lawsuit states: “The below photograph depicts Prince Andrew, plaintf, and Maxwell at Maxwell’s home prior to Prince Andrew sexually abusing plaintf.” The Duke’s refusal to admit the photograph is genuine is behind a line in his official response to Ms Giuffre’s complaint, filed last week. It reads: “Prince Andrew lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations contained in paragraph  of the complaint.”  Andrew said on Newsnight he could not prove the picture was edited but had reason to believe it was not genuine. He said: “Nobody can prove that photo has been doctored. I don’t believe that photograph has been taken in the way that has been suggested.” US lawyer Rachel Fiset said Prince Andrew’s legal response to the lawsuit indicates that he will “seek an expert’s opinion” on the photo’s authenticity.  Ms Giuffre, , is suing Andrew, , for unspecied damages, which US lawyers said could “easily” be more than £millionshe is successful. The mum of three, an American living in Australia, also alleges she was forced to have sex with the Prince at Epstein’s home in New York and in the US Virgin Islands. Andrew vehemently denies all the allegations against him.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellLady Victoria HerveyPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Claire Pulfrey, from Grimsby, currently puts £ a week on gas and £ on electricity with a prepayment plan. The former teaching assistant, , recently had her monthly income reduced by £ after her youngest son’s special needs were recently reassessed. With no extra cash left over to treat her three sons, aged seven, nine, and , Claire already scrimps and saves to get through the month. She can no longer afford to take them to the cinema or days out. Now, If she keeps using the same amount of energy, she faces an increase of £. a week. Today, Chancellor Rishi Sunak addressed the nation after the energy regulator Ofgem confirmed the increased price cap will see the average UK household bill increase by nearly £. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday he promised that Brits would receive an £ council tax rebate and a £ discount on their energy bill to manage the rising costs.  But Brits slammed Mr Sunak for dressing up the £ loan as a discount, highlighting that it must be paid back in £ instalments over the next five years. On hearing how much more she’ll be paying, Claire said: “Wow, how am I going to work this out to keep up with everything  “I don’t think I can economise more than I do. I’m just going to have to try to cut back on gas and electricityI can. And try to buy less food for me. “I have an electric cooker and gas central heating. I already make sure lights and other things are turned off, I don’t think I can do any more apart from not using any heating or electricity when I’m on my own at home when the kids are at school. “One of my boys has asthma, and I have some health problems. I always put my boys first, soI have to sit in the cold all day then I will, then I can turn on the heating just before I go and pick them up so the house is nice and warm when they come in.  “We’re already really struggling at the moment, but we are just about getting buy. I buy the cheapest foods that will last the longest at the supermarket, but I can’t really give them any treats, even a bar of chocolate. “I’m already on the edge to be honest, I wouldn’t know where to find even an extra £ on food or bills. Already I’m seeing food prices going up, and now this, I really don’t know what I’m going to do.” The confirmed rise in energy bills came just hours before the Bank of England confirmed a . per cent rise in interest rates, and will come into effect at the same time as a  per cent hike in National Insurance tax in April.

Almost , people were involved in clinical trials for the Novavax-made vaccine, called Nuvaxovid.  Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, said: “Nuvaxovid is distinct from other Covid- vaccines currently in use in the UK as it uses recombinant protein-based technology which has been used for many years in the development of vaccines to prevent other illnesses, for example, Hepatitis B.” Dr Clive Dix, former Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said: “This is excellent news as the clinical data on this vaccine is excellent and the strong cellular response should make this an excellent vaccine for boosting next winter. “Not only do we expect a strong durable response but also good stability at fridge temperature so it can be rolled out with the flu vaccine next winter as part of the winter campaign. “This should replace the need to buy more Pfizer and Moderna vaccine and save the UK government a considerable amount of money.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AstraZeneca plcPfizer Inc.Novavax Inc.The MedicinesFluCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We were getting drunk and having fun when my we told them that I had proposed to her outside this very restaurant all those years ago. My sister was p***ed and she stormed out. My we feels guilty for letting the cat out of the bag. My brother-in-law also feels that it was cheap of me to use his parentsapos money for a proposal. The man said his sister is now refusing to talk to him - but he thinks she should let it go. He said: Itaposs been weeks and my sister is still cold towards us. I told her it happened years ago and to just let it go. She said that she is hurt, and that was supposed to be her fabulous wedding. She says that the place and time is now memorable to us as the place we agreed to get married and that it will never be remembered as the place she actually got married. She was very mad that I hurt her feelings and now I am just asking her to let it go. Commenters on the Reddit post were largely on the manaposs side, as they said he would have been out of lineheaposd proposed in front of his sisteraposs wedding guests, but doing so discreetly was fine. One said: Normally I’d say youaposre the a**hole, but you didn’t do it publicly in front of everyone. You did it privately. Nobody had hurt feelings until now. While another added: I came in here expecting to say you were in the wrong, but in this case, I think your sister is making too big a deal of this. And a third posted: Your sister is acting immature. Your secret proposal does not in any way affect her marriage or memories. Sheaposs being dramatic and causing hostility for no good reason because no actual harm was done.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditProposalsengagedMarriageWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is the claim a woman has made on the site, askamanager.org, sharing a bizarre situation her husband has been facing at work.In the post, the woman explains that sheaposs just an amused bystander and wanted to get a manageraposs opinion. She goes on to say how her husband had been on a hiring committee and helped to select a new candidate for a job and the whole team was really impressed with the person they picked. However, the person that turned up to start work was nothing like he remembered.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The woman wrote: My husband works in IT and is on the leadership team at a midsized private company. He was part of a  that recently interviewed a number of folks for an open position on his team. They had a few candidates for a first and second round and had one make it to a third final round before an offer. John accepted the offer and started last week! Except … it’s not the John my husband remembers. My husband was confused. She went on to list all the things her husband found odd, including the man having dferent hair and wearing glasses and how John keeps talking about his three kids and we - while at the interview he said he was single. John can’t answer a number of questions that they previously discussed in the interview, things pretty pivotal to the position. Husband describes John as being aloof and pretty timid whereas John was confident and articulate when they interviewed him. He is convinced this is not the person they hired. The post continued to share how the husband had spoken to his boss Holly about the matter - and sheaposd agreed something was fishy. Husband just got off a call with Holly, their HR business partner, and the internal recruiter who sent the offer. They confirmed the right candidate was offered a job and agreed many things were odd. Another oddity revealed on that phone call … John didn’t know who Holly was she had to reintroduce herself and he asked about her role… Holly was on two of three rounds of interviews and they extensively reviewed their org chart and her role. Unclearthey are working out an error by the hiring committee HR or unravelling fraud. Eventually, HR and the legal team gave them the go-ahead to speak to John about the issues that had arisen. However, she claims that before they even got a chance to ask him what was going on, he simply quit the job on the spot and has been unreachable ever since. The husband is leaving the company soon, so heaposs not sure heaposll ever get to the bottom of what really happened, but the woman adds he has now discovered a lot about fake interviewing - sending someone  to pretend to be you at an interview. Commenting on the situation, the manager that runs the website added that theyaposd found the whole story highly erting and they agreed that interview fraud was indeed a real thing and had increased recently due to virtual interviewing.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Itaposs therefore somewhat unsurprising that, after breathless anticipation leading up to the launch, McDonaldaposs fans have been sharing their thoughts about the Chicken Big Mac Burger and whether or not it could ever live up to the instantly recognisable flavours of the OG.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Many reviews have so far been pretty positive, with ious happy customers hailing it in turn as a triumph,a banger, and the best thing since sliced bread. One particularly enamoured Instagram user wrote: I’ve been waiting for this day for so long that when my boyfriend suggested having the new Chicken Big Mac for dinner, of course, I wasn’t going to say no, It’s a solid   for me. It tastes incredible and needed to become a permanent addition to the menu.However, some have noted that itaposs quite a messy burger, with one person tweeting: chicken big mac is v delicious. but the chicken burgers are not the right shape for that stack. Absolute chaos eating it. All layers sliding. Another gave the gloried mayo chicken meal a so-so   ranking, remarking that their initial hesitations of the meal being a little dry do still stand, with the burger needing something extra to give it flavour and moisture. In a bid to combat said dryness - and in a move which could well help those grappling with the aforementioned sliding layers - one TikToker has advised their followers to dash the dry top bun, emphasising no one needs that in their lives. In a video that has since been viewed more than .K times at the time of writing, TikTok user Laura Crawford could be seen removing the seeded top bun before flipping the middle bun on top.Laura has declared the hack to be the best way to eat the Chicken Big Mac, and plenty of her followers are certainly interested in giving it a go. One even suggested replacing the top bun with a layer of fries, which may well be a step too far for some Maccies purists. Of course, numerous inevitable comparisons have been made to the beef Big Mac, with one huge fan asserting that ya don’t f*ck about with a classic. Others have argued that Big Mac sauce is much more suited towards beef than chicken, with one tweeting that it overpowers the chicken a bit. Another reflected that the burger would be better with the original McChicken sandwich Mayo in instead of the Big Mac sauce. However, in his recent review, the Mirroraposs Kyle OaposSullivan found that the sauce went very nicely indeed with the burger, writing: Just like any Big Mac, the first thing you taste is that creamy special sauce and it works incredibly well with the chicken. I was concerned about the Chicken Big Mac being too dry but to my surprise, it was moist enough and lashings of sauce were a bonus. Those keen to form their own opinions on the burger everyone is talking about will need to get down to their local drive-thru sharpish, with the temporary item only making a fleeting appearance on the menu up until March .

Some parents know instinctively what their baby should be called as soon as theyaposre born, others have had their list of names planned since childhood, and some can even take several weeks getting to know their offspring before coming up with a name.In some instances, baby names can lead to fall outs, especially when someone has had their heart set on a name for their whole le and then someone  comes in and beats them to it. One man has inadvertently found himself in that situation exactly, after it was revealed that one of his employees had wanted to call her child with the same name he and his we had chosen for their unborn baby. Taking to a website called Ask A Manager, the man explained that his employee has been huffy with him ever since learning what he plans to call his child, despite the fact he had no idea she even wanted it. My we is  weeks pregnant with our first child. We just made her pregnancy public to everyone. I manage a staff of nine, he wrote.One of them is upset because she heard me answer another staff member’s question about whether or not we have chosen a name. We have chosen a name which can be given to either a boy or a girl and has signicance to both our families. He went on to say that his staff member is upset because she too wants to use the name when she has kids, however sheaposs not currently pregnant, nor does she have any immediate plans to have children. Evenshe was pregnant, I don’t see why us using the name means she can’t, he added. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Ever since she heard me answer the question, she has been cold and huffy towards me. She won’t talk to me unless she has no other choice, and some of my other staff came to me because she is telling everyone who works here what a bad boss I am. However, he doesnapost feel like thereaposs anything he can do about the situation given that she is still doing all of her work to a high standard, while being professional and warm towards clients. The name won’t change so I’m not sure how to address this with my staff member, he concluded. Many others on the website responded to the manaposs concerns, with the majority seeming to agree that there was nothing to do, and she would simply have to get on with it. People are just super-weird about the name-sharing thing these days. Nobody’s going to care that baby Aidan shares a name with his momaposs bossapos kid. How often would it even come up  one commented. I miss the days when there were five Jenners, three Chrises and two Matts in every classroom AND WE LIKED IT. Another added: I absolutely do not believe that someone with this outlandish and irrational of a mindset is ing in a perfectly normal, productive, collaborative manner in every other aspect of her work. She is reaching so hard to create drama over literally nothing. That level of aggressive imaginary victimhood has got to be spilling out all over the place.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Sibongile Mude frequently takes to TikTok on her account, @sibs, to share videos from her bedroom window of the cars in question, and has even taken to sticking angry notes to their windows and windscreen in an attempt to dissuade the drivers from parking there again.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In one clip, Sibongile showed off the note she writes up, which read: Your parking is NOT okay. You have blocked in my car - in my driveway! I am now stuck!! While another message written by the stressed homeowner read: You have parked in front of my driveway. I need to park MY CAR. Sibongile and her friends have even confronted some of the drivers who happen toto their vehicle while the woman is filming, with one woman caught on camera telling them her parking was not a big deal. Explaining what the woman had said, Sibongile wrote in the comments of one video: Whataposs said ... aposYouaposre blocking my carapos and she said, aposItaposs not much of a big dealapos and then she told her, to do one ... plus other words l can not say.  Sibongile even shared one video which showed three dferent cars parked across the exit to her driveway on three separate days, and explained that some of them are there for hours. She wrote in the comments: Itaposs annoying because you guys only see  seconds, but some of these guys park for  to  hours, and we need in and out of our driveway quite often. Commenters on the womanaposs videos have come up with a iety of solutions to her problem, including asking the council to paint lines on the road in front of her driveway or placing cones down to deter people from parking. One person said: You might have to cover some or all the cost but I’m sure the local council can authorise white lines to help people realise there’s access needed.  While another added: Canapost you put some cones down to stop people parking there  Is it illegal to park across a driveway  Parking across a driveway is only illegalthere is a dropped kerb, but this has nothing to do with the restriction of access to the driveway itself and is in place because dropped kerbs are a no-go for parking. Evena vehicle is only partially covering a dropped kerb, the owner will be committing a driving offence and could be liable to receive a penalty of up to three points and a fine of up to £. However, parking close to a dropped kerb is not illegal, eventhis restricts access to a driveway.According to Confused, police are unlikely to get involved in cases where the parking over the dropped kerb stops you from moving your vehicle into your driveway, butthe parking issue stops you from leaving they may treat it as an anti-social behaviour offence.Anti-social behaviour is defined by the Crime and Disorder Actas: “Acting in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as the defendant.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

So when Bateman Solms tested positive for Covid while studying at St Andrews University in Scotland and was forced to stay in her bedroom and not use the communal facilities in her university halls of residence, the first response from staff at the halls was to deliver her a kettle and some teabags so she could make her own tea.Makes sense, right But the move completely baffled TikTok user Bateman, who is originally from the US, as she was left in stitches by the very British response to her crisis - which she only assumed was standard procedure, the Daily Star reports.

I emailed them today that my test results were positive and the very first thing that happened - you have to imagine, that this is like the standard procedure - the first thing they do is bring a kettle and tea to my room so that I can make myself tea without using the shared kitchen. They were like, she has Covid – first order of business – this girl needs to be able to make herself tea. I love that. Batemanaposs video has more than . million views, and many commenters insisted the kind gesture of giving the woman a kettle and teabags wasnapost strange at all and was actually good crisis management. One person said: Every crisis I have ever been a part of, step one is ‘right, shall I put the kettle on.apos And another wrote: Cup of tea makes everything better, hope you feel better soon. While a third commented: As a Brit - I am proud of that. Any crisis can be solved with a brew. Get better soon! Someone  also posted: Well, having a cuppa is critical care here.Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Declan Haughney, , along with another man, took his relative Peadar Doyle, , from his home to the Post Office in Hoseys, Ireland, on Friday, January . Haughney, of Pollerton Road, Carlow, appeared before a sitting of Carlow District Court on Wednesday and was granted bail, after six days in custody, the Irish Mirror reported. He has been charged with deception, whereby he is alleged to have attempted to withdraw the pension on two occasions. And on Wednesday, appearing before Judge Geraldine Carthy, the court heard that Haughney has now been charged with another alleged offence. He is charged with the alleged theft of groceries from the Raths Londis Plus store on Carlow’s Pollerton Road on January .  The court heard that Haughney made no reply after caution — when he was charged with the alleged offence outside the courtroom at am. The alleged theft occurred five days before Haughney is accused of entering Hosey’s Post Office in Carlow, where he’s alleged to have attempted to withdraw his uncle Peadar’s pension. Peadar was discovered dead at the premises — with his death ruled by a coroner to be from natural causes. Haughney is accused of entering the Post Office at .am where he “dishonestly induced by deception” a member of staff. It is alleged he did so by producing a social welfare card in the name of Peadar Doyle — in an attempt to collect a pension payment of €. He is further accused of the same offence — dishonestly inducing a member of staff at the same premises — at :am. Both charges are contrary to Section  of the Criminal JusticeAct, .  Haughney, who was brought to Carlow District Court in the custody of the Irish Prison Service yesterday, was granted bail, on a number of conditions. Judge Carthy ordered that the accused must obey a curfew of am to pm and that he must sign on three times a week at Carlow Garda station. He must also supply police with a working mobile phone number, and be contactable at all times. The court also heard that Haughney was ordered not to enter the vicinity of or into Hosey’s Post Office or Raths Londis. He must also “be of sober habits” and remain “intoxicant free,” the judge said. Consent was given to bail on condition that the accused enter into a bond of €, supplying a € cash lodgement of which to the court. The court heard the accused was not in a position to pay the amount at that stage, and he was therefore remanded back into custody until his bail can be taken up.

The new mum was not due until the end of the month but suddenly went into labour on Sunday during an -hour United Airlines flight between Accra, Ghana, and Washington, DC.Dr Stephen Ansah-Addo, who was heading home to the US, teamed up with a medically-trained member of the cabin crew and a nurse to deliver the baby boy in business class. But when it came to cutting the umbilical cord the makesht-midwives didnapost have any clamps so used string. The airline said the delivery was uneventful. Paramedics were waiting to take the exhausted mum and her child to a local hospital when the flight landed in Dulles International Airport.  The airline had also arranged for an employee to greet the mum with a balloon and a card that read On behalf of the United team at Washington Dulles, congratulations on your baby boy! Dr Ansah-Addo - who works as a dermatology resident at the University of Michigan - responded to calls from cabin crew for a doctor. He told ABC News: I couldn’t believe it was happening. But I was trying to stay calm. This is someone that really needed help, because there was nobody  there. This is the kind of medicine where you can make a dference in people’s lives. Fellow passenger Nancy Adobea Anane, during an interview on NBC News Now, said: We realised that behind me there was a woman in distress. The pilot mentioned thatthere were medical personnel on board they should come around and give us their assistance because someone needed help. Right behind the business class they converted it into an operation room of some sort and one of them said aposoh, I can see the head!apos They got really, really excited. And then the baby came out and it started crying and we were all elated. The mother was good and she was able to see the baby. It was my first time on United Airlines and trust me it was quite an eventful and beautul experience, she added.  Blogger Zhikay Ikejunior was also onboard and posted photos of the aftermath of the delivery on Twitter.He wrote: A Ghanaian doctor practising in the United States of America was the hero of the day.A United Airlines spokesperson told the Independent: We were especially thrilled to see the plane land with one extra, especially beautul, customer onboard.”The airline has since said that both the mother and the baby boy were doing well.

Ukraine’s troops are hunkered down in trenches being fired at daily but are under orders to hold the line and not give the Kremlin an excuse to start a war. On Wednesday The Mirror met the commander of Ukraine’s Army Oleksandr Syrskyi, a four-star General, at an air-strip outside Kyiv. He told us how Ukraine was defending against the growing Russian threat from its eastern flank, where there are , Russian troops and Belarus to the north, where there are , including Russian and local forces.  He said: “History shows that they may take any kind of action and carry out any provocation and we are ready for anything. “But we keep up with our ceasefire regime in order to prevent any provocation.” He stressed Ukraine’s forces are being shelled and shot at daily along the -mile trench frontier between his soldiers and pro-Russian separatists backed by Moscow’s regular forces.  General Syrskyi added: “I don’t think an attack from every direction is likely as Russian forces are ided up. They do not have enough troops. “But we are on high alert all of the time. Since  we have been in a state of permanent non-nuclear warfare. “The Ukraine armed forces are conducting covert operations, we are conducting reconnaissance, planning for every scenario.”  The Daily Mirror understands Moscow’s GRU spies have planted misinformation throughout east Ukraine, as they did in Crimea before the  invasion. Russian loyalists have been told “the Nazis are coming” in a ridiculous attack on Europe’s growing links to Ukraine, the suggestion being that the continent is anti-Russian. Spetsnaz special forces are planning “ flag” deception missions against Ukraine - either self-inflicted attacks triggering a retaliation and war or fake news. One likely scenario would be Russian separatists being attacked by covert Spetsnaz units pretending to be Ukrainian. This would spark a response from Moscow and give the needed pretext for an assault on its neighbour, which is massively supported by NATO.  As well as , NLAW anti-tank weapons the UK has supplied Ukraine with  military trainers- but Ukraine wants more. The General added that Ukraine has demanded more help from the UK. He said London has been given a shopping list of weaponry and defence systems, adding that the NLAWs are a great help and saying: “The NLAW is a good deterrent. “We are extremely happy with this support and for any help to deter the Russian Federation. “We are waiting for something  - we have sent a list of armaments and ammunition which we need and I really hope that they will supply this.“I want more and our Ministry of Defence, our government has conducted joint exercises with the British side and we reached several agreements.“This capacity will increase our capacity to fight and to win this war.” The Mirror understands from other sources that the shopping list includes mortar shells, artillery shells, more anti-tank missiles such as Javelin and NLAW, electronic warfare systems which can jam Russian weaponry and communications systems.  Ukraine’s Minister of Culture and Information Oleksandr Tkacheno, also at the airstrip, revealed Russia’s military is trying to disguise where its strengths are. He said: “There has been a lot of misinformation about the military and where it is. “In one area on the other side there were supposed to be thousands of tents but then we discovered that % of them were actually not manned. “They were covered in snow and this means they were empty. “This could affect our understanding of the level of threat and where that threat actually is. “When we are dealing with robber Russians you have to call them out. “Putin is not afraid. It’s important that western leaders take action as he is a typical robber.” In a reference to western sanctions and backing for Ukraine he added: “He needs to see real-time action.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him. Going forward, coming to us will suit him as he has an eye for a pass and an eye for a goal and is comfortable on both feet. He can go outside or inside and has a bit of pace.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

They shared a flat in Glasgow before Russell’s move to Racing  in the summer of  and remain close. “I wouldn’t say he’s a maverick – I would say he reads the game dferently to pretty much any other  in the world,” said Price earlier this week, as he looked ahead to Scotland kicking off their  Six Nations campaign with an eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup clash against England on Saturday. Price and Russell will almost certainly be named as Nos  and  in Gregor Townsend’s team when it is announced at lunchtime today. “The space he sees and the skillset he has that enables him to pull off certain moves – the chips, the long balls, the passes – makes him unique,” Price continued.  “It’s just him. He’s a world-class . For me, my job is to try and help facilitate that as much as I can.  “He’s always looking for space. We’ve got a good relationship where we know what each other is thinking most of the time, which obviously helps.” When Price first broke into the Scotland team back in , there was concern in some quarters that he was too much of a free-spirit to play alongside Russell – but the -year-old has matured into an important leader of the side. That earned him his call-up to last summer’s Lions tour, and he believes the trip took his game to the next level.  Now he is determined to use his Lions experience to help Scotland make the leap from plucky underdogs capable of one-off victories against the top teams into genuine contenders for the Six Nations title. “You can pick up on things here and there, maybe little comments that players from other nations may have made while we were in South Africa about how they approach certain aspects of a game,” he explained. “That could be quite valuable – but that works both ways in terms of the opposition maybe knowing what some of us Scottish players could be thinking at certain moments.” The key to success in the Six Nations is no secret: it is a sprint rather than a marathon, so it is essential to start fast and then accelerate. With that in mind, Price believes Scotland can learn from last year’s campaign when they finished fourth in the table despite famous wins in London and Paris. “We had that great win at Twickenham, which was the first in  odd years, and we were in a great position the following week against Wales in terms of score-line, but they got it by a point come the end,” he said. “Ireland, again, was a three-point game. So, its just about putting it all together now. “Getting victories on the board in week one and week two puts you in a good position on the table, so thats what we will be trying to do,” he continued. “Thats what were doing in training now fine tuning and getting ourselves right for the first game because you cant look past the first game, its massive.  “If you get four or five wins then youre knocking at the door on that last weekend to see where you finish up. Hopefully  we can put it all together by drawing on the experiences from last year and the year before, then we should be in a good place come the last weekend.  “From an inidual and team point of view, having the confidence and the belief that we can beat these teams comes from the fact that we have beaten these teams. “The belief is certainly there thatwe can go out and implement how we want to play and our game-plan then we have the players, the ability and the skill level to come away with victories. “I dont know whether its arrogance, but its definitely a belief, a confidence. “Theres depth in every position now, which maybe has been lacking at times in the past, so there are no excuses because weve got it all there, weve got the training facilities, weve got everything in place for us to perform.  “Theres a lot of guys in good form who are looking to go out there and enjoy it and hopefully get off to the best start possible.” "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13434097.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgows-trinity-tower-residents-homes-three-months","story":"Glasgow City Council has taken the step of writing to residents affected after contractors carrying out the necessary repair work to the Trinity College tower in Park Circus gave them an estimated period.While the council does not own the building, it wanted to write to residents to update them on long they could be affected for.Residents were evacuated on Saturday amid fears of falling masonry from the unsafe stone tower and it was feared then they would wait weeks tohome.Read more: Glasgow workplace parking fees could bring in £million Dozens Were forced to flee from the vicinity of the Trinity College building in the city’s Lyndoch Street on Saturday night after concerns were raised it could be damaged by high winds from Storm Malik. Park Circus residents were evacuated on Saturday following high winds An exclusion zone has been put around the building, and people living inside or in the vicinity were offered shelter at a rest centre in the nearby Kelvin Hall. Now the council has been told it could be two to three months befor work is completed.Read more: Trainspotting actor Robert Carlyles tears as he read poignant messages for Scotlands Covid memorialIn a letter to residents, a council spokeman said: \"The removal of the exclusion zone is entirely dependent on when the owners’ appointed design team and contractors will be able to complete adequate stabilisation work.\"I am afraid the council is unable to answer detailed questions about timeframes at this stage as we are not carrying out the work, however the contractors have indicated to us that the work will take in the region of two to three months.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn.

Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD .

He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

It is understood that an announcement could be made at around .pm this afternoon . The move means that deputy First Minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle ONeill, also loses her position as the two roles are a joint office shared between Stormont’s two biggest parties. Thereforeone leader resigns, the other leader’s resignation is also triggered. It is understood that the Executive will continue toas other ministers will remain in place to run their departments.

Similarly, an energy scheme which would see , people receive a pound grant would be thrown into jeopardy while a scheduled apology for victims of historical abuse would be in doubt. Legislation which is due to be completed at Westminster next week will allow the Assembly to continue for between six and nine months without an election. The SDLP’s Upper Bann MLA, Dolores Kellysaid the DUP’s actions “represent a gross betrayal of people in Northern Ireland”. “Whatever community you’re from, whatever your background or beliefs, no one benefits from this cynical, and totally predictable, electioneering stunt,” she said. She added that the DUPs MLAs need to explain to people in our community, people who are struggling to cope with rising energy bills and to put food on the table, those and their loved ones who are facing an eternity on hospital waiting lists, people who are struggling to access a decent education for their children, why the DUP has done this at a critical juncture for politics here. The truth is that for the DUP, the party will always come first and ordinary people come last, she said. “This DUP drama has been concocted by Jeffrey Donaldson as a last desperate attempt to resuscitate their flagging poll numbers ahead of an Assembly election in May. We’ve come to expect shameless stunts from the DUP but putting ordinary people in the firing line is unforgivable. “People deserve better than a choice between bad government or no government. That has been the cycle of the last fteen years and it has delivered nothing but failure.

Thereforeone leader resigns, the other leader’s resignation is also triggered. It is understood that the Executive will continue toas other ministers will remain in place to run their departments.

Legislation which is due to be completed at Westminster next week will allow the Assembly to continue for between six and nine months without an election. Speaking at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Mr Givan said the “institutions are being tested once again and the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew’s agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom government and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol”. He added, “The consent principal is a cornerstone of the Belfast Agreement, and it is my earnest desire that all sections of the community will be able to give consent to the restoration of a fully ing Executive through the resolution of the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point.” Mr Givan said that being First Minister had been the “privilege of my letime”. He added that when he began in politics  years ago he “never expected to serve the people of Northern Ireland as first minister”. The Lagan Valley MLA said that “over the past eight months, working with the deputy First Minister, we have made progress that will improve our society. “ Earlier, Sinn Feacutein president Mary Lou McDonald said “we cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a ing executive”, adding that her party would not facilitate this. “In the absence of a ing executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say,” she said. “We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre.” Speaking at the same press conference, Ms ONeill said the actions of the DUP were a deliberate act of harm”. Meanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie has said that the DUP have shown no leadership whatsoever. If theres changes to the protocol in the coming weeks or months, itll be because of the hard work done behind the scenes to get those through negotiations. It will not be done by a minister resigning from their post. The DUP leadership’s actions “represent a gross betrayal of people in Northern Ireland,” according to SDLP leader Colm Eastwood. Resigning from government when people are struggling to provide for their families, heat their homes and deal with the cost of living tells you all you need to know about the DUP - for them the party will always come first and ordinary people come last, he added. People deserve better than a choice between bad government or no government. As for the Alliance Party, their deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said Mr Givan’s resignation would be “an act of huge harm”, adding that it was “a self-destructive approach by the DUP”. On the other hand, Jim Allister, the leader However, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voiceparty, which is not in the power-sharing coalition, said Mr Givans resignation would be better late than never. Its the price of Stormont implementing a protocol that day-by-day is dismantling the union, Jim Allister said. It is a price no unionists can pay or should have ever had to pay. Speaking following the resignation of the first minister, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party had reminded the UK government of its promises. This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early  and have participated in the political institutions since then, he said. I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Irelands position in it."},{"url":null,"title":"dups edwin poots halting northern ireland port checks after legal advice from ex attorney general john larkin","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

He said it told him that approval for the sanitary and phytosanitarychecks at ports had not been obtained from the Executive, that Executive approval was required and that “a decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval”. The DUP minister said the advice said that “I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval”.When Mr Poots previously sought to stop work on building border posts in September , Ms King’s legal advice to the Executive led Mr Poots into a rapid U-turn where he allowed the posts to be built.As reported by this newspaper on Saturday, Ms King’s firm advice at the time was that such action would be unlawful on multiple levels and civil servants would not have to follow an order to break the law. Although the situation now dfers from  in several respects, the core part of the dispute is essentially unchanged.On Friday the FDA, the union which represents senior civil servants, wrote to the head of the Civil Service, Jayne Brady, requesting that officials be given “clear unambiguous guidance in the event of ministers issuing reckless and potentially illegal instructions”.At issue are two conflicting interpretations of the legality of Irish Sea border checks. The DUP argues that in the absence of explicit Executive authorisation for the checks, they are unlawful because the Good Friday Agreement requires all signicant or controversial decisions to be cleared by the Executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBrenda King.

what happens next","story":"Following Paul Givan’s resignation as First Minister, the Belfastlooks at what the next steps will be for Northern Ireland.What happens to Stormont now Paul Givan has stepped down The mandatory power sharing mechanisms in the Stormont Executive means that the First and deputy First Minister rely on each other to keep their post. In the first instance, Mr Givan’s resignation, effective at midnight, will cause Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill to immediately lose her post as deputy First Minister.Read MorePaul Givan resigns as First Minister, as DUP’s Donaldson says time for people to ‘have their say’Allison Morris:OpinionPaul Givan’s resignation as First Minister will have far-reaching consequences on Stormont legislationThis won’t cause Stormont to collapse immediately, however, as in the past a seven day period to renominate a First and deputy First Minister was allowed before the Assembly collapsed.This is now being changed to a six-week period.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Legislation that has almost passed through the House of Lords will also allow a cooling off period, preventing Stormont collapsing immediately.Other Executive Ministers can remain in post during this time to run their departments, but they are unable to take any new decisions as the First and deputy First Ministers chair meetings of the Stormont Executive.The Assembly can also continue toby passing legislation during this time.How does this affect me At present, an Assembly election is not due to take place until May  but collapsing Stormont could bring this forward.This means that several outstanding matters will not be dealt with by the Executive in the current mandate.Agreeing Stormont’s draft budget for the next three years could face delays, creating uncertainty for many sectors looking to plan ahead like health and education.The possibility of easing Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland was due to be considered at the Executive’s next meeting on February .For victims of Historical Institutional Abuse, an official public apology to be delivered by the First and Deputy First Ministers has been scheduled for March .Cancelling or postponing such an event at short notice has the potential to cause offence to victims.A DUP resignation may also mean a new victims’ commissioner could not be appointed.Why has this happened  The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson first made a threat to collapse the Stormont institutions back in September in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol.News of Mr Givan’s intention to resign comes after the DUP agriculture minister Edwin Poots ordered post-Brexit checks on food and farm products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain to stop at midnight on Wednesday.Related topicsNI ProtocolPaul GivanMore On NI ProtocolNI Protocol:

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help.

Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Holding this office is one that comes with a heavy responsibility and I have often felt the weight of this burden, to do what is right for all our people. “Working together as a five party Executive has its challenges but over the past eight months, working with the deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, we made progress and have made a dference that will improve our society. Since June last year the Executive has brought forward  new Bills including legislation that will strengthen the law against sexual offences, modernise the adoption process for children that need a family, tackle climate change and help save lives through organ donation.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To give people hope, to improve our communities, to make a dference for the betterment of all.“During this time we have taken over  key policy decisions and published strategies that will underpin future policy direction in areas that have included support for people struggling to meet the costs of living by extending welfare mitigations and the energy support scheme, ending Violence Against Women and Girls and providing refuge for Afghans fleeing persecution. We are driving forward the economy with the first City Growth deal signed for the Belfast Region worth over £bn that will create thousands of jobs and only last week we published Northern Ireland’s Investment Strategy. “All of the progress made has been in the context of managing a public health crisis as the Covid pandemic challenged us in ways that nobody expected when the virus first arrived nearly two years ago. I have been humbled by the sacrice and commitment of everyone who has gone the extra mile to get us through this testing time. Sadly thousands of people lost their lives and people have suffered in many ways but better days are ahead and we can look forward once again hopeful that springtime is coming and summer is on the way.“I am a committed devolutionist. I believe we as public servants to the people that elect us are best placed to find solutions to the many challenges we face by working together. What makes Northern Ireland great is the people and the values we share. Decency, compassion, respect, tolerance, helping others, improving our communities and with these shared values we can embrace our dferences when we show generosity towards the ersity that enriches the fabric of our society. The ability to stretch ourselves as politicians and go beyond what we find comfortable is what we need to dowe are to fulfil the potential of living in a truly shared and united society. I believe we can do that with leadership that transcends any one particular identity. “Our institutions are being tested once again and the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrews Agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom Government and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol. “The consent principle is a cornerstone of the Belfast Agreement and it is my earnest desire that all sections of the community will soon be able to give that consent to the restoration of a fully ing Executive through a resolution to the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point. “I want to thank Edwin for giving me this opportunity and Jeffrey who asked me to continue in the role when he became Party Leader. Most of all I want to thank my family, especially my we Emma. It is often those we are close to in our families that feel the pressure, even more so than those of us in front line politics. It wouldn’t have been possible without their support.“Thank you.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe move was announced as the Conservative administration at Westminster prepared to publish its Levelling Up white paper.Prime minister Boris Johnson, who has come under fire as a result of the “partygate” allegations, will attempt to ert attention from the ongoing saga by insisting the “defining mission” of his government is to “level up” the country so people have “access to the same opportunities” regardless of where in the UK they live.Levelling up secretary Michael Gove is to invite Wales first minister Mark Drakeford, as well as his Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon, and Paul Givan and Michelle O’Neill from Northern Ireland, to take part in the project, calling for the four nations to work together in the same way as they did in the Covid vaccine roll out.In addition, the Glasgow city region is to be one of three new Innovation Accelerator areas, and will receive a share of £ million of UK Government funding in a bid to encourage innovation and research and development work and boost local opportunities.Speaking ahead of the launch of the White Paper, the prime minister said: “From day one, the defining mission of this government has been to level up this country, to break the link between geography and destiny so that no matter where you live you have access to the same opportunities.”He added: “The challenges we face have been embedded over generations and cannot be dug out overnight, but this White Paper is the next crucial step.“It is a vision for the future that will see public spending on RD increased in every part of the country, transport connectivity improving, faster broadband in every community, le expectancies rising, violent crime falling, schools improving and private sector investment being unleashed.”.removeThe prime minister declared: “It is the most comprehensive, ambitious plan of its kind that this country has ever seen and it will ensure that the government continues to rise to the challenge and deliver for the people of the UK.”Mr Gove meanwhile described the UK as an “unparalleled success story with one of the world’s biggest and most dynamic economies”.However he stated: “Not everyone shares equally in the UK’s success. Great cities like Glasgow, Belfast, Swansea and Manchester, and proud towns from Aberystwyth to Armagh, to Bangor and Yeovil, have huge potential but contain inequalities which hold too many back.“Our ambitious plan to unite and level up the whole UK seeks to end that historic injustice and call time on the postcode lottery.”But he added: “We will only succeedall layers of government – UK, devolved, and local – work together.“We have seen through the success of the vaccine roll-out what we can achieve when we pull together.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPeople who suffer in childhood are also least likely to trust NHS information, wear masks during the pandemic or follow the rules, Welsh research has found.Adverse childhood experiencesinclude neglect, mistreatmentand growing up in a household affected by domestic violence, substance or alcohol abuse and other criminal justice problems.Parents separating or orcing, abandonment, or having a parent with a mental health condition are other examples of ACEs.The new study, published in the the open access journal BMJ Open, involved surveying , people aged  and over in Wales during lockdown restrictions .Experts looked at nine dferent ACEs as well as low trust in NHS Covid- information, whether people backed the removal of social distancing and mandatory face coverings, breaking Covid rules and vaccine hesitancy .While  per cent of those in the study had not experienced any childhood trauma, around one in five had suffered one type, around one in sixreported two to three, and one in reported four or more.The results showed that the more trauma people had experienced in childhood, the more likely they were to mistrust NHS Covid- information, to feel unfairly restricted by the Government and to support the end of mandatory face masks.The nine ACEs included in the study were: physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, parental separation, exposure to domestic violence and living with a household member with mental illness, alcohol and or drug misuse, or a family member in prison.People were twice as likely to break Covid rulesthey had four or more ACEs compared with none, while vaccine hesitancy was threefold higher with more than four ACEs compared with none..removeMore than four ACEs were also associated with a desire to scrap social distancing.Vaccine hesitancy was estimated at  per cent for those aged  to  with more than four ACEs, though older age groups were much more likely to have a vaccine. Overall, eight per cent of the entire study group would not agree to a vaccine.Around a quarter of all those in the study also admitted to at least occasionally breaking the rules.The authors concluded: “While pandemic responses should consider how best to reach those suffering from ACEs, longer term, better compliance with public health advice is another reason to invest in safe and secure childhoods for all children.”Previous research has suggested that mistreatment as a child may undermine trust in the future, including of health and other public services.The latest study suggested thatpeople had mistrust in one area, this was replicated in other areas.For example, four out of  people reporting low levels of trust in NHS Covid- information also reported vaccine hesitancy, compared with just six per cent of those who did trust this source of information.The study was funded by Public Health Wales and carried out by public health experts.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Officers are also of the view the proposal is incompatible with the existing economic development use and and would prejudice its future use.Civic CentreThe site is approximately .km south west of Bleary and fronts onto the Ballyduggan Road.The planning officer’s report notes the dog kennelbusiness is licensed for up to  dogs at any one time and says Council’s environmental health department has advised there are “insurmountable dficulties” associated with the proposed development by virtue of noise, odour and light overspill.Similarly, the report notes Council’s environmental health team feel the existing business is incompatible with the proposed dwellings and is likely to generate future amenity complaints.Councillor Kevin Savage askedthe committee were to approve the application, could there theoretically be an enforcement case brought against the existing business by the residents of these properties.A planning officer said while it is unlikely any enforcement could be taken against the licensed business, there would be nothing stopping the theoretical residents of these properties making a nuisance complaint which could require investigation by the environmental health team.Alderman Gareth Wilson askedthere had been any complaints from existing residents about the dogs barking andso what action was taken.A representative of Council’s environmental health team said they were unaware of any other complaints but said the nearest residents are further away than the applicant’s proposed site.Councillor Sam Nicholson askedthe dogs were there first do the dwellings not come second and its simply a case of ‘buyer beware’.“We have an infill site that is suitable as an infill site here but unfortunately these people are being hindered by an existing dog business,” he said.He was told that any future resident could make a noise complaint and this could lead to possible action being taken against the business under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act.Councillor Darren McNally askedmitigation measures had been discussed with the applicant or agent. Aplanning officer told the chamber the agent was made aware of the concerns and was given an opportunity to submit mitigation measure.“He did submit a concept layout showing a planted bank along the boundary and we forwarded that to environmental health,” said the officer.“In consideration of what was being proposed we didn’t feel it overcame our concerns with regards to noise, odour or light overspill. The mitigation proposed did not, we feel, overcome the concerns we had.”Council’s environmental health officersaid the applicant does not have control over the kennels and explained the main mitigation in this scenario would be increased sound insulation of the kennels and an increased separationdistance.Councillor Tim McClelland askedthe typography of the site and the prevailing wind direction would help reduce any odour concerns.He was advised planning officers were “not sure” the typographyof the site would provide natural mitigation and the environmental health officer explained the prevailing wind direction is south-westerly so any smell from the site would be blown towards the proposed residential area.Alderman Sydney Anderson askedthe committee had dealt with any similar applications previously and was told some similar issues were raised in an application approximately  months ago.Following Council’s decision to refuse that application, the decision is with the Planning Appeals Commission at present.Councillor Sam Nicholson said he was involved in the application being referred to and asked for that to be noted.Councillor Keven Savage said it was not often you get an infill site that ticks all the boxes in terms of planning policy but then falls foul of something .“Our main consideration has to be the amenity,” said Cllr Savage.“There are ‘insurmountabledficulties’ so to me that means there are no mitigations that can be put in place and I am veering towards regrettablyaccepting the recommendation as outlined.“We could be opening a can of worms by approving this.”The Chair of the committee, Councillor Peter Lavery said he was of a similar view and Councillor Sam Nicholson said he is asking himselfcommittee would approve the dog kennel had the houses already been there.Alderman Gareth Wilson said he was of the same view as Cllr Nicholson and Cllr Darren McNally said he was conflicted on this particularapplication and expressed disappointment neither the applicant or agent had appeared before the committee.“I would have felt more comfortable asking them to go away and work on other mitigation measures but since no-one is here I think our hands are tied,” said Cllr McNally.“That is a pity because I think it does tick every other box.”A proposal to accept the recommendation to refuse the application was put forward by Councillor Kevin Savage and seconded by the committee’s Chair, Councillor Peter Lavery.Kevin SavageCraigavon Borough Council  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCustomers go ‘Loco’ after IT ticket mix-up at bingo event le...NewsPolice find ammunition in M vehicle check...NewsLarne man was growing cannabis at his home for ‘pain relief’...News Popular Lurgan pastor Jim Fugard has died after a short illn...NewsPolice investigate attempted murder in Lisburn...NewsMost PopularBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, thes...RecommendedInk cartridges: how to save money on printer ink cartridge a...RecommendedEmma takes on Hospice Support Group role...RecommendedValentine’s Day UK  flowers: roses, Lego, MS -

The move means that deputy First Minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle ONeill, also loses her position as the two roles are a joint office shared between Stormont’s two biggest parties. Thereforeone leader resigns, the other leader’s resignation is also triggered. It is understood that the Executive will continue toas other ministers will remain in place to run their departments. However, as there would be no First or Deputy First Minister in place, no new decisions could take place. That would mean that the current COVID- restrictions, including the wearing of masks would remain in place for the forseeable. Similarly, an energy scheme which would see , people receive a pound grant would be thrown into jeopardy while there is doubt over whether a scheduled apology for victims of historical sexual abuse will be made. Legislation which is due to be completed at Westminster next week will allow the Assembly to continue for between six and nine months without an election. Speaking at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Mr Givan said the “institutions are being tested once again and the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew’s agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom government and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol”. He added, “The consent principal is a cornerstone of the Belfast Agreement, and it is my earnest desire that all sections of the community will be able to give consent to the restoration of a fully ing Executive through the resolution of the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point.” Mr Givan said that being First Minister had been the “privilege of my letime”. He added that when he began in politics  years ago he “never expected to serve the people of Northern Ireland as first minister”. The Lagan Valley MLA said that “over the past eight months, working with the deputy First Minister, we have made progress that will improve our society. “ Earlier, Sinn Feacutein president Mary Lou McDonald said “we cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a ing executive”, adding that her party would not facilitate this. “In the absence of a ing executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say,” she said. “We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre.” Speaking at the same press conference, Ms ONeill said the actions of the DUP were a deliberate act of harm”. Meanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie has said that the DUP have shown no leadership whatsoever. If theres changes to the protocol in the coming weeks or months, itll be because of the hard work done behind the scenes to get those through negotiations. It will not be done by a minister resigning from their post. The DUP leadership’s actions “represent a gross betrayal of people in Northern Ireland,” according to SDLP leader Colm Eastwood. Resigning from government when people are struggling to provide for their families, heat their homes and deal with the cost of living tells you all you need to know about the DUP - for them the party will always come first and ordinary people come last, he added. People deserve better than a choice between bad government or no government. As for the Alliance Party, their deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said Mr Givan’s resignation would be “an act of huge harm”, adding that it was “a self-destructive approach by the DUP”. On the other hand, Jim Allister, the leader However, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voiceparty, which is not in the power-sharing coalition, said Mr Givans resignation would be better late than never. Its the price of Stormont implementing a protocol that day-by-day is dismantling the union, Jim Allister said. It is a price no unionists can pay or should have ever had to pay. Speaking following the resignation of the first minister, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party had reminded the UK government of its promises. This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early  and have participated in the political institutions since then, he said. I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Irelands position in it.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aafbcdabedb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebcefadbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1643906960615.jpg--northern_ireland_first_ninister_givan_resigns.jpg?164390696000","title":"northern ireland first ninister givan resigns ","story":"THE DUPs Paul Givan has announced he will resign as first minister of Northern Ireland.
