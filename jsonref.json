The pup was looked after by presenter John Noakes, until the pooch\u0027s death in 1971. Blue Peter then introduced Shep to its studios, arguably the most beloved of the brood to date. The Border Collie was the long-time companion of Noakes following the death of Patch, and the pair were inseparable.

As became tradition, her name was chosen by viewers.Goldie was the first in a long line of Golden Retrievers to appear on the show, including one of her puppies, Bonnie, who joined in 1986.The new mother left the show shortly after giving birth, and went to live with Groom on his Derbyshire farm.Bonnie then took up the mantle - and appeared with 16 different presenters on 1,150 editions of Blue Peter.The show\u0027s second Border Collie, Mabel, joined the show when she was just six months old in 1996, after being rescued by the RSPCA in south London.She became the longest serving pet since Petra, and was recognisable for having heterochromatic eyes (one blue and one brown) and distinctive ears.Mabel frequented the show alongside Lucy, a pedigree Golden Retriever who joined in 1998.Both Mabel and Lucy passed away within a month of each other in 2011, having served on the show for 14 and 12 years respectively.

A suite, where Kate is believed to have given birth, is thought to cost closer to £7,500.How much does the baby weigh?The baby weighs 8lbs and 9oz, just two ounces more than his cousin, Prince Louis. In fact, Pippa’s son is heavier than all of his Royal cousins, with George weighing in at 8lbs 6oz and Princess Charlotte at 8lbs 3oz.Until Louis was born, George was the heaviest future king in 100 years, and while Louis has taken that title from his older brother, Pippa’s son can boast that he in turn is heavier than him.Pippa’s son is much heavier than his uncles, with Prince William hitting 7lbs 1.5oz back in 1982 and Prince Harry coming in at 6lbs 14oz in 1984.What will the baby be called?No name has been announced so far, but a couple of the names Pippa and her husband James could go for are their father’s names: Michael and David respectively.Who is Pippa Middleton’s husband James Matthews?Pippa’s husband is the financier James Matthews.

Pregnant...Share this article    Prince Harry has ignored the torrential rain to deliver an inspiring speech dedicated to Australia\u0027s struggling farmers          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park on Wednesday afternoon where a huge crowd had turned out to see the royal couple           The couple\u0027s trip to central New South Wales drew  came just days after the announcement that Meghan (pictured) is pregnant          An excited crowd of 15,000 locals turned out to get up close and personal with the royal couple in the wake of their pregnancy announcement \u0027Sixty-four years ago my grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were right here visiting all of you. It\u0027s a great pleasure to be able to visit this area now and be able to report back how much life has changed in the Great Western plains region since then,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech at Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park.  \u0027Coming here brings back memories of 2003 when I spent some time on a small 16,000 hectare property in Roma in Queensland chasing cows through the bush... and it was great - I perfected the great Aussie salute.\u0027The greatest part about visiting country Australia is the people. You are the salt to of the earth: honest, hardworking and as tough as they come. That resilience, sense of humour and commitment to the land are what make you unique.\u0027You are the backbone of this country.\u0027 To laughter from the crowd, the drenched prince said: \u0027Despite recent welcome rain, it is going to take a lot more and a long time to recover.\u0027You are all the toughest people out there, the most persistent, the ones who can weather the storm or the drought.\u0027Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, in reference to the devastating drought.\u0027It must be hard not to lose hope when you endure so many dry months knowing you are powerless to do anything about it,\u0027 the Duke of Sussex said.\u0027The rich traditions of the Australian outback are legendary. You have a lot to be proud of. But I know that life has not been easy. You have just lived through two years of drought.\u0027And despite welcome rain it\u0027s going to take a lot more and a long time to recover. \u0027People in many farming communities generally don\u0027t feed themselves before they need, they are often more isolated, social networks are smaller and there is still a stigma surrounding mental health.          Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, mentioning the devastating drought          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were gifted a boomerang after his speech during the couple\u0027s visit to Dubbo          Prince Harry pretends to throw a boomerang gifted to him after his speech in Dubbo, in regional New South Wales          Prince Harry tries to encourage a jumping dog to scale a wall during his visit to Dubbo          Harry and Meghan began their visit by watching a display of jumping dogs – with the Duke trying his hand at beckoning a canine over a wall\u0027We know that suicide rates in rural and remote areas are greater than in urban populations and this may especially be true among young men in remote regions.\u0027But outside all of that, here\u0027s what I also know. You are one huge community and with that comes an unparalleled level of internal support and understanding.   \u0027All you need to do is ask for it... chances are they may well be suffering too, and will relish the opportunity to either listen or talk themselves. You need to know a part of being strong and tough is having the courage to ask for help when you need it. You must not silently suffer.\u0027If I may speak personally, we are all in this together, because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I ever made. You will be continually amazed how life changes for the better.\u0027Prince Harry said the royal couple have been \u0027impressed and inspired\u0027 by stories of Australians rallying together to help one another during adversity.\u0027Your culture of mateship and reputation for looking out for each other ensures that when people are ready to ask for help they will be heard.\u0027          Prince Harry said the royal couple have been \u0027impressed and inspired\u0027 by stories of Australians rallying together to help one another during adversity          The couple received an array of gifts during their visit, from traditional clapping sticks offered by dignitaries through to a can of Dubbo Royale lager          Prince Harry and Meghan visit the Clontarf Foundation and Girls Academy at Dubbo College during the couple\u0027s royal tourHe said the couple had enjoyed their time in Dubbo, known as the \u0027city of smiles\u0027.\u0027Dubbo, I am told is now a popular tourist destination renowned for its zoo, festivals, boutique wineries and the old Dubbo jail. \u0027The quality of lives and shared values of people here in rural and regional Australia are very special.\u0027 Harry and Meghan began their visit by watching a display of jumping dogs – with the Duke trying his hand at beckoning a canine over a wall – before meeting members of Team Rubicon, an organisation for veterans which uses disaster response to help former service people back into civilian life.The couple received an array of gifts during their visit, from traditional Aboriginal clapping sticks offered by dignitaries, through to a can of Dubbo Royale lager designed for their visit.Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorSix vehicles involved in major pile-pub on the M40 North boundCollege students run to safety after pupil opens fire in CrimeaWhite woman that questioned her black neighbor defends herselfMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Banksy shreds Girl With Balloon artwork in rehearsalEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clash over Brexit at PMQsKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fake    Five-year-old Luke Vincent managed to stroke Prince Harry\u0027s beard after the royal arrived in Dubbo, stealing the show after the royal couple shook hands with every single student on the tarmac          Luke, who was among schoolchildren who greeted the royal couple at Dubbo Airport on Wednesday morning, received a hug from Prince Harry           The kindergarten student had waited at the very end of the line to met the royal couple who are spending Wednesday in the regional city of Dubbo\u0027We gave him a can of special brew,\u0027 said Peter West, 62, from the city.\u0027It\u0027s a mixture from her town in America and his in England.\u0027It\u0027s beautiful.

Luke\u0027s favourite person in the world is Santa Claus, who has a beard. So he rubbed Harry\u0027s beard,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s been a wonderful experience for these little country kids to meet people they\u0027ve only ever seen on TV.\u0027            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a new best friend when they touched down in the drought-stricken regional city          The Duke and Duchess spent time with Luke after they arrived in Dubbo for the second full day of their Australian tour           The royal couple were visibly delighted to meet with five-year-old Luke during their tour of Dubbo in Wednesday           The youngster, who was sporting green glasses and a checkered cap with his school uniform, had also handed the Duchess of Sussex a bouquet of flowers          Luke\u0027s school uploaded a picture of the youngster travelling on the bus on the way to meet the royal couple at the airportForecast rain held off while the children jumped up and down with anticipation, cheering as the couple came down the steps from their RAAF jet for the second full day of their royal tour.Despite running behind schedule, Harry and Meghan took their time with the school children, the Prince bouncing around energetically and Meghan kneeling down to speak to them.Ms Van Dartel said of the royal couple\u0027s visit to Dubbo, whose farming community has been hit by the devastating drought in recent months: \u0027This is a real morale boost\u0027.James Fogg, 11, from Eumungerie Public School, which has just nine pupils, told Harry he wanted to be a helicopter pilot, with the Duke replying: \u0027Good choice, good man\u0027. \u0027This is so exciting for Dubbo.

Prince Harry was wearing a grey-blue shirt and trousers. Also in the line-up was Troy Grant MP, the member for Dubbo and minister for police and emergency services, and his wife Toni.Previous royal visitors to Dubbo have included Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1920, the Queen in 1954 and 1992 and Prince Edward in 2006.   The farming region got barely any rain through the winter and has been blighted by temperatures in excess of 45C leading to the death of thousands of cattle, loss of livelihood and severe food shortages. Some areas have experienced the driest spell since records began in 1900. Prince Harry and Meghan  visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service after their arrival to learn more about the life-saving role the aviation service provides for people living in remote areas.   There, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a hero medic who pulled three survivors from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex unveiled a new aircraft for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while in Dubbo          The royal couple were greeted by signs including \u0027Dubbo loves Harry and Meghan\u0027 as they toured the Royal Flying Doctor Service\u0027s Dubbo facility           Before leaving the Royal Flying Doctor Service facility in Dubbo, the couple cut a cake marking the 90th anniversary of the serviceMarcus Wilson, 47, an ex-soldier who was running a medical service at the time, was awarded Australia\u0027s Bravery Medal for his actions. Inspired by Prince Harry, Mr Wilson will be taking part in the Invictus Games in the sailing event.Now manager of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Broken Hill, about 1500 km from Sydney, Mr Wilson spent 14 years in the military - first as a gunner, then as a medic - before setting up a medical evacuation service for aid workers in Afghanistan.He was at NATO HQ in Kabul in October 2015 when a helicopter crashed near where he was standing.\u0027It missed me by 15-20 feet,\u0027 Mr Wilson, who met the couple at a RFDS event in Dubbo, said. \u0027It was an intense experience.\u0027I was the first on the scene. I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire - there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.           Dubbo crowds await the arrival of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a picnic in Victoria Park          The hundreds of people had waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the royal couple in the regional city \u0027I had had a chance to live my life. I didn\u0027t want other people to take the risk that I felt I should take.\u0027Medically discharged from the army because of a spinal injury, and traumatised by the helicopter crash, Mr Wilson found himself at a loss after leaving Afghanistan. Then he watched the Invictus Games in Toronto, and volunteered for the Sydney games. \u0027I have seen how much it has impacted not just on me but other team members and their families,\u0027 Mr Wilson said.At the RFDS event, which saw a new aircraft being delivered as the service marked its 90th anniversary, the Duke and Duchess also met patients including Keiley Storer, three, who has suffered from a larynx condition which blocks her airway.She gave the Duchess a posy. It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, \u0027Would you like one too?\u0027 and gave her the white one. Then she saw Keiley looking and said, \u0027Would you like the big pink one?\u0027\u0027But Keiley got distressed that she pulled apart the posy.\u0027Her father Christopher said: \u0027She shed some tears shortly after. It was, \u0027Oh no, my posy\u0027.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are showing their support for farming families affected by one of Australia\u0027s worst ever droughts while in Dubbo          The family explained how they have adapted to the drought, before inviting Harry and Meghan for morning tea at the homestead with their family          The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorSix vehicles involved in major pile-pub on the M40 North boundCollege students run to safety after pupil opens fire in CrimeaWhite woman that questioned her black neighbor defends herselfMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Banksy shreds Girl With Balloon artwork in rehearsalEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clash over Brexit at PMQsKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fakeThe couple also met nurses and other staff and volunteers from the service. David Charlton, RFDS aviation general manager, said told the expecting couple that they deliver babies mid-flight several times each year.\u0027Our staff thought at was quite interesting, given the couple\u0027s current condition. The couple found it most amusing, and interesting. We all wanted to ask if it was a boy or a girl, but everyone behaved themselves.\u0027Before leaving, the couple cut a cake marking the anniversary. Harry gave it a good sniff, and helped himself to a bit of icing. \u0027He licked the icing from the knife,\u0027 Mr Charlton said. \u0027Which in Australian parlance \u0027is going straight to the pool room\u0027.\u0027The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887. Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm, including to the paddock where the Duke and Duchess had an opportunity to help feed the cattle.   Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm full time alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm          The Duchess of Sussex whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her on a visit to a farm to highlight the plight of farmers hit by drought          Pregnant Meghan, 37, cooked the delicious treat in the kitchen at Admiralty House on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in SydneyFollowing the rule that a guest should never arrive empty handed, the Duchess had whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her.Meghan, 37, cooked up the treat - an Australian favourite - in the kitchen at Admiralty House, the home of the Governor-General of Australia, on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in Sydney.She took the cake, packed with chocolate chips and a touch of ginger, with her to Mountain View Farm.An aide said: \u0027She loves baking and just decided to take something along with her on the spur of the moment.The duchess also took along the perfect accompaniment- a tin of Fortnum and Mason \u0027Royal Blend\u0027 tea.Before the Duchess had even left, only a quarter of the loaf remained.Benita Woodley, 20, the daughter of Scott and Elaine declared it delicious: \u0027It was such a nice and thoughtful thing for her to do.

Prince Harry, pictured in the Queensland outback in 2003, has very fond memories of rural AustraliaAfter graduating from Eton, Prince Harry, then 19, spent his gap year in 2003 working as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station, a sprawling 16,000 hectare cattle property 150 kilomtres northwest of Roma in outback Central Queensland.The station was owned at the time by Annie and Noel Hill, who were friends of his late mother Princess Diana.Mr Hill was the son of millionaire polo star Sinclair Hill, who coached Harry\u0027s father Prince Charles.Prince Harry spent three months working at the station and earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax.Working from 7.30am until 6pm, his duties include mustering cattle and mending fences, The Daily Telegraph reported at the time.He also found time to jet around Australia to a few Rugby World Cup games to cheer on his beloved England, who memorably won the tournament following a dramatic extra-time win against Australia in the final.

In the retail industry, this could mean the difference between profit and loss. The rise will hit stores of all sizes from corner shops to department chains, as well as manufacturers and white-collar firms.           General view of boarded up shops on Margate High Street, Kent.

It is time for the Chancellor to take a step back and support business through an unprecedented stimulus by freezing rate rises next April.’Mr Hammond faced pressure from his own backbenchers last night, with former Tory chairman Grant Shapps saying: ‘After years of struggle, the High Street deserves a boost and there’s no better place to start than ensuring a business rate-friendly Budget.’Fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘The Chancellor must scrap or curtail business rates for independent shops and they should also get tax breaks.’A spokesman for the Treasury said: ‘We’ve introduced more than £10billion of business rate support to help our high streets, so many bricks-and-mortar businesses now pay no rates at all. \u0027We’ve appointed an expert panel of industry leaders… to diagnose the issues affecting our high streets.’ Town centre that struggles... as nearby online fashion giant thrivesStruggling Barnsley shopkeepers facing crippling rate hikes yesterday told of their struggle to survive while business is booming for their neighbour – online clothing giant Asos.A few miles outside the South Yorkshire town centre stands the vast warehouse of the retailer that yesterday announced £2.4billion in revenues.While small firms on Barnsley’s dying high street have to pay out large proportions of their takings to cover rising business rates, the thriving online retailer paid only £1.1million for its Grimethorpe site where it employs 4,000 staff.Mark Rayner, manager of Ashworth and Bird men’s clothing shop in Barnsley, said it was impossible to compete with the retail giants: ‘Business is tough, footfall is down and it’s hard to make a profit.           Empty stores in Barnsley, where struggling shopkeepers facing crippling rate hikes yesterday told of their struggle to survive while business is booming for their neighbour – online clothing giant AsosYet for Julie and Wayne Chalkley, who run the Sofa and Bed Barn shop, staying open is still a challenge.They said: ‘Every day the druggies hang around in the alleyway.

What she uncovered, involving ‘serial’ offences by some MPs, is shocking. In a damning indictment of life at Westminster, Dame Laura pulls no punches, describing ‘a culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence, in which bullying, harassment and sexual harassment have been able to thrive and have long been tolerated and concealed.’MPs manspread their thighs to hide the gaps: QUENTIN LETTS...Tory MP Craig Mackinlay\u0027s 2015 election win \u0027would have been...Share this articleWe owe it to all those brave people who came forward not to sweep this under the carpet. Which is why you would expect Labour — with its long and honourable history of fighting for gender equality and the protection of employees — to be in the vanguard of those calling for the resignation of the Speaker.He is the one who has presided over this abusive culture, and is even now trying to cling on to office by hinting that he will step down quietly ... next year.It must be added that Mr Bercow himself has been accused of bullying staff — an allegation he firmly denies.          Ms Hoey accuses Mr Bercow, pictured, of presiding over the abusive culture and has even faced accusations of bullying staff, which he strongly denies If these allegations in Dame Laura’s report — including the groping of female staff — were made about staff in a private company, my colleagues on the Labour benches, normally so keen on women’s rights, would be clamouring for the chief executive’s head ... before breakfast. This is the party that likes to call itself progressive, even though it has never had a female leader, while the Conservatives have had two women Prime Ministers.So did Labour demand immediate action when the Speaker granted an urgent question on this matter in the Commons on Tuesday? Well, no. While female Tory MPs angrily called for Mr Bercow to step down, some Labour MPs, including Dame Margaret Beckett — a member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life — and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry seemed anxious to ensure his survival.Emily Thornberry said later on Sky News: ‘I think this is absolutely not the time to be changing Speaker.’The reason for such pusillanimity from Labour’s ranks of feminists became plain when Margaret Beckett admitted: ‘If it comes to it ... the most difficult decision we’ve made for hundreds of years trumps bad behaviour.’ She was of course referring to Brexit — which is the real reason the Speaker was let off the hook.          Ms Hoey criticised her fellow Labour MP Emily Thornberry, pictured, who believes Mr Bercow should remain in post until after Brexit For he is the pro-Remain controller of parliamentary business, and that means they are willing to ignore the blindingly obvious — that this discredited occupant of one of the highest offices in the land must go. And go now.The Speaker is meant to be a neutral figure, conducting business free of party political taint. As William Lenthall, a holder of that office, explained to Charles I: ‘May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me.’But Mr Bercow’s pedigree as a Remainer is undisputed — witness the sticker affixed to a car occupying his personal parking space earlier this year proclaiming ‘B*****KS TO BREXIT’. Indeed, he made no secret of his Remain sympathies while speaking to students back in 2017.He is, of course, entitled to his personal views, but as Speaker not only should he be impartial, he must be seen to be impartial. Betty Boothroyd, in my view a great Speaker, would never have allowed herself to get caught up in this kind of controversy. She put Parliamentary dignity before her own ego.We are now entering the closing scenes of the protracted and tortuous drama that is the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. After years of behind-closed-doors negotiations in Brussels and in Cabinet, Parliament is about to take centre stage.The role of Speaker will be central in this closing act, and his or her decisions matter. But the idea that Mr Bercow is uniquely qualified for this role through experience is ridiculous: all the Deputy Speakers are perfectly capable of taking over.          She also criticised Dame Margaret Beckett for her failure to call for Mr Bercow\u0027s resignationWith the publication of Dame Laura’s report on harassment and abuse in Parliament, we are beginning the cleansing of the Augean stables. The document makes sometimes painful reading: several offenders were named repeatedly by those who gave evidence (though not named in the report), and several departments kept cropping up, too. Witnesses spoke of a ‘macho culture’ in which women were not welcome. Female members of staff would be told to make the tea, or asked if they needed to work or had a husband. Shockingly, there were allegations of racial abuse, also.The human cost of this is all too clear. ‘People who believed themselves to be strong, capable iniduals suddenly found that they were unable to eat or sleep properly, or they were shouting at their children or partners, or were prone to sudden bouts of crying or panic attacks,’ writes Dame Laura.One of the 200 people interviewed privately by Dame Laura spoke movingly of her feelings, and neatly sums up what is at stake. ‘We are proud to work in the House of Commons, but when we are abused those who lead us should support us, not abandon us to our fate and cover up the traces. And those who abuse us should be held accountable.‘Establishing a new complaints and grievance process won’t come close to solving the problems in this place. We need a seismic shift. But the institution is worth fighting for.’I take no pleasure in supporting the call for the Speaker to step down. He has made some useful changes which have helped hold the Executive to account, but he himself must be held to account and, as the report makes clear, without real change at the top there is doubt that anything will change down the line. The right of people going about their daily work to be treated with dignity, free of abuse at the hands of the powerful, be it sexual or otherwise, cannot be ‘trumped’, in the words of Margaret Beckett, by any political consideration — even one as momentous as Brexit.‘It may be that some iniduals will want to think very carefully about whether they are the right people to press the reset button and to do what is required to deliver that change in the best interests of the House,’ says Dame Laura.No name is mentioned, but you don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to work out the identity of one of those she is talking about.Some years ago, I played a small part in the downfall of the previous Speaker, Michael Martin. This was during the MPs’ expenses row, when he sought to cover up the details. He was sensible enough to listen to voices of concern and was able to leave while still retaining some dignity. Speaker Bercow should do the same.But as long as the Remainers in Labour — including those women MPs who are normally obsessed with equality — turn a blind eye in the name of political expediency, then he will stay right where he is in the crucial months ahead."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/18/06/5168F0D300000578-6289085-The_Duchess_is_visiting_Melbourne_with_her_husband_Prince_Harry_-a-176_1539838982779.jpg","title":"A nervous looking Meghan Markle handballs football designer dress heels","story":"Meghan Markle has tried her hand at Australian Rules Football - and impressed onlookers with her impressive technique      Keep it chic like Meghan in a midi dress by Dion LeePre-order it here...It’s day three of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s Australian tour.

She did a handball. That\u0027s a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do.\u0027She had not seen an AFL football before Howard, the governor\u0027s husband, explained to her what it was like - the weight of it is a little bit different, and that you handball it, you don\u0027t pass it.\u0027 Before trying Australian Rules Football, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were introduced to some of Melbourne\u0027s brightest and most innovative young people at a reception hosted by the Governor of Victoria.The couple arrived at Government House for a Young Victorians Leaders reception approximately 25 minutes late after being stuck in traffic earlier that morning. But Harry and Meghan got straight to work when they were greeted by the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, and her husband Anthony QC, who took them inside for a private meeting.Ten minutes later the couple re-emerged and were escorted across Government House\u0027s West where they were able to see a display put on by Victoria\u0027s This Girl Can empowerment campaign, which encourages everyday women to get active however, wherever and whenever they want without being judged.The couple were presented with a display of 150 women showcasing a number of activities, including netball, yoga, boxercise, cricket, cycling and Zumba.

She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged. She has done a lot of work in the background with women\u0027s empowerment and it was good to see her coming along and seeing people in local communities making a change.\u0027After walking around the presentation, the couple - who had spit up to view different areas of the display - reunited to walk inside Government House to meet young people involved in a number of innovative and entrepreneurial programmes developed by young people in the Victoria region.First up was the Man Cave - a preventative mental health program for teenage boys, which was founded by Queens Young Leader Hunter Johnson.\u0027There\u0027s a familiar face,\u0027 Meghan said as she reached out to shake the CEO\u0027s hand. Harry also made a beeline to greet Johnson, who quickly thanked the Duke for his support.The conversation quickly turned to Harry\u0027s speech in Dubbo on Wednesday, where he delivered an emotional message to Australian farmers and opened up about depression and mental health issues.\u0027So many young much are suffering from these problems without even realising,\u0027 Harry remarked.Also representing Man Cave was 14-year-old Rupert Grant, a student from Melbourne Grammar School who had been involved with the programme through his school after experiencing a \u0027tough time\u0027 in school. After explaining how the programme had made an impact on life for him and his friends, Meghan remarked, \u0027You\u0027re quite the spokesman!\u0027          Prince Harry and Meghan started model Formula 1 cars at demonstration held at Government House in Melbourne          Harry and Meghan have now arrived at Government House, where they were greeted by Victorian Governor Linda Dessau\u0027We really need more global leaders like Harry,\u0027 Johnson later shared. \u0027There is a change happening among men now, a focus on healthy masculinity and having his support is a real badge of honour.\u0027I thanked Harry for his role modelling and leadership - and we spoke about his incredible words in Dubbo. When I said that the Duchess looked up him proudly.\u0027It\u0027s important that as men we address these issues, that we\u0027re not afraid to take the mask off and open up. To have started that conversation in Dubbo yesterday was powerful.\u0027He\u0027s a positive, glass half-full person and has an incredible influence on the younger generation. He is the right role model for young men and boys today.\u0027After meeting the team from Man Cave, the Duke and Duchess moved on to learn more about Aubot, a robot that can help hospitalised children continue to attend school and the disabled attend work.\u0027This is amazing,\u0027 Meghan commented as she waved a hand in front of one of the robots named after its founder and CEO Marita Chang.Harry seemed particularly interested in their next presentation - a vertical, edible \u0027farm\u0027 designed to grow inside Melbourne cafes, restaurants and, one day, people\u0027s homes. \u0027It will be interesting to see one day how this challenges the supermarkets if people are growing these in their homes,\u0027 Prince Harry said of Farmwall, which was co-founded by Melbourne-based Geert Hendrix.\u0027But I hope that these can be produced with farmers in mind too, so they can exist side by side.\u0027Added Meghan, \u0027I like that there is a focus on nutrients. I can see you have the sprouts, the micro greens... It\u0027s very clever.\u0027          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrive          Recently announced pregnant, Meghan removed her coat as the couple approached the steps of Government HouseThe couple\u0027s final presentation was by the team of Trinity Grammar School, who were part of the Formula 1 in Schools programme - an international STEM competition for schools in which students design and manufacture a miniature car out of an official F1 Model Block.Upon seeing the miniature F1 drag strip the students had built on the State Dining Room table, Harry joked, \u0027We should put one in Buckingham Palace.\u0027They were then offered to launch the two F1 race car models, however neither were expecting the loud air release from the hydraulics that launched the cars. \u0027I wasn\u0027t expecting that!\u0027 exclaimed Meghan, who jumped at the loud noise. Harry laughed.Following the innovation program displays, the Duke and Duchess were escorted by the Governor and her husband to the main reception in the Government House Ballroom, where approximately 350 young people representing the future of Victoria were gathered. The guests were from a broad range of backgrounds, including students, military personnel, entrepreneurs, charity volunteers and farmers.\u0027You are the future of our state - brilliant, innovative and inspiring,\u0027 Governor Dessau said in a welcome speech before the royal couple split up to socialise with the guests who had been grouped together.One of the first Meghan got to meet was Willow the golden Labrador, who was representing Guide Dogs Victoria. \u0027Ahh, everyone knows my achilles heel is dogs,\u0027 she cooed, before kneeling down to pet the \u0027ambassadog\u0027.          The crowd of about 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm for the pair, despite being slightly behind schedule          The couple departed Government House, visiting an Aboriginal artwork mural in Melbourne\u0027s Charcoal LaneTeam members from the guide dog charity thanked the duchess for visiting and gave her a small soft toy replica of the pooch, which she seemed very thankful for.Over the next 15 minutes and young bloggers focusing on a wide range of issues, including female empowerment.\u0027It\u0027s scary to open up but you realise how many people it helps,\u0027 Meghan told one of the girls, who runs a blog focused on mental health.The Duchess seemed particularly interested in the work of 22-year-old Sherry-Rose Bih, a charity volunteer and founder of WomenGirl, which aims to see young women and girls, regardless of their background or ethnicity, have access to knowledge and quality resources through which they can be empowered. \u0027You\u0027re really talking my language,\u0027 Meghan said after hearing her story.Bih later commented, \u0027I\u0027m particularly focused on helping women of colour as they still face so many barriers and I think the duchess was really interested.\u0027We need to create more paths for women, and when I said \u0027You can\u0027t be, what you can\u0027t see\u0027 she seemed to like that. The Duchess is a big role model to many.\u0027Harry, who had been working the opposite side of the room - meeting military personnel and volunteers at the Victoria Police force amongst many others - rejoined his wife to move to the final part of their visit in a formal reception space at Government House.          The rest of the day will hold significance for Harry and Meghan as they visit projects that align with their goals on the tour          One teenage fan, India Brown, let her emotions get the better of her, bursting into tears as Prince Harry offered up a hugThey were escorted by Premier Daniel Andrews and his wife Catherine, and stopped to talk to other senior parliamentary figures including Legislative Assembly Speaker Colin Brooks, Opposition Leader Matthew Guy and Legistlative Council Presidentt Bruce Atkinson.After short chats, the couple then moved into a guest conservatory to sign the Government House visitor\u0027s book. \u0027This has been a most inspiring afternoon,\u0027 the Duchess remarked to Premier Daniel Andrews. The Duchess of Sussex showed off her blossoming baby bump  as she met with youth leaders.Meghan stunned the crowd of thousands in Melbourne on Thursday, even driving some fans to tears of joy.The mother-to-be, wearing the Australian-made designer dress with a Martin Grant trench coat, beamed as she made her way through the city\u0027s Royal Botanic Gardens.In matching navy blue heels, the Duchess looked delighted to meet young Australians and was even handed a bouquet of flowers and a teddy bear for her future baby.Meanwhile, a teenage girl was seen bursting into tears as she was overcome by emotion after hugging Prince Harry.Despite the royal couple arriving 20 minutes late for their first engagement of the day, the crowd of around 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm, gripped by \u0027Meg-Mania\u0027.Heavy traffic on the Tullamarine Freeway, the main stretch of road that connects Melbourne Airport to the city, resulted in a slight detour via the Westgate Bridge.Among the crowd, hundreds offered flowers, teddy bears and gifts for the royal couple, with one young girl eager to tell the Duchess about her ballet.Many were carrying flowers and signs including two witty notices reading: \u0027Worth the detention\u0027 and the \u0027Fresh Prince with Red Hair\u0027.The day is set to hold special significance for both Meghan and Harry as they visit projects throughout the city that align with their goals on the tour, of encompassing the work of youth leadership, sustainability and meeting marginalised groups in society.

The stone came from the same mine in Senhora De Lima’s native Brazil which has provided aquamarines for the Queen.It was not just Diana who enjoyed a special link with the generous Lucia, so too did William and Harry. When she visited Kensington Palace she always brought something for the boys.\u0027Who\u0027s this little cutie?\u0027 What Prince Harry said when he...Meghan masters the art of the tour wardrobe! Pregnant...Share this articleIf it was money, it was often a £50 note. ‘Ooh, a pink Granny,’ the boys would exclaim excitedly, a reference to the Queen’s head on the banknote.Harry never forgot such kindness and, when he and William were making their plans for a statue of their mother as a permanent memorial, they sought the views of Sra De Lima.Sadly, she died last year before the project could be completed. But both boys knew how much she meant to their mother during the years she was in London as the wife of Brazil’s ambassador to the UK, and later in Washington when he was appointed envoy to the U.S.Diana would often talk to Lucia and other friends of her ‘precious boys’ — but particularly of Harry. She adored them both but William, destined to be King, was marked from birth for special attention.As compensation, Diana poured more love and attention into Harry. ‘I have to,’ she would often tell me. ‘Charles and I worked so hard to ensure both boys receive equal amounts of our time and love, but others in the family seem to concentrate on William.’            Princess Diana meets 91-year-old Nellie Corbett at the Lord Gage Centre in NewhamOne day she told me how matters had come to a head with the Queen Mother, with whom the Princess had always had an ambivalent relationship.Harry had complained that whenever he and William visited their great-grandmother at Clarence House, it was always William she made a fuss over and who sat next to her. ‘It’s not fair,’ Harry told his mother.Diana took it up with the Queen Mother explaining, as delicately as possible, that she would prefer it if she didn’t show favouritism to William. For her part, the Queen Mother argued that as William was heir to the throne he should be groomed as such. However, things did change a little. More than anything Diana didn’t want Harry to have a complex about his position in the family.She need not have worried, although slower at learning than William and more sensitive, Harry was a happy-go-lucky boy with a streak of curiosity.William, on the other hand, was slightly aloof, and this made him a little more serious and retiring.Diana empathised with her eldest son’s predicament. ‘He doesn’t want his every move watched,’ Diana would say.Whereas Harry’s attributes, she felt, were better suited for royal duty. She came up with the nickname Good King Harry, GKH for short, which she shared with a handful of friends.How Harry loved it when he was alone with Diana at Kensington Palace. Once, when home ill from boarding school, he gleefully told one of Diana’s friends: ‘I have got Mummy to myself . . . and I don’t have to share her with William!’Quite how many of his childhood memories from the Palace nursery Harry will recall as he becomes a father himself, remains to be seen. But there is one quality he is bound to want to replicate. Diana ensured that the domestic staff and police referred to the boys only by their first names, not as ‘Prince’ and never as ‘Your Royal Highness’.Says her friend Simone Simmons: ‘She knew they need to have a little dose of reality.’Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorSix vehicles involved in major pile-pub on the M40 North boundCollege students run to safety after pupil opens fire in CrimeaWhite woman that questioned her black neighbor defends herselfMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Banksy shreds Girl With Balloon artwork in rehearsalEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clash over Brexit at PMQsKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fake  Princess Diana in Vancouver, Canada (left) and the Duchess of Sussex in Sydney on Tuesday She smothered them in love and tried to give them an education outside the classroom — hence those visits to the homeless and the sick during their childhood.But for all her efforts how heart-breaking it was to hear Harry recall last year of the times after his parents’ break-up when ‘we never saw our mother enough or we never saw our father enough’.All the same, Diana considered motherhood to be her greatest achievement. As the years pass it is harder and harder to visualise the beautiful young woman who died at 36 as a grandmother four times over, but how she’d have loved to have imparted some of her wisdom to the women who married her sons.She would, of course, have understood Kate’s wish to have her own capable mother, Carole Middleton, on hand for the arrivals of George, Charlotte and Louis, and installed as ‘Granny Number One’.But it may have been impossible to keep her out of the nurseryafter Meghan gave birth. For Harry will be fulfilling a desire his mother once held — becoming parent to a mixed-race child.Diana’s dream was to have a baby with Hasnat Khan, the kindly Pakistan-born heart surgeon with whom she fell in love after watching him operate at London’s Royal Brompton Hospital.And if it was a girl so much the better. For Diana this was no idle fantasy. She believed a child with Muslim Khan could have far-reaching implications for the world. It would help, she reasoned, bring the Muslim and Christian worlds closer together.Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorSix vehicles involved in major pile-pub on the M40 North boundCollege students run to safety after pupil opens fire in CrimeaWhite woman that questioned her black neighbor defends herselfMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Banksy shreds Girl With Balloon artwork in rehearsalEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clash over Brexit at PMQsKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fake      With them in spirit: The Duchess wears Diana’s butterfly earrings at a Sydney reception            Honour the memory: Meghan also wore Diana\u0027s golden bracelet during the trip to AustraliaIt is tempting to wonder also how Diana would have handled the tragedy of Meghan’s father, the shock of his collusion with a photographer prior to the wedding, the embarrassing interviews and his isolation from his daughter.She treasured her own father and despite several significant differences, they never fell out. When Earl Spencer died suddenly at 68 in 1992, she was heartbroken and many have wondered if his absence helped precipitate her split from Charles that year.Her friends believe Diana would have been on the first flight for a rendezvous with Thomas Markle at his Mexican border hideaway to broker a reconciliation.In many ways, Meghan is the young woman Diana yearned to be, whose successes and achievements she earned for herself, not through marriage into the Royal Family. Despite the global fame it brought her, it was only after her split from Charles that she found a way to use that celebrity and turn it into a meaningful role.But no role would surely have surpassed that of grandmother.   Backups for every piece and detailed plans well in advance: Former royal maid reveals how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the tourShe has already wowed fans around the world with two outfit changes on the first official day of the royal tour.But it\u0027s not just the dresses that will be scrutinised over the coming 16 days, but every piece the Duchess of Sussex wears - from an artfully-placed folder to an item of jewellery that originally belonged to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. Former royal lady\u0027s maid, Alicia Healey, recently revealed how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the Invictus Games tour, and just how much preparation went into planning this event.

And, you know, microplastics are a real problem, especially the microplastics from fast-fashion. Did you know that\u0027s one of the biggest culprits?\u0027Bonnie Sheppard, 15, another Albert Park College student, said: \u0027Meghan was really interested in the effect of microplastics. I told her that there are more microplastics in the ocean than stars in the Milky Way, which she was surprised by.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s amazing what you guys are doing,\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027Well done, you\u0027re doing a really great job. Keep it up.\u0027   Harry and Meghan walk across the sand at South Melbourne Beach today as their extraordinary three-week tour of Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, and Fiji continues  Meghan and Harry wore jackets, coats and shoes as they crossed the white sands of South Melbourne beach today          Harry and Meghan have really enjoyed meeting young people in Australia who are also similarly enthusiastic          Harry puts his arm around his wife, who announced she was pregnant at the start of the Australian tour on Monday          As part of a day of more Aussie experiences the royal couple who patrol the beaches of Melbourne to keep people safe  Meghan speaks to a female lifeguard ahead of a litter pick where they warned about the use of plastics and throwaway fashions          Meghan and Harry speak to some local \u0027Waste Warriors\u0027 as they helped with a school plastic beach pick-up event          Before heading to the beach they greeted children warmly during their visit to the Albert Park Primary School          Harry kindly mimics a young girr excited to say hello to him as he visited Albert Park Primary          Meghan smiles and rubs a beautiful blonde baby among the thousands of people who came to see them in Melbourne today          Meghan returns a cheery wave to primary school children on day three of their 16-day tour of Australia and the South Pacifi          Morgan replied to Stefanovic\u0027s rant on Twitter, asking Stefanovic if he was \u0027after an honorary knighthood\u0027Piers Morgan has mocked Karl Stefanovic after the Today show host\u0027s extraordinary rant defending Meghan Markle.Morgan criticised the Duchess while hosting Good Morning Britain on Wednesday, saying she was \u0027acting\u0027 during her visit to Dubbo in regional New South Wales with Prince Harry.\u0027She is an actress. She\u0027s acting great at the moment,\u0027 Morgan said, adding that it was a \u0027red light when people behave like that, in an odd manner\u0027.Stefanovic hit back at Morgan during Thursday morning\u0027s Today show, saying his comments were \u0027disgraceful\u0027.\u0027I think she is an amazing, amazing woman and I think she\u0027s doing her very best at the moment, and she\u0027s got a lot on her plate and is doing it so beautifully,\u0027 Stefanovic said.\u0027She\u0027s such a great export for Great Britain, I mean - what is that guy on?\u0027Morgan replied to Stefanovic\u0027s outburst on Twitter, telling the Channel Nine presenter to \u0027pipe down\u0027.                                                    Carlo Foster, 12, an Albert Park Primary pupil, showed Harry and Meghan bags full of plastic cups, beakers and bottles he has collected. Harry said: \u0027Another worrying thing I\u0027m hearing is some people trying to claim things like these are actually habitats for fish and turtles. Don\u0027t ever let anyone convince you of that.\u0027The couple also spoke to Melisand Box, 14, from Albert Park College, who had a bag filled with plastic straws. She said: \u0027Harry told us to spread the message about whether people really need to use straws at all, and if they do, to use bamboo or metal straws.\u0027Harry and Meghan then did a \u0027mini-walkabout\u0027, greeting dozens of excited schoolchildren who had lined up on the beach to meet them. Among them was Amelia Marcom, 12, from St Kilda Primary school: \u0027I gave Meghan flowers, a picture of her and Harry I\u0027d drawn for them and some t-shirts for the baby. She said she loved them.\u0027Before leaving the beach, the couple strolled hand in hand down to the shoreline, to meet a group of lifeguards from Australia Surf Lifeguards. Sebastian Top, 20, a lifeguard for more than four years, asked Meghan, \u0027Are you going to swim today?\u0027 \u0027Maybe not today,\u0027 she laughed. Harry pointed to a group of around 30 people who had waded into the sea from the beach to get a better view of them: \u0027If we try and swim, I think they might be a bit of a hazard.\u0027 Showing they\u0027re not afraid to get their hands dirty, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will help local schoolchildren pick up litter from South Melbourne beach.Changing into a pair of  Rothy\u0027s flats and a matching black Miguellina Dress, Meghan and her husband made their way onto Melbourne\u0027s iconic mode of transport, along with student leaders at a local school. Arriving at the beach, the couple were fortunate to be greeted not only by roaring crowds, but also a bit of sunshine. Earlier, despite the royal couple arriving 20 minutes late for their first engagement of the day, the crowd of around 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm, gripped by \u0027Meg-Mania\u0027.           Harry and Meghan wave to the well-wishers after taking a ride on a tram in Melbourne          On the way to the beach Meghan smiled and showed Harry a little stuffed toy as the rode the tram in Melbourne          The couple took Melbourne\u0027s iconic tram system to the beach, catching it with student leaders at a local school          After lunch, the Duke and Duchess made a quick wardrobe change, the latter changing from heels to flats          Prince Harry also changed from the navy suit which originally matched his wife\u0027s outfit into a grey jacket and black trousers          The couple were also treated to lunch at Fitzroy\u0027s Charcoal Lane, which offers Aboriginal youths employment          Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of eucalyptus, the chef encouraged the royal visitors to smell it. \u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.          Among other plants, Harry bites into some eucalyptus, but not before he had to ask: \u0027Isn\u0027t that what koalas eat?\u0027          Executive Chef Greg Hampton (right) told the royal couple how they provide opportunity to young Aboriginal people          Harry tried plants and was also served Kangaroo and barracuda as a series of Aussie delicacies were prepared          Prince Harry has cheekily mocked a young girl (pictured) who put a hand on her hips and refused to take a photograph with the royalPrince Harry has cheekily mocked a camera-shy young girl who refused to pose for a photograph with the visiting royal.While thousands of fans have clamoured for a piece of the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle, this toddler in Dubbo had other ideas.She placed her left hand on her hip and stubbornly refused to move forward and say hello to a bemused prince.He in turn placed his hands on his hips to playfully mimic the young girl before bending down to give her a hug.The girl\u0027s parents were heard in the background giggling at their daughter\u0027s behaviour during the meet-and-greet in Dubbo on Wednesday before pushing her slightly forward to chat to the prince.                                                     But Meghan and Harry appeared completely at ease as they took a tram to the beach with a group of excited schoolchildren.While the journey lasted less than five minutes, the youngsters managed to get in some pressing questions.Charlie Wolf, a 12-year-old student from Middle Park primary school asked if the couple had any names for their baby.The children said Meghan replied with: \u0027We\u0027ve been given a long list of names from everyone, we\u0027re going to sit down and have a look at them.\u0027Ella Burns, a 12-year-old pupil from Albert Park primary school added: \u0027She said that she hadn\u0027t thought of one as it was still quite early.\u0027Meghan was also asked by Ella what she liked doing in her spare time.The Duchess replied that she \u0027didn\u0027t have much spare time\u0027 but when she does, she enjoys \u0027relaxing and watching TV shows.\u0027She faltered when asked what her favourite show was, and replied: \u0027There\u0027s heaps, I can\u0027t think of a specific one.\u0027 Meanwhile Lola Marinis, 12, from Middlepark Primary School, sat near Harry.He asked what job she wanted to do, and she replied that she wanted to be a teacher.Harry told her, \u0027There is always going to be one bad teacher that you remember, we need more good teachers.\u0027The Duchess of Sussex has been given plenty of flowers since she arrived in Australia. But today she was given her first tiara.It was presented by six year old Annie, a pupil at Albert Park primary school in Melbourne.Annie was one of 600 cheering children who greeted the duke and duchess as they came to see how the school is cutting waste and growing vegetables as part of a sustainability programme.Harry spotted Annie, who was holding a bunch of flowers as well as a toy tiara, and knelt down and said: \u0027Lily of the valley - is that right?\u0027Then, gesturing to Meghan, he said: \u0027Are they for her?\u0027The duchess, who was wearing a dress by Club Monaco, came over and said: \u0027Oh my goodness, thank you. Those are amazing!\u0027The couple met the school\u0027s \u0027waste warriors\u0027, dressed up in cape and masks, and met some sustainability leaders who showed them their \u0027nude food\u0027 lunch boxes, without any plastic wrapping.At the school wormery the duke was invited to name their pet snail. \u0027Speedy?\u0027 he suggested.At the vegetable patch, which included marigolds, peas, lettuce and alfalfa, Emma Cafferkey and Finn McClenaghan, both 12, showed them how to mulch. \u0027The mulch is made out of sugar that has been shredded. You have to remember with the mulch not to put it on top of the plants.\u0027After they left he said: \u0027They said we were very well educated and that we knew a lot about this kind of stuff.\u0027As they left, one little boy told Harry: \u0027You remind me of my uncle.\u0027The duke replied: \u0027Is that a good thing? Is it because I\u0027ve got a ginger beard?\u0027           The the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are a tactile couple and were often seen holding hands or giving eachothr a supportive rub this time at the Royal Botanic Gardens  Harry and Meghan as they visit projects that align with their goals on the tour including encouraging women to take part in sport          The Duchess concentrated as she passes an Australian Rules football during an event at Government House          Meghan has said she is \u0027tired\u0027 but having a fantastic time on their 16-day tour with 76 different functions in four different countriesFoodie Meghan was in her element as she and Harry enjoyed a taste of Australia at Charcoal Lane, a social enterprise restaurant in Melbourne\u0027s trendy Fitzroy suburb.At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi.It was prepared by young chefs being trained by the Mission Australia programme, which assists young indigenous Australians into employment, in many cases giving them a fresh start in life.Before the meal, they visited the kitchen, where Executive Chef Greg Hampton told the Duke and Duchess: \u0027Welcome, we are so happy to have you here.\u0027Gesturing at the sparkling surfaces, Harry said: \u0027You\u0027ve got a very clean kitchen – is it always this clean? Especially clean today?\u0027Meghan slipped off her Martin Grant trench coat in the warm room before Greg talked the couple through an array of unusual herbs and aromatic spices, getting them to smell and taste them.\u0027A lot of these ingredients have been here for thousands of years. Our fruits are the same as fruits thousands of years ago,\u0027 he explained.Showing them a finger lime, he squeezed out the fleshy contents, explaining: \u0027It comes out like caviar.\u0027\u0027Oh my goodness, that\u0027s incredible,\u0027 said the Duchess.But he warned the couple that the Tasmanian Pepper came with a kick, adding: \u0027I don\u0027t want to freak you out!\u0027Speaking ahead of their arrival, he had said: \u0027I would hesitate to offer her (the pregnant Duchess) the pepper, because they are quite hot.\u0027The first time I tasted one I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the heat creeps up on you. I don\u0027t want to freak her out.\u0027Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of Eucalyptus, he encouraged the royal visitors to smell it.\u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.\u0027Yes, but we can\u0027t eat it in the same way,\u0027 replied Greg, explaining how oils from the plant are used to flavour marinades, fish dishes and even ice cream.The couple were presented with Charcoal Lane aprons for the \u0027touch, taste and smell\u0027 experience, but did not wear them.Speaking ahead of the royal visit, Greg said: \u0027We are here to support young Aboriginal people into the workforce, with a view that when they leave this place, there is going to be long-term employment for them,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m not going to turn everyone that comes here into a chef, but if they leave here with a work ethic, it\u0027s a win for us.\u0027           The crowd of about 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm for the pair, despite being slightly behind schedule          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrived          Harry and Meghan went Government House, where they were greeted by Governor Linda Dessau          At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex raced model Formula 1 cars inside Government House, meeting with young leaders          Duchess Meghan was seen patting a guide dog in the reception of Government HouseCharcoal Lane currently employs 23 young people for 15 hours a week as they work towards a Certificate 2 in hospitality.\u0027A lot of them come from backgrounds where nobody has worked, so this is very important for them,\u0027 said Greg.Programme Manager Troy Crellin said that in 10 years, the organisation had helped some 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders into work.The Duke and Duchess\u0027s visit to the restaurant began after they admired a mural outside created by Gunnai and Waradgerie man Robert Young to honour the building and the area\u0027s indigenous heritage.He told Harry and Meghan how his Celebration Dreaming artwork references Aboriginal identity, connections and culture in inner Melbourne Fitzroy.Before heading into the kitchen, they received a Welcome to Country delivered by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Colin Hunter.Mission Australia CEO, James Toomey said: \u0027It was such a fantastic and humbling surprise to hear that Mission Australia\u0027s restaurant, Charcoal Lane was chosen to welcome The Duke and Duchess for a tour, hands-on cooking session and lunch. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the students to meet Their Royal Highnesses. Not too many young people can say they\u0027ve met and served royalty\u0027.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were introduced to some of Melrbourne\u0027s brightest and most innovative young people at a reception hosted by the Governor of Victoria, their first event of the day.The couple arrived at Government House for a Young Victorians Leaders reception approximately 25 minutes late after being stuck in traffic earlier that morning. But Harry and Meghan got straight to work when they were greeted by the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, and her husband Anthony QC, who took them inside for a private meeting.Ten minutes later the couple re-emerged and were escorted across Government House\u0027s West where they were able to see a display put on by Victoria\u0027s This Girl Can empowerment campaign, which encourages everyday women to get active however, wherever and whenever they want without being judged.The couple were presented with a display of 150 women showcasing a number of activities, including netball, yoga, boxercise, cricket, cycling and Zumba.Meghan appeared to enjoy the fitness display, which was accompanied by high-energy soundtrack by DJ Yo Mafia, and was even convinced to throw an Australian Football League gameball. \u0027I\u0027m not sure I will be good,\u0027 she nervously laughed as she delicately threw the ball to one of the women. \u0027I\u0027m not sure I did it right!\u0027Jerril Rechter, CEO of VicHealth who showed the duchess around the event, said: \u0027She was really impressed by the ersity of activity we had here today, and especially the sense of camaraderie between the women.\u0027She did pass an AFL football. She did a handball. That\u0027s a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do.\u0027She had not seen an AFL football before Howard, the governor\u0027s husband, explained to her what it was like - the weight of it is a little bit different, and that you handball it, you don\u0027t pass it.\u0027Sabrin Nyawela, 20, a student teacher and This Girl Can ambassador originally from South Sudan, also spoke to the duchess.\u0027She was talking about how she loved the whole vibe of This Girl Can. She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged. She has done a lot of work in the background with women\u0027s empowerment and it was good to see her coming along and seeing people in local communities making a change.\u0027After walking around the presentation, the couple — who had spit up to view different areas of the display — reunited to walk inside Government House to meet young people involved in a number of innovative and entrepreneurial programmes developed by young people in the Victoria region.First up was the Man Cave — a preventative mental health program for teenage boys, which was founded by Queens Young Leader Hunter Johnson. \u0027There\u0027s a familiar face,\u0027 Meghan said as she reached out to shake the CEO\u0027s hand. Harry also made a beeline to greet Johnson, who quickly thanked the Duke for his support.The conversation quickly turned to Harry\u0027s speech in Dubbo on Wednesday, where he delivered an emotional message to Australian farmers and opened up about depression and mental health issues. \u0027So many young much are suffering from these problems without even realising,\u0027 Harry remarked.           Harry and Meghan started the day with an Aussie walkabout past fans outside Government House          Meghan called her new husband over to speak to some people in the throngs of fans who had been there since 4am          The couple were clearly having lots of fun walking the route to Government House as they were showered with gifts and good wishes          At one point the Duchess of Sussex looked completely wide-eyed as they were met with deafening screams from fans          Meghan says hi to a woman and shakes her hand as people waved Union flags and the Australian flag in tandem          The Duchess looked touched as she was handed a large cuddly toy and a bunch of roses by one young girl   Sporting the pasta necklace a young boy made for her, Meghan made her way through throngs of fans to Government House, with husband Harry carrying armfuls of flowers behind her          There were plenty of posters welcoming Meghan and Harry to Melbourne, including this one from a little boy

What she uncovered, involving ‘serial’ offences by some MPs, is shocking. In a damning indictment of life at Westminster, Dame Laura pulls no punches, describing ‘a culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence, in which bullying, harassment and sexual harassment have been able to thrive and have long been tolerated and concealed.’MPs manspread their thighs to hide the gaps: QUENTIN LETTS...Tory MP Craig Mackinlay\u0027s 2015 election win \u0027would have been...Share this articleWe owe it to all those brave people who came forward not to sweep this under the carpet. Which is why you would expect Labour — with its long and honourable history of fighting for gender equality and the protection of employees — to be in the vanguard of those calling for the resignation of the Speaker.He is the one who has presided over this abusive culture, and is even now trying to cling on to office by hinting that he will step down quietly ... next year.It must be added that Mr Bercow himself has been accused of bullying staff — an allegation he firmly denies.          Ms Hoey accuses Mr Bercow, pictured, of presiding over the abusive culture and has even faced accusations of bullying staff, which he strongly denies If these allegations in Dame Laura’s report — including the groping of female staff — were made about staff in a private company, my colleagues on the Labour benches, normally so keen on women’s rights, would be clamouring for the chief executive’s head ... before breakfast. This is the party that likes to call itself progressive, even though it has never had a female leader, while the Conservatives have had two women Prime Ministers.So did Labour demand immediate action when the Speaker granted an urgent question on this matter in the Commons on Tuesday? Well, no. While female Tory MPs angrily called for Mr Bercow to step down, some Labour MPs, including Dame Margaret Beckett — a member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life — and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry seemed anxious to ensure his survival.Emily Thornberry said later on Sky News: ‘I think this is absolutely not the time to be changing Speaker.’The reason for such pusillanimity from Labour’s ranks of feminists became plain when Margaret Beckett admitted: ‘If it comes to it ... the most difficult decision we’ve made for hundreds of years trumps bad behaviour.’ She was of course referring to Brexit — which is the real reason the Speaker was let off the hook.          Ms Hoey criticised her fellow Labour MP Emily Thornberry, pictured, who believes Mr Bercow should remain in post until after Brexit For he is the pro-Remain controller of parliamentary business, and that means they are willing to ignore the blindingly obvious — that this discredited occupant of one of the highest offices in the land must go. And go now.The Speaker is meant to be a neutral figure, conducting business free of party political taint. As William Lenthall, a holder of that office, explained to Charles I: ‘May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me.’But Mr Bercow’s pedigree as a Remainer is undisputed — witness the sticker affixed to a car occupying his personal parking space earlier this year proclaiming ‘B*****KS TO BREXIT’. Indeed, he made no secret of his Remain sympathies while speaking to students back in 2017.He is, of course, entitled to his personal views, but as Speaker not only should he be impartial, he must be seen to be impartial. Betty Boothroyd, in my view a great Speaker, would never have allowed herself to get caught up in this kind of controversy. She put Parliamentary dignity before her own ego.We are now entering the closing scenes of the protracted and tortuous drama that is the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. After years of behind-closed-doors negotiations in Brussels and in Cabinet, Parliament is about to take centre stage.The role of Speaker will be central in this closing act, and his or her decisions matter. But the idea that Mr Bercow is uniquely qualified for this role through experience is ridiculous: all the Deputy Speakers are perfectly capable of taking over.          She also criticised Dame Margaret Beckett for her failure to call for Mr Bercow\u0027s resignationWith the publication of Dame Laura’s report on harassment and abuse in Parliament, we are beginning the cleansing of the Augean stables. The document makes sometimes painful reading: several offenders were named repeatedly by those who gave evidence (though not named in the report), and several departments kept cropping up, too. Witnesses spoke of a ‘macho culture’ in which women were not welcome. Female members of staff would be told to make the tea, or asked if they needed to work or had a husband. Shockingly, there were allegations of racial abuse, also.The human cost of this is all too clear. ‘People who believed themselves to be strong, capable iniduals suddenly found that they were unable to eat or sleep properly, or they were shouting at their children or partners, or were prone to sudden bouts of crying or panic attacks,’ writes Dame Laura.One of the 200 people interviewed privately by Dame Laura spoke movingly of her feelings, and neatly sums up what is at stake. ‘We are proud to work in the House of Commons, but when we are abused those who lead us should support us, not abandon us to our fate and cover up the traces. And those who abuse us should be held accountable.‘Establishing a new complaints and grievance process won’t come close to solving the problems in this place. We need a seismic shift. But the institution is worth fighting for.’I take no pleasure in supporting the call for the Speaker to step down. He has made some useful changes which have helped hold the Executive to account, but he himself must be held to account and, as the report makes clear, without real change at the top there is doubt that anything will change down the line. The right of people going about their daily work to be treated with dignity, free of abuse at the hands of the powerful, be it sexual or otherwise, cannot be ‘trumped’, in the words of Margaret Beckett, by any political consideration — even one as momentous as Brexit.‘It may be that some iniduals will want to think very carefully about whether they are the right people to press the reset button and to do what is required to deliver that change in the best interests of the House,’ says Dame Laura.No name is mentioned, but you don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to work out the identity of one of those she is talking about.Some years ago, I played a small part in the downfall of the previous Speaker, Michael Martin. This was during the MPs’ expenses row, when he sought to cover up the details. He was sensible enough to listen to voices of concern and was able to leave while still retaining some dignity. Speaker Bercow should do the same.But as long as the Remainers in Labour — including those women MPs who are normally obsessed with equality — turn a blind eye in the name of political expediency, then he will stay right where he is in the crucial months ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"Director Michael Moore meets Pope Francis outside Vatican","story":"Michael Moore was pictured on the steps of St Peter\u0027s shaking hands and exchanging words with the pontiff          The film director waited among some of the Church\u0027s most senior cardinals to be granted an audience with Pope Francis on WednesdayMoore was raised a Catholic, but is no longer a practicing member of the Church according to an interview he carried out with a magazine back in 2012.He has also previously stated that he disagrees with the Church on issues of abortion and same-sex marriage, but believes there is a God.   In a seemingly sarcastic tweet in October 2016 Moore posted: \u0027Pope Francis has asked the United States, North Korea, Iran and Saudi Arabia to take one year off from killing people via execution.\u0027 But prior to that, Moore had expressed confidence that Pope Francis would be a breath of fresh air for the Church after he was announced in 2013. \u0027Say Our Prayers Tonight That This Pope Is Going to Be a Different Pope\u0027 he said at the time. Moore is currently in Rome to promote his recently released documentary \u0027Fahrenheit 119.\u0027             Moore could be seen taking photos on his phone as the Pope arrived to give his weekly address          He was pictured next to the youngest child of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr., Bernice Albertine King (right) as they met Pope FrancisPope Francis defrocks two bishops caught in Chile\u0027s widening...Pope Francis says having an abortion is like \u0027hiring a...Pope Francis blames the DEVIL for Catholic Church\u0027s sexual...Share this articleThe film is a dissection of the  2016 Presidential election and the subsequent Trump presidency and has grossed $6 million since its release last month.Outspoken Trump-critic Moore has admitted that the film is unashamedly partisan and defended comparisons between the President and Hitler. \u0027People said to me you\u0027re comparing Trump to Hitler,\u0027 says the 64-year-old filmmaker, author, comedian and activist, in London for the documentary\u0027s UK premiere.\u0027I said, no, that is a scene where Hitler is speaking like Trump.

She did a handball. That\u0027s a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do.\u0027She had not seen an AFL football before Howard, the governor\u0027s husband, explained to her what it was like - the weight of it is a little bit different, and that you handball it, you don\u0027t pass it.\u0027 Before trying Australian Rules Football, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were introduced to some of Melbourne\u0027s brightest and most innovative young people at a reception hosted by the Governor of Victoria.The couple arrived at Government House for a Young Victorians Leaders reception approximately 25 minutes late after being stuck in traffic earlier that morning. But Harry and Meghan got straight to work when they were greeted by the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, and her husband Anthony QC, who took them inside for a private meeting.Ten minutes later the couple re-emerged and were escorted across Government House\u0027s West where they were able to see a display put on by Victoria\u0027s This Girl Can empowerment campaign, which encourages everyday women to get active however, wherever and whenever they want without being judged.The couple were presented with a display of 150 women showcasing a number of activities, including netball, yoga, boxercise, cricket, cycling and Zumba.

She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged. She has done a lot of work in the background with women\u0027s empowerment and it was good to see her coming along and seeing people in local communities making a change.\u0027After walking around the presentation, the couple - who had spit up to view different areas of the display - reunited to walk inside Government House to meet young people involved in a number of innovative and entrepreneurial programmes developed by young people in the Victoria region.First up was the Man Cave - a preventative mental health program for teenage boys, which was founded by Queens Young Leader Hunter Johnson.\u0027There\u0027s a familiar face,\u0027 Meghan said as she reached out to shake the CEO\u0027s hand. Harry also made a beeline to greet Johnson, who quickly thanked the Duke for his support.The conversation quickly turned to Harry\u0027s speech in Dubbo on Wednesday, where he delivered an emotional message to Australian farmers and opened up about depression and mental health issues.\u0027So many young much are suffering from these problems without even realising,\u0027 Harry remarked.Also representing Man Cave was 14-year-old Rupert Grant, a student from Melbourne Grammar School who had been involved with the programme through his school after experiencing a \u0027tough time\u0027 in school. After explaining how the programme had made an impact on life for him and his friends, Meghan remarked, \u0027You\u0027re quite the spokesman!\u0027          Prince Harry and Meghan started model Formula 1 cars at demonstration held at Government House in Melbourne          Harry and Meghan have now arrived at Government House, where they were greeted by Victorian Governor Linda Dessau\u0027We really need more global leaders like Harry,\u0027 Johnson later shared. \u0027There is a change happening among men now, a focus on healthy masculinity and having his support is a real badge of honour.\u0027I thanked Harry for his role modelling and leadership - and we spoke about his incredible words in Dubbo. When I said that the Duchess looked up him proudly.\u0027It\u0027s important that as men we address these issues, that we\u0027re not afraid to take the mask off and open up. To have started that conversation in Dubbo yesterday was powerful.\u0027He\u0027s a positive, glass half-full person and has an incredible influence on the younger generation. He is the right role model for young men and boys today.\u0027After meeting the team from Man Cave, the Duke and Duchess moved on to learn more about Aubot, a robot that can help hospitalised children continue to attend school and the disabled attend work.\u0027This is amazing,\u0027 Meghan commented as she waved a hand in front of one of the robots named after its founder and CEO Marita Chang.Harry seemed particularly interested in their next presentation - a vertical, edible \u0027farm\u0027 designed to grow inside Melbourne cafes, restaurants and, one day, people\u0027s homes. \u0027It will be interesting to see one day how this challenges the supermarkets if people are growing these in their homes,\u0027 Prince Harry said of Farmwall, which was co-founded by Melbourne-based Geert Hendrix.\u0027But I hope that these can be produced with farmers in mind too, so they can exist side by side.\u0027Added Meghan, \u0027I like that there is a focus on nutrients. I can see you have the sprouts, the micro greens... It\u0027s very clever.\u0027          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrive          Recently announced pregnant, Meghan removed her coat as the couple approached the steps of Government HouseThe couple\u0027s final presentation was by the team of Trinity Grammar School, who were part of the Formula 1 in Schools programme - an international STEM competition for schools in which students design and manufacture a miniature car out of an official F1 Model Block.Upon seeing the miniature F1 drag strip the students had built on the State Dining Room table, Harry joked, \u0027We should put one in Buckingham Palace.\u0027They were then offered to launch the two F1 race car models, however neither were expecting the loud air release from the hydraulics that launched the cars. \u0027I wasn\u0027t expecting that!\u0027 exclaimed Meghan, who jumped at the loud noise. Harry laughed.Following the innovation program displays, the Duke and Duchess were escorted by the Governor and her husband to the main reception in the Government House Ballroom, where approximately 350 young people representing the future of Victoria were gathered. The guests were from a broad range of backgrounds, including students, military personnel, entrepreneurs, charity volunteers and farmers.\u0027You are the future of our state - brilliant, innovative and inspiring,\u0027 Governor Dessau said in a welcome speech before the royal couple split up to socialise with the guests who had been grouped together.One of the first Meghan got to meet was Willow the golden Labrador, who was representing Guide Dogs Victoria. \u0027Ahh, everyone knows my achilles heel is dogs,\u0027 she cooed, before kneeling down to pet the \u0027ambassadog\u0027.

The Duchess is a big role model to many.\u0027Harry, who had been working the opposite side of the room - meeting military personnel and volunteers at the Victoria Police force amongst many others - rejoined his wife to move to the final part of their visit in a formal reception space at Government House.

Eating should be a sensuous experience, and sometimes you have to rush your meal, which is sacrilege in a way. If you’re able to, take time to enjoy it.What music do you play when you’re entertaining? Baroque has a nice steady beat, and sits nicely in the background. Vivaldi’s Four Seasons is an obvious one, but people can hum along while eating.What three songs would you always put on a dinner party playlist?JS Bach’s Goldberg Variations for the starter Vivaldi’s Four Seasons by Rachel Podger as a main then Gavotte Pavlova for dessert, served with pavlova!You’re cooking Beautifully Simple cod and prawns with fennel and white wine on the Classic FM podcast (see recipe below) – is it a combo you enjoy?Absolutely, my wife and I love fish, and I adore the aniseed taste of fennel – it goes so well together. A winning combination.What do the ingredients make you think of?Cod takes me back to my university days in Dundee. We’d go to a hot dog stand and have fish and chips with mushy peas. Now the batter is a lot better than it used to be!What kind of cook are you?I cannot cook. I’m not proud of this. I’m really good at boiling eggs though – I have a 1970s electric egg-boiling machine that my mum gave me. Every weekend I’m in charge of eggs!What’s your favourite dish?I absolutely adore duck in any form. Either confit de canard or magret de canard. Served with apple for a bit of sharpness, mashed potatoes and anything green.Are you an adventurous eater?I have one rule when it comes to what I won’t eat – it mustn’t be moving. As a reporter, you eat when you can, so I’m the absolute opposite of a fussy eater.What’s your go-to easy meal?My wife will slap a steak in a frying pan, grill it on one side, then the other. I like it with a bit of pinkness, no embellishments. Maybe a little bit of onion and garlic, nothing fancy.What piece of music reminds you of a particularly amazing meal?The last big story I covered was the 1986 revolution in the Philippines. The day after the president was elected, I got an exclusive interview with her – it was the high point of my career. That evening, I took my crew out to dinner in Manila and there was a string quartet playing Mozart’s Little Night Music. Whenever I hear it, I think of that interview.What music always makes food taste better?Music you enjoy. Andrew Lloyd Webber said there’s only good music and bad music, and I agree.What would be your desert island meal?Artichoke as a starter, followed by duck – I could find that on a desert island! Then lemon sorbet.Which restaurant plays the greatest music?I don’t like restaurants to play music. If you’re eating out, you’re with somebody you like and want to chat.If your favourite song was a meal, what would that be?Frank Sinatra’s I’ve Got You Under My Skin is my favourite song. I’m a trombonist and it has an amazing solo.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces had several admirers last week. Peter Law-Jones wrote:Coming to the end of A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, a surreal journey through a febrile mind and New Orleans. The sense of a truly absurd world is both unsettling and very funny. An excellent read.And the Thepuffpastryhangman said:I’m enjoying A Confederacy of Dunces for a second time. An utter joy. The descriptions of Ignatius’s ‘hobby’ make me snork every time. Second only to the magnificent Lucky Jim for laughs.On the subject of rereading, bobthekelpie has had an interesting experience with “an old favourite that I periodically reread”, The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown:What I did not realise until I started reading my daughter’s copy, is that the version I loved as a child, that I have faithfully reread all these years, was heavily abridged. OMG MIND BLOWN.So I’m now reading an old, but wonderfully new and better version of one of my favourite books.Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel is “an amazing, amusing, informative book” according to Dogbertd, who has to be quoted in full:I’m really glad I stumped up for the hardback because the pictures are (naturally) an integral and important part of the book, and you’ll want time to examine them closely. Hamel is an engaging and amusing guide to 12 of the most precious books written in Europe in the period before Gutenberg made print accessible to all.Hamel uses the same method throughout. First, a description of where the book is housed – along with sometimes caustic comments on his experience of getting his hands on the books – he hates those white gloves you’re sometimes forced to wear, but he loves the librarian in St Petersburg who gives him chocolates to eat as he’s perusing a 15th-century manuscript. Then he describes the book itself, pointing out the most interesting features: it’s like having the the best tour guide in the world at your side – in one book on the Apocalypse he notes that the Antichrist has had his face scratched out by an outraged reader – as has the Whore of Babylon (serves her right, he says). He then expounds on the history of the book and the sometimes murky routes it has taken to its current resting place.Along the way you’ll learn what a Psalter or Book of Hours is, why many manuscripts have pictures of cats playing viols (and it’s not because of the connection to catgut) and why the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury both bowed down before de Hamel.It’s a superb book if you love books and history, the Middle Ages, literature and art.Here’s a brave admission from NorthernSceptic:No doubt. Meanwhile, Grumpywoman56 recommends A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman by Margaret Drabble:It’s a collection of short stories and I’m really enjoying it. She eloquently expresses the hidden thoughts (even to themselves) of women. They were written in the 70s but it could apply to today’s society. It’s spurred me on to read more of her work.I needed something light-hearted and his equal parts interesting and amusing style is perfect. The only trouble is, I’ve read nearly 250 pages since Sunday night so I’ll need to find something else by the end of the week …How about Émile Zola’s The Beast Within? It has grabbed beingsentient:Tolstoy’s War and Peace has won over FrogC:I am reading War and Peace for the first time, at the age of 61. Only about 200 pages to go now. It is extraordinary, and there is no other novel like it. All the same, the essays on history, where Tolstoy forgets his characters for a few chapters and just rants about the errors of historians, are very strange, and one is inclined to think a novelist can’t do that. The only reason he gets away with it is that there is so much else going on at the same time.And tericheri adds of the same epic novel:That’s what I call a good read. The rest are mere trifles.All of them?!Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

A proud community, where an honest day’s work could earn you a decent day’s pay. Years of austerity have ripped the heart out of this place. But that’s just part of the story. This has been decades in the making. We lost the factories, we lost the jobs, we lost confidence in our community. We lost control.”So runs the introduction to a short film titled Our Town, shot in places such as Mansfield and Hastings (and, somewhat confusingly, the cities of Liverpool and Glasgow) and released three weeks ago by the Labour party. In terms of political strategy, it is a clear attempt to push Labour’s message into places where it has been underperforming, and address its supposed “towns problem” (more of which in a moment). Viewed from another perspective, its three and a half minutes are a brisk and very powerful tour through the three-decade failure of what some people call neoliberalism. More than anything, it vividly evokes one of modern Britain’s starkest cultural ides: the one that separates our bigger, most successful cities from hundreds of comparatively disadvantaged towns, and which exploded so spectacularly in the vote on whether or not Britain should leave the EU.This much we know: across the world, cities are growing at speed, powered by the tendency of modern economies to build themselves around clusters of educated people, and the so-called agglomeration effects whereby cutting-edge businesses are attracted to places where networking and collaboration happens as a matter of course. This leaves towns in a very uncertain position, and the resulting frustrations and resentments have obvious political manifestations: Trump v Clinton, leave v remain, and the sense that mainland Europe is now cleaved by a battle between metropolitan liberals and populists who draw their support from well beyond the city walls.Since 2010, as we have travelled around the country making films for the ’s Anywhere but Westminster series, towns and their sense of distance from power and influence have been a key subject we have returned to time and again. Indeed, we have often understood the watershed political stories of the past few years in terms of particular places. For us, the rise of Ukip was synonymous with Clacton in Essex. We watched the story of the Scottish independence referendum of 2014 unfold from the vantage point of Falkirk, population 35,000. Two years later, we came to associate the phenomenon of working-class support for Brexit with the post-industrial Welsh town of Merthyr Tydfil. Moreover, one of the other things highlighted by the Labour film has become more and more clear: such places are now at the centre of British political conversation.We both grew up in towns, and regularly talk about an unshakeable affinity with their rituals and everyday rhythms: market days, the massed Saturday rush to the supermarket, the daily sense of things beginning to slowly wind down at 4pm every day. And we’ve recently spent sufficiently long spells hanging around in ring-road pubs and high-street coffee outlets to come up with a series of conclusions about towns, where they are headed and what it all means for the future of the country. As follows:The night’s big story, however, was Labour’s national surge. Sent into a spin by the shock national exit poll, we drove 11 miles down the M6 to central Birmingham, where we found a completely different political reality. Most of the people we met were under 30, and they had voted Labour in their droves. Their opinions about immigration, Brexit and the future of the country were often the polar opposite of what we had heard in Walsall. It was an amazing thing to see, but in the flurry of coverage of Labour’s achievements, one thing was rather forgotten: the switch from Labour to the Tories in Walsall North had been replicated in such constituencies as the former mining town of Mansfield, Stoke-on-Trent South, North East Derbyshire, and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland – and, indeed, the 120-odd seats where there had been a swing from Labour to the Tories.Before Corbynmania, there was Milifandom. On a platform of higher taxes for big earners, tackling the energy giants, and talking in general about the shortcomings of 21st-century capitalism, Ed Miliband had apparently arrived at a strong position in the polls. Much of left-wing Britain and the liberal chatterati, informed largely by their social media bubbles and errors in polling, thought in 2015 that he would be prime minister. But when we pitched up in the highly marginal Midlands constituency of Nuneaton, in among a very familiar townscape that included a still-busy street market and apparently thriving retail parks, we found no evidence of what such excitement was ostensibly all about. Sure enough, the Tories retained Nuneaton with an increased majority – and in 2017, even though Labour’s support went up, the Conservatives also put on votes, and Nuneaton stayed blue.This is one example among many of a story that now sits at the heart of Britain’s political future – and as Nuneaton proves, it goes beyond ideas of “left behind” communities and places that have become byword for hardship. Whatever their economic position, there is something about towns – in England in particular – that often makes them difficult territory for the modern left, which sometimes looks in danger of piling on support in urban areas where left-liberal values are a given while it retreats from less populous places whose collective politics represent much more of a challenge. This is the crux of what has come to be known as Labour’s “towns problem”. Of the 64 seats the party now needs to win a parliamentary majority of one, 31 are essentially town constituencies among its top 100 targets, the figure is 49.Labour’s film is a powerful evocation of a long history of political and economic failure. But in its unendingly bleak picture – crystallised in the claim that “years of austerity have ripped the heart out of this place” – it is arguably guilty of one of the things that sits at the heart of too many portraits of towns: the idea that the most disadvantaged places are not only devoid of hope, but of people and organisations making a real difference to everyday life.Neither is true, as has been proved by pretty much every town we have spent time in over the last decade – and, indeed, our own mistakes. These are easy to make, because the most visually striking aspects of some places – the boarded-up shops, empty streets and uncollected rubbish – are what you tend to see first, and stories are easily told in terms of extremes. But places are always much more complicated than they might first appear – and besides, people are hardly going to react well to being told by outsiders that where they are living is hopeless.On one particularly memorable occasion, we made a video in Stoke-on-Trent – the city made up of the six towns of Stoke, Hanley, Burslem, Longton, Fenton and Tunstall – that overemphasised its bleaker aspects and attracted the anger and frustration of a lot of local people. So we went back there, and found enough of what academics call “social capital” to fill an eight-part series of videos: a thriving milieu of young entrepreneurs and artists and a DIY spirit among community groups working to improve their areas without help from outside. The Portland Inn project, for example, has used the Community Asset Transfer process to take over a closed-down pub at the heart of an estate and reopen it as a community centre. Then there is the community group Our Burslem, which revived festivals and is campaigning to bring a street market back to what locals call “the Mother Town” – in the face of the fact that Burslem is usually portrayed in the media as a ghost town.What this highlights is not just about the media and its blind spots. It also shines light on the political left’s ingrained habit of thinking that lasting change is best brought to places via the distant central state. In an age when people are networked together and towns and cities teem with grassroots initiatives, that model will no longer work.Eight long years ago, just as Ed Miliband became Labour leader, we spent time in Altrincham, an outwardly affluent market town on the southern edge of Greater Manchester. It had been laid low by the opening of the massive Trafford Centre retail destination and a huge new Tesco, and local people talked in emotional terms about the awful decline of the town centre, not just the number of empty shops, but the loss of something even more precious. “There is something missing in Altrincham,” one woman told us. “It’s a miserable place to come to. Most people I know are reasonably well off, but there isn’t the community we had 20 or 30 years ago.”The town has since been revived partly via an array of independent food shops and “artisan” businesses, a transformation that has been accompanied by remarkable political changes: it was once a rock-solid Tory heartland, but two of its borough councillors are now from the Green party. The moral of the story is pretty clear: once a town’s high street falls into decay, resentments and frustrations are sown that can eventually have serious political consequences.Everywhere we go, people talk about the fate of their town centres with amazing passion, and frustration. Obviously, the Altrincham model of regeneration will not suit everywhere, to say the least. Labour now has a five-point plan for high streets that takes in an end to ATM charges, free wifi, a new register of empty properties, free bus travel for under-25s and reform of business rates. It sounds promising, though perhaps evades something that is glaringly obvious: conventional chain-store retailing is dying fast and high streets need to find new uses. Until this sinks in, the mood of resentment and political disconnection that characterises many of our towns will fester on.With good reason, the political debate about austerity tends to focus on cuts to such crucial services as adult and children’s social care, education, libraries and public transport. But there is also an overlooked ambient austerity manifested in streets festooned with rubbish and the decline and decay of public space – and it has a huge effect on how people feel about where they live and what politics has to offer them.Last year we made one of our general election films in Lancashire. We followed a Labour council candidate called Lisa Bloor around her hometown of Haslingden, a former mill town with a population of 18,000. She has direct experience of cuts because of her father, who has Parkinson’s disease – but one of her most affecting illustrations of what austerity had done to where she lives came when she took us to a local park whose most obvious features were flaking paint, rusty swings and an inescapable sense of neglect. “These might seem like little things that don’t matter to a lot of people, nationally – but to communities like this, this park is everything,” she said.After eight years of cuts, many people we meet have fatalistically talked about austerity as being like the weather, but others have proved that the degradation of the public realm has already fed into the vote for Brexit and support for Corbyn’s new Labour party. In towns, austerity fuses with all those boarded-up shops to confirm people’s sense that they are still being ignored. This feels like an issue that is slowly turning critical, which is what lies behind the prime minister’s recent promise that austerity is over, and why she will be in hot water if – as seems likely – it actually carries on.In 2013 Margaret Thatcher died, and Anywhere but Westminster embarked on an Iron Lady-themed road trip. We started in one of the biggest towns in post-industrial south Wales: Merthyr Tydfil. Outside a huge Tesco Extra, two men in their 50s told us they still talked about the 1980s miners’ strike every day. On the high street, however, we stopped a 19-year-old woman about to start college and asked her if she knew what a trade union was. “No,” she replied. “What’s that?”This is one example of the radically different views of politics that sometimes feel like they cut towns in clean in half. Another is centred on some of the things that sit at the heart of the debate about Brexit, and the fact that even in supposedly hardcore leave-supporting towns, there are fascinating isions in how people think about the tangle of issues that came to a head around the 2016 referendum.Obviously, young people who are not happy in towns tend to leave. It is the older generations who stick around, and who feel the changes to town life more deeply. Despite the fashionable idea that Britain’s current malaise will be miraculously ended once they begin to die off, they are going to be around for some time to come.Rugeley is a one-time mining centre in Staffordshire that sits in the shadow of a disused power station. It is now the home of a jaw-droppingly huge Amazon fulfilment centre – so big that in a car travelling at 30 mph, it takes almost a minute to get from one end to the other.Just over a month ago, we went there to watch the GMB union trying to increase the takeup of union membership. The workers came in on foot, in shared cars, and in large buses from nearby towns such as Walsall and Wolverhampton. Most of them ignored the campaigners trying to hand them leaflets, and the atmosphere at the gates had an uneasy, brittle aspect. The distribution centre sits next to a Premier Inn and a branch of McDonald’s: thanks also to the endless roar of huge Amazon lorries, it is one of the most quintessentially modern places we have ever visited.People in places like Rugeley are often called “the left behind”. For sure, the industries that once dominated where they live have all gone. But many of these towns have been thrust to the cutting edge of a new economy of distribution centres, retail and hospitality, and logistics hubs, run using state-of-the-art technology. In that sense such towns point to where we are all going next, not least in terms of an automated future that most politicians have barely started to think about.The Somerset town of Frome is 14 miles from Bath and has a population of around 25,000, split between relatively recent incomers attracted to its newly fashionable reputation and people whose backgrounds reach back into the town’s industrial past and its recent experience of neglect and hardship.Frome has pioneered a new idea known as “flatpack democracy”, centred on the town and parish councils that form the English system of government’s lowest tier. We explored it two years ago.The idea has two key elements. First, it aims at running as many local amenities and services as possible from the absolute grassroots. Second, and equally important, it is about opening up decision-making to the maximum level of local participation. As the idea’s inventor, Frome councillor Peter Macfadyen, puts it: “There are other town councils where the clerk walks in first, and the members stand, the mayor comes in behind, and they then say a prayer. The public have to write in beforehand, saying they want to speak. And it’s all just lost in some sort of Victorian past. It’s just insane.”The idea of flatpack democracy, or something very like it, has been adopted in towns and villages in Bedfordshire, Devon and Cheshire. In the small northern city of Preston, an energetic Labour council is blazing a trail for something comparable but even more ambitious: the so-called Preston model of local government, whereby as much council spending as possible is aimed at boosting the local economy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have regularly wondered whether these ideas could be tried in the kind of towns whose experiences of deindustrialisation, political neglect and latter-day austerity have all highlighted the extent to which one their biggest issues is power, and the lack of it.Wherever we go, with good reason, most people we meet have no sense of which bit of government is responsible for this or that aspect of their lives – only that the forces making the decisions are remote, seemingly unaccountable and rarely interested in where they live. Many urban areas have been recently boosted by the creation of “city regions” governed by “metro mayors” in Scotland and Wales, devolution has brought power closer to people’s lives. In most English towns, by contrast, systems of power and accountability are pretty much as they were 40 years ago.What this does to people’s connection with politics is clear. To quote a report by the recently founded thinktank the Centre for Towns, “on average, people living in cities are much less likely to believe that politicians don’t care about their area. Those living in towns are, in contrast, more likely to think politicians don’t care about their area – and won’t in the future.”There lies the biggest issue of all. The future of our towns will only partly be decided by the high-octane rituals of Westminster debate, and general elections. What really matters is whether they might finally run a much greater share of their own affairs – and, to coin a memorable slogan, take back control.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc0af9824d32ebfa8c816cb2746028bbaed71ed/398_347_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cf1f249d28eb314d65615f4eb6139e0","title":"british compassion politics kindertransport cross party movement","story":"The empathy that brought me here on the kindertransport has been lost. But a new cross-party movement hopes to revive itEighty years ago, Britain gave me a lifeline. It was 1939 and the Nazis had invaded Czechoslovakia. I, like hundreds of other children, was bundled on to a train out of Prague with little more than some clothes and a packed lunch my mother had made to keep me from going hungry on the long trip to England. I didn’t understand why this was happening. Nor did I know, as I sat in my train carriage trundling through Europe, that I was not only on a journey to a new country – I was starting a whole new life.Britain offered me sanctuary and it became my home. Most importantly of all, though I didn’t understand that then, Britain gave me safety, which meant that I could make plans for my future and realise those plans.Now, when I look at the images of refugees drowning in the Mediterranean, I often think back to that little boy on a train crossing Europe. They too are fleeing death and destruction. They too want nothing more than safety. Like me, they are forced to look beyond their countries’ borders for help.However, 80 years after the UK helped me, Britain is now denying similar help to other refugee children. There are 3,400 unaccompanied refugee children in Greece. More arrive daily. So far the UK government has taken just 15.But I would be naive if I thought that it is only refugees who were suffering mistreatment. In different ways, British citizens too are victims of an insidious political narrative that blames and punishes the vulnerable, the disabled and the poor, victimises minorities and deliberately ides communities. The evidence is clear: queues at food banks, rising homelessness, bulging prisons and an increase in hate crimes. Refugees are the thin end of the wedge.Across Europe we are seeing a sinister development: the rise of the far right in countries such as Hungary, Italy and Germany, which wishes to exploit the issue of refugees for its own political ends. In this country, inequality is rising. We face a mental-health crisis. The environment is being destroyed. Trust in politicians is at an all-time low.For many years I have worked with inspiring iniduals to combat injustice. I have been proud of the achievements of the causes I support – from Safe Passage and Help Refugees to the Refugee Council and Liberty. But I have also realised that unless we change the values that underlie our politics, we cannot have a compassionate and just society.That is why this Saturday I will be speaking at the launch of Compassion in Politics, a new cross-party initiative that aims to put compassion, empathy, and cooperation at the heart of politics.Together we will overturn the oppressive narrative that says that all humans are just greedy and selfish and our political system and society must be built in that image. We will point to the founding of the NHS, the Kindertransport that gave me hope, and the many young volunteers who give up years of their lives for virtually no money helping in the refugee camps in France, Greece and elsewhere, as examples of British compassion. We will argue that a political system and political ideas that reflect and encourage our own innate ability to feel compassion would make for a happier, more equal, just and productive society. And we will propose that in future all new policies will need to be judged by the extent to which they are built on and promote compassionate values.The experiences of my childhood mean I can never claim to be from one place or another. But I think I have benefited greatly through my life by meeting others like me who feel they belong nowhere – or everywhere. Those powerful friendships are far more important to me than any arbitrary isions governments create between communities and nations.Ideas, values, and love do not stop at borders they are not the property of one class or race and they grow stronger, not weaker, in the face of hate. Compassion in Politics is about proving that to be the case and creating a platform from which a new political programme – one built on cooperation, compassion, and empathy – can emerge. I am excited about what this project can achieve.• Alf Dubs is a Labour party peer and former MP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49dea83d418c85bf260411c33dc59791e8016b79/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=476c73836e267409bb5b18ee09310ee2","title":"governments no longer trusted climate change citizens revolt","story":"Our politicians, under the influence of big business, have failed us. As they take the planet to the brink, it’s time for disruptive, nonviolent disobedienceIt is hard to believe today, but the prevailing ethos among the educated elite was once public service. As the historian Tony Judt documented in Ill Fares the Land, the foremost ambition among graduates in the 1950s and 60s was, through government or the liberal professions, to serve their country. Their approach might have been patrician and often blinkered, but their intentions were mostly public and civic, not private and pecuniary.As for the economic elite, as the consequences of their own greed and self-interest emerge, they seek, like the Roman oligarchs fleeing the collapse of the western empire, only to secure their survival against the indignant mob. An essay by the visionary author Douglas Rushkoff this summer, documenting his discussion with some of the world’s richest people, reveals that their most pressing concern is to find a refuge from climate breakdown, and economic and societal collapse. Should they move to New Zealand or Alaska? How will they pay their security guards once money is worthless? Could they upload their minds on to supercomputers? Survival Condo, the company turning former missile silos in Kansas into fortified bunkers, has so far sold every completed unit.Trust, the Edelman Corporation observes, “is now the deciding factor in whether a society can function”. Unfortunately, our mistrust is fully justified. Those who have destroyed belief in governments exploit its collapse, railing against a liberal elite (by which they mean people still engaged in public service) while working for the real and illiberal elite. As the political economist William Davies points out, “sovereignty” is used as a code for rejecting the very notion of governing as “a complex, modern, fact-based set of activities that requires technical expertise and permanent officials”.Nowhere is the gulf between public and private interests more obvious than in governments’ response to the climate crisis. On Monday, UK energy minister Claire Perry announced that she had asked her advisers to produce a roadmap to a zero-carbon economy. On the same day, fracking commenced at Preston New Road in Lancashire, enabled by the permission Perry sneaked through parliament on the last day before the summer recess.The minister has justified fracking on the grounds that it helps the country affect a “transition to a lower-carbon economy”. But fracked gas has net emissions similar to, or worse than, those released by burning coal. As we are already emerging from the coal era in the UK without any help from fracking, this is in reality a transition away from renewables and back into fossil fuels. The government has promoted the transition by effectively banning onshore wind farms, while overriding local decisions to impose fracking by central diktat. Now, to prevent people from taking back control, it intends to grant blanket planning permission for frackers to operate.None of it makes sense, until you remember the intimate relationship between the fossil fuel industry, the City (where Perry made her fortune) and the Tory party, oiled by the political donations flowing from both sectors into the party’s coffers. These people are not serving the nation. They are serving each other.In Germany, the government that claimed to be undergoing a great green energy transition instead pours public money into the coal industry, and deploys an army of police to evict protesters from an ancient forest to clear it for a lignite mine. On behalf of both polluting power companies and the car industry, it has sabotaged the EU’s attempt to improve its carbon emissions target. Before she was re-elected, I argued that Angela Merkel was the world’s leading eco-vandal. She might also be the world’s most effective spin doctor: she can mislead, cheat and destroy, and people still call her Mutti. Other governments shamelessly flaunt their service to private interests, as they evade censure by owning their corruption. A US government report on fuel efficiency published in July concedes, unusually, that global temperatures are likely to rise by 4C this century. It then uses this forecast to argue that there is no point in producing cleaner cars, because the disaster will happen anyway. Elsewhere, all talk of climate breakdown within government is censored. Any agency seeking to avert it is captured and redirected.In Australia, the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, has turned coal burning into a sacred doctrine. I would not be surprised if the only lump of coal he has ever handled is the one he flourished in the Australian parliament. But he dirties his hands every day on behalf of the industry. These men with black hearts and clean fingernails wear their loyalties with pride.If Jair Bolsonaro takes office in Brazil, their annihilistic actions will seem mild by comparison. He claims climate breakdown is a fable invented by a “globalist conspiracy”, and seeks to withdraw from the Paris agreement, abolish the environment ministry, put the congressional beef caucus (representing the murderous and destructive ranching industry) in charge of agriculture, open the Amazon Basin for clearance and dismantle almost all environmental and indigenous protections.With the exception of Costa Rica, no government has the policies required to prevent more than 2C of global warming, let alone 1.5C. Most, like the UK, Germany, the US and Australia, push us towards the brink on behalf of their friends. So what do we do, when our own representatives have abandoned public service for private service?On 31 October, I will speak at the launch of Extinction Rebellion in Parliament Square. This is a movement devoted to disruptive, nonviolent disobedience in protest against ecological collapse. The three heroes jailed for trying to stop fracking last month, whose outrageous sentences have just been overturned, are likely to be the first of hundreds. The intention is to turn this national rising into an international one.This preparedness for sacrifice, a long history of political and religious revolt suggests, is essential to motivate and mobilise people to join an existential struggle. It is among such people that you find the public and civic sense now lacking in government. That we have to take such drastic action to defend the common realm shows how badly we have been abandoned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0952d37ca4377cc82e21976ff2f93cb18b17e24/0_190_2462_1478/master/2462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566667ac2ce153f657186707b1c9443f","title":"mohammed bin salman brutality saudi jamal khashoggi","story":"In June, when the ban on Saudi women driving ended, it was portrayed around the world as part of a modernising, liberalising agenda by the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Yet the authorities ordered female activists not to speak out in its favour. Their blunt message was that what was being offered was the gift of King Salman and his crown prince son, and not a result of the campaign by female activists. In fact, the government had arrested 11 of these activists a month beforehand. Though four were released, the remaining seven had led a petition demanding that the female ship system – which treats adult women as legal minors – be abolished. They remain in detention without charge, but could face up to 25 years in jail.In this way, what happened was nothing to do with reform but more like business as usual. In many ways the crown prince has already been more despotic than previous rulers, so the murky events in Istanbul surrounding the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate should not be quite as shocking as they may have first appeared.In the summer of 2017, 30 Saudi clerics, writers and intellectuals were jailed for expressing their opposition to the policies of the Royal Palace driven by Bin Salman. It was then that, sensing his arrest was imminent, Khashoggi fled to Washington. An eminent journalist and editor for 30 years, he had been banned from publishing articles or appearing on TV in December 2016 after his criticism of US president-elect Donald Trump.In his opinion articles in the Washington Post, he lambasted Riyadh’s diplomatic and commercial blockade of Qatar, its forcing of Lebanon’s prime minister Saad Hariri to resign (later revoked), and the crackdown on dissent and the media. Before the ascension to the throne by Crown Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz in January 2015, the Saudi monarchy allowed space, however reluctantly, for non-establishment Wahhabi clerics, and silenced dissenters by intimidation, co-option through cash handouts, and in the case of foreign-based opponents, periodic kidnaps. With the swift ascendancy of the headstrong Bin Salman, this changed.He has grabbed all centres of power, not only in the government – defence, the National Guard, interior ministry and its intelligence agencies – but also in the form of Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil corporation, as well as in construction and broadcasting. Bin Salman achieved this under the guise of launching a seemingly popular anti-corruption campaign, sanctioned by his father, in November 2017 – detaining 326 businessmen and princes in the swanky Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. Royal court officials said the detainees had stolen assets from the government. It was thus that the kingdom’s topmost duo eliminated their rival powers, including descendants of former King Abdullah. His son, Prince Mutaib, was removed as commander of the powerful National Guard. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the richest Saudi, with a net worth of $17.4bn, was confined to the Ritz-Carlton for almost 12 weeks. Eventually, after reaching an undisclosed deal and telling a TV interviewer that “everything’s fine”, he was released. His vast mansion was placed under armed guard. Like all other freed detainees, he had to wear ankle bracelets so that his movements could be traced.In January, security services arrested 11 princes after their refusal to leave the historic Qasr al-Hokm palace in old Riyadh. They were held at al-Hair maximum-security prison. They had gathered there merely to frame an objection to a decree in which the government would stop paying the princes’ utility bills.The detained women’s rights activists have been smeared in the state-guided newspapers, which have accused their campaign of treason and implied it is funded by the much maligned Qatar.Thanks to their sympathisers, and international human rights organisations, the women’s rights activists remain in the public eye. In sharp contrast, the fate of the dissenting clerics, writers and intellectuals held without trial remains unknown. Equally unknown is the fate of the 56 Ritz-Carlton detainees who were brave enough to resist official coercion and threats, and were then transferred to traditional jails. These persecuted groups have become non-persons, the early victims of a totalitarian regime in the making under the 33-year-old Bin Salman.Yet history shows that the brutal suppression of dissent leads to a build-up of popular discontent to a boiling point, with disastrous consequences. King Salman is old enough to remember what happened to the shah of Iran. He should share his memory with his most favoured son.• Dilip Hiro is the author of Cold War in the Islamic World: Saudi Arabia, Iran and the Struggle for Supremacy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

This is certainly an important moment in a young person’s life, but in many cases it may be too late to shape their decision-making. Universities are looking to solve problems which can become entrenched far earlier in a child’s education.In 2016, a Ucas survey pointed out that children who know they want to enter higher education by age 10 or earlier are 2.6 times more likely to end up at a more competitive university than someone who decided in their late teens. This is why universities need to do more work in primary schools.Primary school children make an excellent audience. They are open, receptive and interested in external visitors (even if they can be a bit fidgety). For example: ask a question to a group of year six children, who are aged 10, and watch a forest of hands go up. Then ask the same question to a group of year nine children, aged 13. You’ll be lucky to receive any volunteers. If we want to raise aspirations of children we need to do it early, far in advance of the teenage years and before they are embroiled in the examination treadmill. By the time they reach their final years of school, pupils have generally already made up their mind about whether they want to go to university. While university visits may persuade prospective students of the institution they want to attend, the overall impact on widening access is negligible. A student gained by that institution is lost by another. Instead, we need to target children who believe university is not for them.The seed of doubt is often sewn earlier than people think. Educational disadvantage is often the result of a geographic lottery determining access to high-performing schools, which can begin to have a lasting impact on students during their time at secondary school. If we target children earlier, we can embed the idea that higher education is an achievable goal for all. To make real impact on a national level, a far earlier stance needs to be taken by all institutions.The reason why this hasn’t happened is because young children feel further away from the university decision-making process, and it’s harder to evaluate the effectiveness of outreach activities. But while they may not have an immediate effect on university admission stats, the long-term benefits could be huge. If children understand what higher education is and what opportunities are available from an early age, we can offset the anti-education mindset which sometimes takes root in the early teenage years.Programmes must be more than a series of one-off interventions, and should aim to help children understand what subjects are available and how they connect with subjects they learn about in the classroom. This might be through connecting research topics to the national curriculum, or bringing researchers and students into schools. Some universities, including my own, have entered into more formal partnerships with nearby primary schools through university-sponsored academy trusts.At a time when universities are being pressured to sponsor struggling schools, we need to carefully consider what we want these partnerships to achieve and where resources can be best spent. A recent Hepi report encouraged universities to engage with the pre-school system, devoting attention not only to primary and secondary schools but to nurseries as well.It is the responsibility of all universities to ensure children have an awareness and understanding of both the benefits and challenges of higher education from a young age. By doing so, universities will empower young people to make truly well-informed decisions throughout their education. The benefits of these activities may not be seen for many years, but if we leave it too late we run the risk of fuelling students’ worries about the future and their place in it, rather than opening their eyes to the possibilities.

The Manhattan district attorney’s office detailed the alleged misconduct in a letter to Weinstein’s lawyer that was made public. The new allegations against Det Nicholas DiGaudio involve an unidentified woman who says Weinstein raped her in his Manhattan hotel room in 2013. In the letter, assistant district attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said during the investigation, prosecutors asked the woman to hand in any mobile phones she might have used during the time when she interacted with Weinstein. The woman, she said, was willing to do so, but was worried the phones contained, “in addition to communications with the defendant, data of a personal nature that she regarded as private”. She asked DiGaudio what to do. He advised her to delete anything she didn’t want anyone else to see before handing over the phones, the prosecutors said. “We just won’t tell Joan,” DiGaudio allegedly said. Illuzzi-Orbon said the woman didn’t delete any information and instead asked a lawyer for advice. The phones were turned over “without any deletions”, Illuzzi-Orbon said. The lawyer hired by the woman contacted the district attorney’s office about DiGaudio’s conduct on 10 October. Weinstein’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman said the latest allegation against DiGaudio “even further undermines the integrity of this already deeply flawed indictment of Mr Weinstein”. DiGaudio was removed from the Weinstein case last week after evidence surfaced that he urged a witness to keep quiet when she raised doubts about whether a different accuser’s alleged sexual encounter with Weinstein was consensual.

Heurtebise is in love with Eurydice but Death herself in is love with Orphée, and the feeling is not merely reciprocated, but may in fact be his real motive in undertaking this existentially perilous journey to defeat mortality. It is a kind of sexual conquest, but Death must make a tragic or heroic act of self-denial in order to protect Orphée’s immortality as a poet.There is something weirdly brilliant in the low-tech special effects: the back-projections, the film run in reverse, the mirror-surfaces which become rippling vertical pools: “Mirrors are the doors through which Death comes look long enough in a mirror and you will see Death at work.” This film wonders what might happen if Orpheus did in fact manage to get his loved one home, but that the not-looking rule was still in force. The outcome is pure drawing room comedy and absurdity, yet there is a flash of pure terror when he finally sees her face in the car’s wing-mirror. And the poems of Cégeste, transmitted to this world, like the coded messages of the French resistance, have something deeply disquieting. It is a film to compare with Buñuel’s Belle De Jour and Welles’s version of The Trial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a0c53e4b58ea775897e7a8b0e077e96f8f016b5/1693_1980_4387_2632/master/4387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6560db5890ddf5bceaf034b5266ce66b","title":"how to cook the perfect piri piri chicken recipe","story":"Preparing the nation’s favourite dish at home begins with tracking down that all-important chilliA Portuguese dish with its roots in Angola and Mozambique, popularised in the UK by a Johannesburg-based restaurant chain, piri piri chicken may have a complicated past, but its present is crystal clear: we absolutely love it. That “cheeky” chain, Nando’s, has been described as “one of the most successful cults in Britain”, having carved itself an unlikely, but undeniable niche in our national identity. In perhaps the ultimate sign of its success, piri piri has now been added to the list of dubious attractions at my local Texan fried chicken shop, too. It seems we just can’t get enough spicy grilled poultry.Popularity, however, breeds contempt – and, even leaving aside questions of animal welfare, not all this piri piri has the vim and vinegar of the salty, sizzling stuff shoved through the hatch of your average Lisbon kiosk or churrascaria. Fortunately, however, if you can grill chicken, you can make much better piri piri chicken at home.The name piri piri comes from the variety of chilli used, a cultivar of Capsicum frutescens, which also includes tabasco chillies, probably taken by the Portuguese from their colonies in South America to those in Africa and, from there, to Europe. In Swahili, pili pili apparently means pepper-pepper – prompting the witticism “the chilli so hot they named it twice” – and it lives up to that reputation. The fruit registers 50,000-175,000 Scoville units (a measurement based on the amount of sugared water necessary to neutralise its fire), qualifying it for the “very hot” category in Kay Plunkett-Hogge’s book Heat, one below pure capsaicin (16m units, and “explosive!”).However, piri piri, while hot, aren’t particularly distinctively flavoured if the dried fruit I buy are anything to go by, so Plunkett-Hogge’s recommendation to substitute the similarly pungent (50,000-100,000 Scoville), easily available Thai bird’s eye chillies seems a good one. That said, given the heat is the important thing, so long as you stick with ripe red chillies, you can use just about any piquant variety you like.Add them to taste, as Seal suggests, bearing in mind that “the fieriness of the paste will be weakened by cooking, so go for slightly more heat than you think you like”.Seal’s recipe also includes red bell peppers, presumably as much for their colour as flavour, giving her piri piri a pleasing sweetness that goes down well with testers as a sauce, yet lacks the fire of some of the other versions. Again, that’s not necessarily a problem: according to Taste of Lisboa food tours: “We don’t even like spicy food that much. Yes, there is the possibility to order roasted chicken with spicy sauce, but most of the people don’t order the sauce and prefer to accompany chicken with fries.” In the UK, of course, we like both.Even more popular than the red pepper, however, is the brick-red paprika used by Tessa Kiros in her book Piri Piri Starfish, and by Stein and Phipps, whose choice of sweet and smoky is particularly useful if climatic conditions preclude barbecuing the meat. Those deploying a milder variety of fresh chilli might prefer to go for the hot sort instead: it’s up to you.This is a spicy, rather than a herby dish. My testers don’t think the oregano used by Henry, Phipps, Stein and Kiros adds that much once the heat is ramped up, and the same goes for Kiros’s bay leaf. Both would get lost in my fiery sauce, but may prove more welcome in milder versions.Similarly, the bold flavour of garlic is preferred to Phipps’s milder sauteed onion, but then, her sauce – based on the African Volcano range by South African chef Grant Hawthorne – is quite a different beast from the rest: a smoky, tomatoey, almost chutney-like affair that ends with a real kick. Hawthorne tells me that his recipe is based on one from Beira in Mozambique, and helpfully adds that west African versions use cumin and ginger, while ex-Portuguese colonies often include vinho verde as well as citrus for a sharper flavour. The testers absolutely love it as an accompaniment, but we all find its complex flavours get a bit lost in the cooking process, while simpler, sour and spicy marinades such as Mendes’s still shine as brightly as ever.Sharpness is one of the key qualities in most piri piri sauces, usually added in the form of lemon juice or wine vinegar – I prefer the cleaner flavour of the former, but either will do, and you may also like to add a little balancing sweetness, in the guise of sugar, as Henry, Phipps and Stein do, or port, as Kiros does. The latter feels pleasingly apt to me, but only if you have a bottle open: it doesn’t make enough difference to merit a special purchase – unless you’re looking for an excuse, of course.Mendes adds a whole lemon to his piri piri paste, which gives it a very distinctive, though not unpleasant, bitter zestiness that completely overpowers the chilli. Interesting, but not as universally popular as the crisps he suggests as an accompaniment.In Portugal, whole spatchcocked chickens are popular, but they tend to be smaller than can easily be found in the UK (Kiros calls for 800g birds the closest I can find is 1.2kg). As meatier breasts tend to dry out over a high heat, I’m going to go with Seal’s whole legs instead – although Stein’s large thighs are as delicious as you might have imagined in your most secret dreams, and the wings, which I don’t try, would be perfect for a party situation.Seal and Phipps marinate their chicken overnight in piri piri, Mendes leaves it for two hours, Kiros adds the sauce to the chicken for the last few minutes of cooking, and Stein doesn’t slosh it on until the meat is off the heat entirely. Stein’s method has the benefit of keeping the skin super-crisp, but it lacks the charred chilli flavour of the others. Kiros’s method feels like the best compromise – long enough for a spot of charring, short enough to keep the flavours fresh.Like Stein, she marinates the meat in lemon juice, garlic and salt first, as would be traditional in a Portuguese churrascaria, I believe. This gives it an addictive flavour without any risk of burning on the grill, a few flecks of garlic aside. However, Harold McGee has written that there’s no point in leaving it in this acidic bath for more than two hours, telling the LA Times that: “Any longer than that, and the meat will have a kind of mealy stuff on the surface. The structured meat tissue becomes tiny protein particles – fine for a paté, but not what you want in a steak” – or, indeed, grilled chicken.Mendes and Kiros both use large amounts of butter in their sauce, giving the finished dish a richness, but also tempering the heat. This prompts me to use olive oil instead, though you may prefer to go down their route. Some recipes also include whisky or brandy for preservation purposes, but unless you’re planning on keeping the sauce for a while, it doesn’t add much to the flavour.The barbecue is ideal for this purpose, but you can also get excellent results in the oven, as Stein recommends. I prefer to finish them off in a hot griddle pan rather than under the grill, which I find fiddly and more work to clean up.Serve with chips and lemon wedges if you want to go Portuguese, though it’s also very nice indeed with rice to soak up the extra sauce. Or, in Mendes’s style, freshly fried potato crisps – I have it on reliable authority that a bag from the supermarket also does the trick.4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick), skin on, bone inFor the marinadeJuice of ½ lemon4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tsp flaky saltFor the piri piri sauce2-4 red African or Thai bird’s eye chillies, to taste2 plump garlic cloves, peeledJuice of 1 lemon1½ tsp flaky salt2 tsp sweet smoked paprika50ml olive oil1 tbsp port or 1 tsp brown sugar (optional)Whisk together the lemon juice and garlic for the marinade. Put the chicken in a roasting tin just big enough to hold it, and pour the garlicky juice all over it, turning to ensure it’s well coated. Sprinkle with the salt, cover and leave at room temperature (unless it’s a very hot day) for an hour.Meanwhile, roughly chop two chillies (gloves are advisable) and the garlic, add the lemon juice and salt, and whizz to a puree (or mash well in a mortar). Whisk in the paprika and oil. Taste, adding more chilli if you think it needs it, and the port or sugar if you’d prefer it a bit sweeter.Prepare the barbecue, if using. Once it’s at cooking temperature, grill the chicken for 35 minutes with the lid on, then check. If it’s almost done, then brush with piri piri and cook, lid off, for about another 10 minutes, until cooked through.Alternatively, heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6 and roast the chicken for about 35 minutes, until cooked through, basting with its juices occasionally. Heat a griddle pan to medium hot, brush the chicken with piri piri, and grill for a few minutes on each side, until just starting to char.Either way, serve hot with the extra sauce on the side.• Piri piri chicken: do you prefer the Portuguese version or the African originals – and does Nando’s make a decent fist of it? If not, where else would you recommend? And piri piri prawns are delicious – but what else is delicious with this fiery sauce?

For Glasgow City, by contrast, this was a difficult night, reality hitting hard. Aspiration is one thing, attainment another a club built in part upon a Barcelona model, studied at close quarters here by City’s former manager Eddie Wolecki Black, were defeated 5-0 at the Mini Estadi, undone piece by piece.“We can hurt them,” Scott Booth had said. Instead it was Glasgow who hurt, the tie surely over already – yet recriminations may be relatively few so significant, so unavoidable was the difference between these sides.The game’s first shot actually came for Glasgow, Abbi Grant slicing past the near post after two minutes but by half-time there had been only two more – and one of those, blocked, did not even make it into the area. Two more in a single second-half minute, with the score already at 4-0, were the sum of their attempts and neither drew a save from Sandra Paños. Barcelona, by contrast, had 27 of them. That reflected the fact that victory was always likely, if not necessarily quite like this.A first-leg defeat in Kazakhstan in the previous round had come as a warning but Barcelona knew they were favourites – and Glasgow knew it too. These teams are at markedly different stages of their respective seasons Glasgow had been defeated by Hibernian in the cup and face a battle against the same team this weekend to retain a domestic title that has been theirs alone for a decade, the culmination of a long season the Catalans have only just begun and had scored 21 times in the last four games, nine in their last game alone. Paños was a spectator as they added five more here.At the other end Lee Alexander twice had to be alert in the first half. She would later be to blame for a goal in the second half but that was the fourth, the game already long gone. When the opener had come, she could do little more than watch it float over her head and for much of the remaining 80 minutes she saw Barcelona from worryingly close range, her defence virtually treading on her toes, retreating further with every minute, forced ever deeper.The scoring began when Mariona Caldentey escaped down the right. Her cross bent beyond the leap of Andressa Alves but found its way through to Kheira Hamraoui, arriving from midfield. She cut back, shifted her weight and chipped the ball up and over Alexander, a touch of curve and dip bringing it down well below the bar. A Champions League winner with Lyon, this was her first goal for a Barcelona side who seek to emulate that achievement. Only 11 minutes had gone but it was already their third attempt and it quickly felt like this game had escaped Glasgow.Barcelona took control, the ball theirs, the territory and opportunities too. Patri Guijarro hit the bar not long after and in the next move a pattern became evident that was soon unavoidable: as Barcelona pressed Glasgow had 10 players inside their own area, only Kirsty Howat not joining them and occupying a lonely island near the halfway line.And for all the players in there Barcelona still escaped them. The tall No 10 Alves attacked on the left again, rolled the ball under her studs and pulled it across the area. Arriving by the penalty spot Caldentey dummied it and Aitana Bonmatí slotted home the second unattended. Three minutes later they had a third. A perfectly weighted pass from Vicky Losada played in Caldentey and although Alexander moved swiftly to block the followup shot it bounced to Guijarro to score.The second half brought much of the same. Leila Ouahabi struck wide Caldentey headed past the post then Alves could not control Caldentey’s ball inside the six-yard box. A series of corners yielded little but still they came, still the ball circulated at Catalan feet.When it reached Alexander’s hands on 68 minutes it inexplicably slipped through, Alves’s shot from the edge of the area escaping her grasp and ending up in the net.Next María León’s shot skidded through and into the net. Natasa Andonova then thumped one off the bar, but there were no more. Five was enough fun for Barcelona for one night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90790bb00b0733a3dc555dacd74654eec2927691/665_628_5304_3183/master/5304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af68c0edc553f67c900a74f9a8d1f6a9","title":"crewe suspend academy coach fa inquiry carl everall safeguarding issue","story":"• Head of foundation Carl Everall’s behaviour investigated• Crewe back in spotlight after Gradi and Bennell casesCrewe Alexandra have suspended their head of foundation because of a safeguarding issue that has led to the club notifying the Football Association.Carl Everall, who has been coaching in the club’s academy since 2013, is also understood to have been suspended from all football-related activities by the FA while the governing body conducts inquiries into allegations relating to his behaviour. “This is a safeguarding and police matter so therefore the FA is not in a position to comment,” an FA spokesman said.Everall was previously an academy coach at Port Vale and left his position as joint manager at Whitchurch Alport, of the North West Counties League, to start working full-time for Crewe 14 months ago. He is well known within Crewe for his football work in the community and the charity game, the Everall Derby, he organises with his twin, Simon, a former Crewe trainee. His coaching qualifications include the FA advanced youth award and he is described as a popular figure at the club.However, the news of another possible investigation involving Crewe will be another blow to the club’s troubled reputation at a time when Dario Gradi, their director of football, has not returned to work since being suspended by the FA in December 2016.Crewe had initially hoped to keep the investigation relating to Everall as an in-house matter but when the  contacted the club on Wednesday the chairman, John Bowler, instigated high-level talks with his colleagues and a statement was released. “You will appreciate that it is not appropriate for us to comment in detail at this time,” it said. “I can, however, confirm that all relevant and appropriate procedures have been followed.”Gradi, who has been at Crewe since 1983, including 24 years and more than 1,200 games as manager, was ordered to stay away from football while the relevant authorities investigated his specific role in what the FA’s chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis he can remember in the sport.Gradi, who has an MBE for his services to football, employed Barry Bennell, the youth-team coach who was sent to prison for 30 years in February for raping and molesting boys in the junior systems of Crewe and Manchester City. Bennell, described as an “industrial-scale child molester”, is waiting to hear whether the Crown Prosecution Service is to press more charges relating to some of the other complainants. As of January, at least 97 people – though possibly more now – had reported Bennell to the police on the back of the interview Andy Woodward gave to the  in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club’s youth system.What was never made clear was whether Gradi’s suspension related to anything that had happened at Crewe, or if it went back to claims that in his coaching days at Chelsea he visited the house of a 15-year-old youth-team player to “smooth over” a complaint of sexual assault against Eddie Heath, the chief scout who has been identified as a repeat offender in the 1970s.Clive Sheldon, the QC who is undertaking the FA-commissioned independent inquiry into football’s sexual-abuse scandal, announced last month that it was being delayed indefinitely, largely because of the possibility that Bennell could face another criminal trial. Manchester City and Chelsea have been holding their own inquiries but Crewe’s decision that one was not necessary at Gresty Road, having initially promised a full investigation, has attracted widespread condemnation from Bennell’s victims and dismayed the relevant authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b618c3d0ca8752b1b6f6fbda6161ca1581566cf/0_138_2046_1228/master/2046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96f94e493617578a90ecd484b89f827d","title":"dj mim shaikh on finding his dad i wanted the disney ending so much","story":"The 1Xtra presenter didn’t remember his father, and everything he had heard about him was bad. So why was he so driven to track him down?Mim Shaikh is explaining why he went looking for his father. “My nan always said to me that when you turn 25, you become a real man,” the the BBC 1Xtra presenter says. “That’s when you know your own mind and can make proper choices.”Now 27, Shaikh does seem to have changed in the past two years. He is still as warm and good-humoured as he was when we last met, but he seems more serious. It was the death of his grandmother in 2016, he tells me, that “changed everything” for him.“I’ve always been curious about my dad,” he explains. “But never enough to go and find out, because I felt like it would be disloyal to my nan, who’d done so much for me.” After the breakup of her marriage, Shaikh’s mother was too unwell to look after him, so her widowed mother brought him up and took the decision to sever all contact with his father. “I was a single-parent kid, but my nan was my parent, not my mum,” is how he puts it.The long-lost father has become something of a trope in TV and film: from characters such as Darth Vader to countless father-reveal plotlines on EastEnders. Often the absent dad is a lovable rogue perhaps he was young and foolish back in the day and didn’t mean for things to turn out as they did. As an audience we are primed to root for an emotional reunion. But what happens when a fairytale ending comes with a darker twist?It’s a question that hangs over Shaikh’s new hour-long BBC documentary, Finding Dad, in which he goes in search of the father he has not seen since he was a baby – whom he has never even seen a picture of. It’s a journey that sees him crossing continents, discovering new relatives, but also uncovering old wounds.For years all Shaikh knew of his father was what he had been told by his mother’s family. That is that his mum met his dad when her family responded to an advert he had placed in a newspaper looking for a wife (both families had roots in Pakistan, and this was a not-uncommon occurrence in south Asian communities at the time). Shaikh’s parents met, married and settled in Dudley, near Birmingham.Shaikh’s father quickly became abusive, he was told, allegedly hitting his mother and locking her in their home. Shaikh’s mother, who was 19 years younger than his dad, had significant learning difficulties and mental health issues. Under the strain of her difficult marriage, we are told in the documentary, she deteriorated further. When Shaikh’s grandmother discovered what was happening, she immediately set about removing her daughter – and the then-infant Shaikh. All contact with Shaikh’s father was stopped. By then, however, Shaikh’s mother was unable to care for the boy, so his grandmother looked after them both.The three lived in south London, mainly in the Phipps Bridge housing estate in Mitcham. Money was tight, although the community rallied round, with neighbours and relatives helping to care for Shaikh and his mother. Shaikh struggled with feelings of anger and alienation, and what makes the documentary so engaging is his openness about how the situation affected him. This is also something he has addressed in his spoken-word work. In No Father’s Day, he recalls never having his mum or dad attend parents’ evening at school, only an aunt or uncle, and how it felt to have “classmates staring at your mum because she’s talking to herself”. Shaikh has described his relationship with his mother as closer to big brother and little sister: he has to look after her. Yet he says it has also encouraged him in his career, as he has risen from a baby-faced YouTube prankster serenading passersby to poet, presenter and actor – his most recent role being in the current BBC drama Informer.“I think if you’re born into a single-parent family, there’s a drive to be a success. If I’m unsuccessful, there’s no one left to look after my mum. So I feel have to become successful in order to provide and live a good life.” Yet there is also a darker legacy, he admits. In a poem he reads aloud in the documentary, he wonders if children from abusive parents are “bad seeds” and “destined to do the same deed”. So why, if the stories he heard about his father were so negative, did he still want to track him down?“I wanted the Disney ending so much,” he says. “I wanted him to put his arm around me and say, ‘Don’t worry, son, it’s all OK now. Don’t worry about all the birthdays that I missed – we’re together now.”Shaikh begins his journey with the documents he does have – the first few photos he has ever seen of his father, and a birth certificate stating his dad’s name. He follows these to Birmingham, to a mosque he believes his father frequented, and is introduced to three community elders. This meeting, like many of the others in the documentary, is painful to watch: Shaikh’s eager questions are met with awkward silences and subtext-laden answers. The interviewees appear to be using euphemisms to avoid hurting him – his father was “impatient”, they say, and “badly behaved”. But, finally Shaikh has his breakthrough: one of the men lived with his father and can confirm not only that he is alive, but can supply his address – in Pakistan.Which is where they eventually meet, after many calls in which Shaikh’s father puts the phone down on him. Persistence pays off, and as in all the best stories, father and son embrace and seem thrilled to find each other.But while the reunion is emotional, there is no neatly tied-up happy ending. When Shaikh begins asking questions about his parents’ marriage, his father denies everything, both the abuse and the abandonment (arguing the family conspired against him), while Shaikh gets a further surprise in the shape of his father’s two young sons. Suddenly he has brothers. “I’ve grown up my whole life as an only child,” he says. “And I found out later that it wasn’t just those two. From other relationships of my dad, there’s an influx of siblings. It’s a big thing to adjust your mind to.” Shaikh is still figuring out how much his father and siblings will be in his life. “Water isn’t thicker than blood, but sometimes it can be,” he says.Did he get the answers he craved? He wasn’t persuaded by his father’s version of events, he says, but still found some kind of resolution. And he was surprised by how much he felt at home in Pakistan. “My whole life I’ve been wrestling with identity issues,” he says. “Pakistan is in my blood – both my parents are from there. Before that I always thought I was more British than south Asian.”The experience also gave him a more profound understanding of his grandmother’s love. “There is no one that was stronger than her, mentally, in my family. Losing her was a big loss. But if she had never made those decisions, I wouldn’t be where I am. She – and my aunties in my family – they just make the men look weak.”It has also changed his perception of himself, and of the kind of man he wants to be. “It made me stronger. And it makes me want to be a good dad for when I have kids, even more. I can never turn around and do something like that to my child. I can never not speak to him in years and make him search for me. Never.”Finding Dad is on BBC Three via BBC iPlayer from today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/281bff68ea19456cb2a9375672c29589d70f562b/0_24_1724_1034/master/1724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83f717f612dca172544ba675d42aa802","title":"brextra time what the papers say about pms brexit cameo","story":"Theresa May has suggested she might extend the transition period – and several of the mastheads are not having itNews that Theresa May might be prepared to delay Britain’s departure from the EU until the end of 2021 has caused fury on the front pages of several newspapers today.The Daily Mail is scathing: “Another year in Brexit limbo?”, asks the paper’s shrill headline, reporting that the “PM ‘could make UK wait even longer’ to avoid no-deal cliff edge (but we’d have to keep paying EU billions)”.

The campaign is backed by MPs from across the House of Commons.Writing in the  to mark the launch, Lord Dubs said he was concerned that politics based on the values of kindness and fellow feeling was being edged out by less generous forces, exemplified by the rise of the far right in places such as Hungary and Italy.Dubs wrote that refugees crossing the Mediterranean did not have the same luck as he did in 1939, when he was given sanctuary in the UK. “But I would be naive if I thought that it is only refugees who were suffering mistreatment,” he wrote.“In different ways, British citizens too are victims of an insidious political narrative that blames and punishes the vulnerable, the disabled and the poor, victimises minorities and deliberately ides communities.”The campaign will seek to challenge “the oppressive narrative that says that all humans are just greedy and selfish and our political system and society must be built in that image”, Dubs wrote, pointing to policies such as the NHS.“The experiences of my childhood mean I can never claim to be from one place or another. But I think I have benefited greatly through my life by meeting others like me who feel they belong nowhere – or everywhere,” he said.“Those powerful friendships are far more important to me than any arbitrary isions governments create between communities and nations.”People who have signed up to the campaign include the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, Caroline Lucas of the Greens, and the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, Jo Swinson.Swinson said the country needed a change from “the toxic political debate that we see so often”.She added: “This movement could not have come at a better time. More than ever, we need politicians of all stripes to have constructive discussions and to work together, with compassion and respect, on the solutions we desperately need.”The campaign will launch with a conference on the issue in Oxford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e397a018a704646bf1f4239c8e670f27f052e1/0_0_1791_1075/master/1791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95e913b037bf89ed35b51e78274ad336","title":"fascists are like vampires let them in at your preil","story":"At first, inviting them on to chatshows and the pages of tabloids seemed like mischievous fun. But now they are glorying in the limelight – and hard to destroyFascism is interesting in its “creep” stage, where you have a hint of what you’re looking at, but you’re not quite sure, and you keep turning it over for historical marks, like the Antiques Roadshow of the Coming Apocalypse. But not in its “march” stage, when antisemitism and Islamophobia are in the open, misogyny is basking under the studio lights, and white nationalism takes its democratically mandated place in ancient parliaments. Intellectually speaking, that’s very boring the arguments are tedious, even if emotionally it’s as epic and engrossing as watching your house burn down.Don’t beat yourself up, this is timeless: Marie Curie would not win a debate with Steve Bannon about whether she should carry on doing science or go back to the kitchen Sigmund Freud would not win an argument against Nigel Farage over whether the psychoanalyst was exerting undue influence because HE WAS A JEW. Authoritarians delight in the weakness of their case if they can be that wrong, and still prevail, they get to prove how strong they are and besmirch the principles of truth and respect at the same time, so it’s win-win.What we used to do really well was rules. Fascists are like vampires – the important thing is not to invite them into your house, or on to your radio talkshow. Even if they have brought apple martinis or a really novel and interesting way of making a racist point, even if they’re wearing skinny jeans and have bleached their hair and it’s a real thrill to hear a person dressed like that opine that women should attire themselves more modestly, still don’t invite them into your house. First, it is not enjoyable to have them in your house, and second, if it gets to hand-to-hand combat with a vampire, they’re much better at it than you.In the sub-category of anti-vampire measures, the garlic-and-crucifix market, there are artefacts that decent people carry: a taboo against certain words, not because they are overtly racist or demeaning, but precisely because they are deliberately opaque and plausibly deniable. So a thoughtful person doesn’t say “swarm” or “flood” or “cheat” or “bogus” when talking about large groups of human beings, and avoid them because they are dehumanising. You can’t flirt with a little, light dehumanisation enough to keep the centre undisturbed and the alt-right hopeful. It’s either there or it isn’t more like garlic, in this respect, than a crucifix.It’s too late to get the vampires out of the house, though never stop trying to vote them out. A blast of daylight would probably do it: economies recovering from stagnation, bonds of civility and internationalism repairing themselves in the warmth of prosperity. It doesn’t seem likely, but no nights last for ever. In the meantime, we’re in late-season Buffy territory: everyone losing confidence, regular blasts of cold reality corroding the spirit, the group fragmenting, the enemy getting stronger, not because it’s better, but because to be unquenchably bloodthirsty and to have no soul is quite the combination, when you want to make stuff happen.So, it’s a bit too late to point this out, but might help for next time: we shouldn’t have let the fascists into the house not on to Newsnight to fight for white power, not into the tabloids to preach gunning down refugees, not on to chatshows and reality TV. It wasn’t mischievous and fun, it was stupid.I have about a thousand fights a week on Twitter, but the only time I’ve ever had a fight, with a stranger, in real life, over my actual opinions, was in 2014. It was about pubs – in a pub. MPs had just voted to untie pubs from pubcos, having noticed that large pub chains were locking landlords into punitively high beer prices, for “reduced” rents that weren’t that low, and the landlords then worked themselves to death for often less than the minimum wage (of course, they weren’t technically employed, so it was nobody’s fault). Scores of pubs were closing weekly. It was a classic story of our social fabric picked apart by cannibalistic capitalism, I wrote. “That was the most ill-informed, ill-written, ill-thought-through piece of journalism I have ever read in a British newspaper,” said the guy, all finger-jabbing and thick pinstripe. I assumed he worked for a pubco and moved away.But the argument over the great British pub has never subsided: they are still in decline, and their demise is still a classic carrier issue. Everyone can find an explanation, depending on what they think is wrong with the world. I still think it’s a story about late-capitalism. People who like to blame millennials for everything can, legitimately, say that it’s because the younger generation doesn’t drink enough (snowflakes, you know). Yesterday, one of my regular Twitter foes blamed immigrants: they come over here, they don’t have a drinking culture, the next thing you know, you’re knee-deep in coffee and the Dog and Duck has shut down.Unlike a regular carrier issue, however, there is scope for some personal agency here: if you really want to show your commitment to pub culture, all you have to do is visit more pubs, more often, and stay longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a977df56995b44e996c71e1fedf0b218dc537f9e/262_119_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac63297d213ad07f74ef554ae8fecfdb","title":"nathan hughes suspended for six weeks after what a joke tweet","story":"Nathan Hughes has been suspended for six weeks and is unavailable for three of England’s four autumn internationals next month after his “what a joke” tweet led to two extra weeks being put on to his suspension on Wednesday night.Hughes will miss England’s matches against South Africa, New Zealand and Japan after his suspension was confirmed following a Rugby Football Union hearing that lasted almost five hours. The Wasps No 8 was initially in the dock last Wednesday, charged with punching Gloucester’s Lewis Ludlow in the head, but an ill-timed tweet delayed proceedings until Wednesday night.It had been agreed by the initial disciplinary panel last week that Hughes would face a four-week ban – down from six for his guilty plea and mitigating circumstances – but when his tweet, which was written after he had been informed of his punishment, came to light, his hearing was postponed by seven days. He was summoned back into the hearing but it was decided it could not resume because his lawyer had left the venue.At Wednesday night’s hearing, Hughes was also charged with conduct “prejudicial to the interest of the game”, for which he pleaded guilty.\u0026nbspThe panel opted to deny Hughes the mitigation he had been granted last week because his initial plea of not guilty no longer stood. He was also handed a two-week ban for his tweet – to run concurrently alongside his six-week suspension – meaning he will be available for England’s last autumn fixture on 24 November against Australia.It brings an end to a sorry tale which has seen Hughes delete his Twitter account and the upshot is that Eddie Jones’s headache for the autumn internationals has only gotten worse.Jones’s options at No 8 for the November series were already diminished with long-term injuries to Billy Vunipola and Sam Simmonds and while he would have expected Hughes to be banned, it only rubbed salt into the wounds that a needless indiscretion on social media has cost him his availability for two Tests. Hughes also loses out on two match fees to the tune of £50,000.Chris Robshaw is also unavailable after undergoing knee surgery on Tuesday, meaning that Jones, who picks his 36-man squad on Thursday, may well have to field a back row against the Springboks on 3 November that boasts less than 10 caps between them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8423ef0eda6f5e4133c219917a46285254d6e1/1_0_4394_2638/master/4394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2732af3f95d5301d8ea3abe5f31e0a5e","title":"google pixel 3 review android performance camera design","story":"New phone reaches Apple-level of polish, with top-notch performance, fantastic camera and attractive designThe Pixel 3 is Google’s third stab at making its own top-end phone, attempting to outshine the likes of Apple and Samsung with a terrific camera and a highly polished experience.The Pixel 3 is the smaller of the two new Google phones, with a 5.5in FHD+ OLED screen that is bright, crisp and vibrant. It is a beautiful display that is a significant step up from last year’s Pixel 2, with wide viewing angles with minimal colour shift.The Pixel 3 mirrors the design of last year’s Pixel 2 XL with a relatively large chin and forehead containing stereo speakers and various cameras. It’s fairly small by modern standards, making it easy to handle and pocket, similar to the Pixel 2, Apple’s iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also light at 148g compared to the 177g iPhone XS and 168g Galaxy S9, both of which have slightly larger 5.8in screens.Gone is last year’s coated aluminium back, replaced with two-tone glass. The frosted bit is etched glass, which is super smooth, but is surrounded by polished glass and coated metal sides that aid your grip. The combination feels wonderfully smooth and luxurious in the hand. This is a phone you will want to fondle.In the centre of the back below the glossy panel is a fingerprint scanner as good last year’s. There are no other biometric security options, such as face unlock, despite the Pixel 3 having two front-facing cameras.The bottom of the phone has a USB-C port and a sim tray, while the right side volume button is joined by a mint green power button. There’s no headphone socket to be seen, but the camera only sticks out the back less than 1mm.The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor, the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is so buttery smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.The whole system, from switching apps to pulling up the camera, has a level of polish only matched by Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS. It’s not quite as brutally rapid as the OnePlus 6 in operation, simply because the animations play out for longer, but it’s easily faster and slicker than any other Android device.Battery life for the Pixel 3 is a moving target. Normally smartphones stabilise to a fairly consistent level after a couple of days of first starting them up.That was with consistent use as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify on Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix and shooting about 10 photos a day.Part of that is undoubtedly down to the Adaptive Battery technology in Android 9 Pie that learns your usage pattern and limits power to apps you don’t really use. It’s possible that over the next couple of weeks battery life may continue to improve, although it is unlikely to be by vast amounts.A full charge via the included 18w fast charger took 101 minutes. The Pixel 3 can also charge wirelessly at up to 10w, which is a little slower than via cable but still faster than some phones charge from their bundled chargers.The Pixel 3 runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie, which makes it one of only handful of phones to do so.The main advantages of Pie over previous versions are better notification handling, particularly around do not disturb (DND) modes, wellbeing tool integration for tracking usage and modes to deter usage, such as Wind Down, and great integration of AI systems.Exclusive to the Pixel 3 is Google’s smart compose for Gmail, which takes the advanced autocomplete you might have used in Gmail in the browser on desktop to the Gmail app on the phone. It’s scarily good at writing emails.Google has also removed the traditional home and overview navigation buttons, replacing them by a pill-shaped gesture button in the middle and a small back arrow to the left.The back button still does what you’d expect, but the gesture button does a number of things. Tap it to go home, tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant, flick it upwards once to get to the app switcher or twice to get to the app drawer (you can also go straight to the app drawer by dragging it further up the screen).Dragging the gesture button to the right turns it into a slider flicking between recently used apps as you move your finger across the bar. Flicking the button to the right switches straight to the last used app in the same way a double-tap on the overview button used to.It works fine, but there is a bit of getting used to and I don’t think it’s actually faster than the previous navigation buttons. It also isn’t as smooth and intuitive as Apple’s gesture bar system introduced with the iPhone X, or some other gesture systems used by the likes of OnePlus or Huawei.It is safe to say the Pixel 3 has one of the best, if not the best cameras available today.The rear 12-megapixel camera is capable of capturing stunning images, rich in detail, vibrancy and dynamic range. It is better than any other at bringing out detail and colour from high-contrast scenes where there are a mix of bright lights and dark corners thanks to Google’s HDR+ algorithms.Low light performance is also fantastic, and that’s before the promised Night Sight mode that will come in a software update soon, which Google says will be able to produce dramatically better night-time shots.What sets the Pixel 3 apart from the competition is that it can do all this with practically no user skill whatsoever – this is the point-and-shoot that will make you look like you know what you’re doing even if you don’t.Google’s Top Shot works as advertised, using on-device AI to discern if one of the many frames it captures before and after you hit the shutter button is better than your attempt, for when someone blinks or cuts across your field of view.Likewise, Super Res Zoom is far better than standard digital zoom, but can’t quite match the clarity of Apple’s hybrid zoom using the iPhone XS’s 2x telephoto lens at extended zooms.Two selfie cameras adorn the front: a standard 8-megapixel camera joined but a wide-angle fixed focus camera allowing you to zoom out one step. At normal zoom levels the camera captures a stunning amount of detail even in crummy lighting conditions – if you have flaws in your skin this camera will capture them in all their glory.The wide-angle selfie helps you fit more people in, but the images it captured aren’t quite as good.Portrait mode for both front and rear cameras has been improved, particularly around hair, and now with the ability adjust blur both in the background and foreground after the fact. The motion autofocus is also magic, making macro shots a lot easier – tap on an object and the focus follows it around.The Google Pixel 3 is available for £739 with 64GB of storage or £839 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.The Pixel 3 can be summed up in one word: refinement.Every element of Android 9 Pie is slick and responsive. It’s simple to use but powerful in its execution. From the simply brilliant camera to the auto-complete in Gmail, on-device AI proves truly useful. Plus you get at least three years of software updates, which is still a rarity outside of Apple’s iPhone.The outside of the phone feels luxurious, but in a different way to the iPhone XS. The way the etched glass blends into the polished glass and body looks and feels beautiful.Inside and out the Pixel 3 is more polished than any other Android smartphone, fully justifying Google’s entry into the big leagues.It’s not perfect, of course the battery life could certainly do with being longer, and a glass back will be less durable than metal. There’s also no face unlocking and the relatively large chin and forehead will look dated in a year or so.But there’s absolutely no doubt that if you don’t want a £999 iPhone XS, the Pixel 3 is the best small smartphone going.Pros: super smooth and fluid performance, great screen, squeezable sides, Android 9 Pie and 3 years of updates, water resistant, fantastic camera, wireless chargingCons: relatively large chin and forehead, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, battery life could be better, no face recognition"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13067aa35dd50bf522f047579f712c7b3e6d67d1/366_506_5061_3037/master/5061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ca60e890eec938754ea8071b3ac8d6","title":"send tip haunted places chance to win a 200  pund hotel voucher","story":"Go on, try to scare us with your most haunted or spooky places to visit across the UKThings that go bump in the night, ghostly footsteps or ghastly apparitions … With Halloween just round the corner, we’re steeling ourselves to hear about haunted day trip locations around the UK, be they pubs, ancient monuments or other “attractions”, particularly if they have a horrific history attached.Please be specific about locations, with websites and entrance costs where appropriate, and ensure your tip stays within around 100 words.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e119a48076615b6502ceccd369bc72bcf5d93a/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d765ac40a5570c156b8f3ef618f9da3","title":"10 best things to do palm springs california us midcentury modernist hollywood","story":"Palm Springs’ modernist masterpieces are celebrated in this week’s fall preview but the mountain haven for the Hollywood set is worth a visit any time of yearIn the early 1920s, Hollywood stars adopted Palm Springs as a place to escape the travails of Tinseltown. They were wowed by the fine weather, laid-back vibe and views of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains – plus it was close enough to comply with the “two-hour rule” stipulating actors under contract had to be on call if needed by the studio. The Oasis Hotel, built in 1924-5 and designed by Lloyd Wright (son of Frank), led the way with its modernist design. More resorts, such as El Mirador, followed. Celebrities decided homes were more important than hotels, though, and along with now-revered architects – including Donald Wexler and Richard Neutra – concocted bold exteriors and sumptuous interiors. The MidMod Design Tour ($100pp) is a new architecture trip with designer Lyle Boatman that uses digital tablets to contextualise the tour. Palm Springs Mod Squad (from $70pp) offers an interiors tour, while Palm Springs Historical Society organises walking tours (from $20pp). Tours take in properties owned by Frank Sinatra, Elvis, Elizabeth Taylor, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Cher, Sammy Davis Jr and Leonardo DiCaprio. Rent a bicycle (Bike Palm Springs, from $23), pick up a guide at Palm Springs’ Visitor Center and visit at your own pace.Palm Springs isn’t a solitary oasis. Nine cities make up the Greater Palm Springs area: Palm Springs, Desert Hot Springs, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells (famed for its tennis tournament), La Quinta, Indio and Coachella, with around 30 (easy-driving) miles separating the first from the last. Gaze at them all in the dramatic desert setting of the Coachella valley from the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway. The tramcars rotate as they ascend 1½ miles through the Chino Canyon, arriving at the mountain station and cafes that are the starting point for exploring the Mount San Jacinto state park and its 50 miles of hiking trails.• Adults $25.95, children (3-10) $16.95, 1 Tram Way Palm Springs, pstramwayAmid the new hotels changing the look of downtown (such as The Rowan with its rooftop pool), fabled properties still thrive. Built in 1925, the Ingleside Inn became a Palm Springs institution through the ownership of Ruth Hardy (who ran it as a personal club) and its underground tunnels, which helped her dodge US prohibition laws. After years of neglect, Mel Haber bought it in 1975 and also opened its restaurant, Melvyn’s. The restaurant, with its tableside dining and Sunday afternoon jazz, became the place for celebrities to hang out. Sinatra was a fan, calling in advance to advise his entourage was en route. Naturally, he had a regular table: at the back, near the kitchen. Grab food or a cocktail and soak up the atmosphere, but know this: the martini packs a punch as hard as an enraged Rat Packer spotting paparazzi.• Melyvn’s restaurant prix fixe lunch $20, prix fixe dinner $42, doubles from $171, inglesideinnCalm those credit-card fears, you’re not staying here … So stroll past the Instagrammers taking selfies in front of the hotel’s swish Arabesque exterior and the “Drugs” sign in its lobby and make for the speakeasy-style Counter Reformation bar.

If over-indulgence causes guilt, don’t worry, the bar has a confession booth. The hotel was once owned by cowboy-movie star Gene Autry and in the 1960s was used as a training residence for the baseball team he owned, the California Angles.• 4200 East Palm Canyon Drive, parkerpalmspringsA parking lotin Palm Desert is an unassuming start for this 20-mile cycle adventure, which involves riding along a section of the San Andreas Fault. However, the support vehicle (and its trailer of bicycles) ascends nearly 500 metres before riders are prepped for the all-downhill ride. As the Big Wheel Tours’ publicity says: “There are no crossroads, no turns, and very little traffic.” But there are the jagged strata and palo verde trees of Box Canyon and views of the Salton Sea. Riders also pass the desert training centre set up by General Patton to train US troops in the second world war. The support vehicle dawdles behind as you cycle and there’s time to savour the sights and smells of the grape country near the town of Mecca.• Big Wheel Tours’ Earthquake Canyon Express Bicycle Tour (4-5 hours, including refreshment) $105ppIt’s worth a pre-dawn start to see the eeriebeautiful sight of the cross at the top of his walking trail illuminated amid a desert setting.

The views from the top – of the Santa Rosa Mountains, the cities of Palm Desert and Indio and, in the distance, Joshua Tree national park – are worth the effort. It’s just as entrancing towards sunset.• Park and start at the trailhead at Ralph AdamsCap Homme Park, Palm DesertThis mile-long shopping strip in Palm Desert, 25 minutes’ drive south-east of Palm Springs, gets its nickname because of the 300-plus high-end boutiques, jewellers, salons, art galleries and restaurants along its flower and statue-lined street.

All the things that are so unsettling about him – the cold, glinting eyes in the cuddly frame, the oddly aggressive “jokes”, the sense of malevolence always threatening to break through that strenuous geniality – would then make sense. It is a long-term, tour de force performance that makes Jodie Comer in Killing Eve look like Noele Gordon in Crossroads.None of this was laid to rest by the documentary How to Get a Good Night’s Sleep (Channel 5), presented by Holmes and his – it is taking every ounce of strength not to preface this with “long-suffering” – wife and This Morning co-host, Ruth Langsford.Both parties have sleeping disorders. Holmes rarely gets more than three consecutive hours’ shuteye and Ruth snores, which is the cue for much humour-adjacent commentary from her beloved. “Do they have duct tape?” he asks as she researches anti-snoring chinstraps on the web. She greets his every utterance with peals of laughter. It is mentioned elsewhere in the programme that Ruth drinks a lot of wine.The programme is bewildering tosh from end to side. The first quarter is taken up by Holmes scoffing at the price of the beds recommended by “bed guru” Brent Cooper. The average person, you see, spends about £450 on theirs. Brent prefers anything up to £110,000. Eamonn and Ruth try out a £28,000 ordinary bed and then a £42,000 one with hydraulics to shift them into exactly the right position. (Viewers at home are advised that they can buy a mattress topper for £200.) By the first ad break, it is clear that anyone with a problem sleeping should just watch 15 minutes of How to Get a Good Night’s Sleep.But we have angered God and there are 45 minutes left and no power cut delivers us from it, so on we go. Through the mishmash of meaningless andor doubtful statistics and unprovable assertions (“Replacing an uncomfortable mattress can give you an average of 42 minutes’ extra sleep!” “Britain is on the verge of a sleep deprivation epidemic!” “You will get sicker quicker without sleep than without food!”). Through the mandatory collection of esoteric experts who stretch the bounds of patience and credulity. There’s the bed guru, of course. Then the “only dental sleep practitioner in the country!” at a Harley Street sleep clinic who bodyscans Ruth with a computer to determine that her posture is causing “upper airway resistance”. On we plough, through the equally compulsory handful of ordinary people dragooned into joining Ruth and Eamonn on their journey towards the arms of Morpheus. The comedy is provided by Jenny Chapman – “Britain’s loudest snorer!” and the noise pollution expert with the recording devices is deployed to prove it – and the tragedy by a young woman who has had chronic insomnia since she was widowed in 2016. She is shown sifting through a memory box alongside one of their two little children. “I don’t think I’ve grieved yet,” she says. “I identify with you,” booms Eamonn later. “Because you’re an overthinker.” Ruth has her professional smile fixed on at this point. I begin to feel as if I need a bit of a lie down myself.It’s all quite stultifying. At one point, we are shown Jenny – a woman already well aware of the loudness of her snoring over the past 20 years – being shown the evidence of her snoring levels that we have already been shown. In the end, everyone gets a bit better, either through bunging airway reinforcers up their noses or by following guidelines from a sleep clinic. You may not have been entertained, but you have not been informed either.How stuff this bad continued to get made in 2018 will be a question to vex TV historians down the ages. Possibly they will find the answers in the contractual archives locked in the breakfast television bunkers (“Ah, look: clause here that says three of a presenter’s passing thoughts – be they only of the most glancingly casual acquaintanceship with return on financial investment – must be put into production per annum”), or possibly they will simply see it as proof of the eternality of the nearly Barnum adage that no one ever went broke underestimating the public’s appetite for crap.

Who knew?The show, to be broadcast in late 2018, will “pay tribute to one of the world’s greatest groups. Combined with the wonderful Joanna Lumley, this will offer a unique celebration of twenty years of the Black Eyed Peas”, according to the press release. Lumley said that she was both a “friend to and big fan of” the band. “It’s very exciting to be part of this and I’m looking forward to it enormously.”It is, of course, difficult to know were to begin. Who realised Black Eyed Peas had been together for 20 years? Are they really … one of the “world’s greatest groups”? How is Lumley friends with them? Did she ever call Fergie to explain that the bridge in her video for her solo single, London Bridge is, in fact, Tower Bridge? Who commissioned this show and were they very tired and frazzled at the time?The answer to the final question might have something to do with the fact that, as ITV Studio’s creative director put it, lead singer will.i.am is a “much-loved part of the ITV family”. The rapper and producer joined the channel in 2017, when it acquired talent show The Voice from the BBC, on which will.i.am appears as a judge. His contract was rumoured to be worth £2.5m.Lumley, meanwhile, has become a familiar presenting face on British screens. In 2008, she stayed at an igloo hotel during a trip to see the Northern Lights for a BBC One documentary. For ITV, she has fronted more travel documentaries, including her Silk Road Adventures, and a recent series on India. She also succeeded Stephen Fry as the host of the Baftas earlier this year.The Black Eyed Peas, whose current members also include apl.de.ap and Taboo, rose to fame in 2003 with their breakout hit, Where is the Love?, which became the biggest selling single in the UK that year.The band’s other hits include Don’t Phunk With My Heart, Don’t Lie, Pump It, and (unfathomably) My Humps. Reaction to the Lumley-Peas mashup was as expected. That is to say, entirely unexpected. Buzzfeed’s television editor, Scott Bryan, at first assumed the press release was a hoax, and everybody else was equally confused. The jokes came fast on Twitter:The BBC Radio 4 account tweeted that though Lumley appeared on Desert Island Discs in 2007, no Black Eyed Peas tracks made the cut. (Elvis Presley, Wham! and Beethoven did).However, it turns out there is precedent for Lumley’s friendship with the band. A 2014 BBC documentary saw Lumley follow will.i.am around Los Angeles (Joanna Lumley Meets will.i.am). In a trailer still available on the BBC site, Lumley says of her new pal: “He is an extraordinary man … from all the research I’ve done, he just never stops talking.”The two perhaps bonded over their many tangential projects. Lumley’s include a love of garden bridges and advocacy for Gurkhas (which led to a chutney endorsement). will.i.am has a foundation for education in his name, and a tech company that is looking to move into artificial intelligence.No word yet on whether Julie Walters will be interviewing Maroon 5, but we’ll keep you updated as and when."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e49f22d5f31b06d031997ccba88393c1f5fb055/0_579_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10b7213bb62534b5a1ff6894ec427694","title":"ann coulter believes the left has lost its mind should we listen","story":"The bestselling author has been criticized for dog-whistling to the far right. Now she’s taking aim at the left – can progressives learn anything from their sworn enemy? In person, Coulter, the bestselling author and personality who has recently taken to comparing the liberal media to cancer cells, is friendly and seemingly earnest. Her face is free of the smirk it often wears in photos, but she has the same long, lean features and razor-straight hair that have been plastered on the dustjackets of so many books, and the same unblinking intensity.Coulter’s authority as an unofficial mouthpiece for President Trump’s base is rivaled only by the revulsion she elicits from progressives. She is not the type of pundit who persuades by appealing to the middle ground. In 2004’s How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must), she offered 10 rules: “Outrage the enemy”, “Never apologize”, “Never compliment a Democrat”, “Never show graciousness toward a Democrat” – some of the rules overlap – “Never flatter a Democrat …”During her two-decade career, Coulter has followed these rules carefully. She has accused a group of 911 widows of reveling in their husbands’ deaths lamented that Timothy McVeigh didn’t park his truck in front of the New York Times building argued that the increasing popularity of soccer in America is a sign of moral decay and been fired from MSNBC for telling a disabled Vietnam veteran on air that people like him were to blame for losing the war. (She later said she didn’t know he was disabled.)In response, Coulter has been described, variously, as a human submachine pistol (Lloyd Grove, Washington Post, 2002) a “paid banshee” and “self-drawn cartoon” (David Carr, New York Times, 2003) “She-Devil” (John Edwards, 2007) “Trump’s Aryan Witch Enforcer” (conservative critic Charlie Sykes, 2016) and “troll” (multiple citations).Few consider Coulter a serious intellectual. But she’s a good debater – charismatic, dexterous, always ready with a talking point or quip. She also has an occasional, uncanny ability to sense political undercurrents that others miss.In June 2015, three days after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, Coulter appeared on an episode of the Bill Maher show. She told him that, of the 17 Republican primary candidates, Trump was the one with the best chance of winning the White House. The room erupted in laughter. She then proceeded to tell an incredulous Maher that Bernie Sanders was the only Democrat who could beat Trump.No one is laughing now. But that includes Coulter, because Trump’s first year and a half in the White House have been, well, something less than a resounding success – a fact Coulter attributes to Trump’s failure to fulfill campaign promises, like building a wall on the Mexican border, and, perhaps more importantly, failure to follow her advice.For someone who only two years ago wrote a book titled In Trump We Trust (subtitle: E Pluribus Awesome!), she has become one of his fiercest critics. Last year a meeting at the White House deteriorated into, the Daily Beast reported, “profanity-laced” shouting between Coulter and Trump. (He swore first, Coulter later said.)Trump memorably claimed he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue without losing votes for her part, Coulter, an evangelical Christian, has said she doesn’t care if Trump performs abortions in the White House as long as he follows through on restricting immigration.She still supports Trump, for lack of a satisfying alternative, but living the Trump presidency has been bitterly disappointing. “Every other day I want to strangle him,” she tells me.In her latest provocation, Resistance is Futile! How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind, Coulter argues that progressives, by responding hysterically to Trump, play into his hand. And “the contempt the Democrats have for ordinary people, for what they call ‘deplorables’?” she tells me. “You’ve got to flip that around.”Coulter arrives at a recent radio taping at Compound Media (“the free speech network”). She douses her hands with sanitizer, rubbing her long fingers together, and explains that she has a cold and can’t shake hands or embrace. She offers fist-bumps instead.Coulter is a late riser who usually sleeps till noon, though she makes an exception for media opportunities.She takes her responsibilities as a self-publicist seriously, and works at a relentless pace. While promoting her third book, 2003’s Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism, she gave 160 interviews in less than a month, according to the New York Times’ late David Carr.Coulter and the other guests assemble in the studio. Coulter chews on nicotine gum. Host Bill Schulz opens by plugging her book.Coulter says, “I’ve been a little upset with the president for keeping – let’s see – none of his promises,” adding that her book is “excellent advice for the ‘Resistance’”, though “unfortunately they all hate me with the hot, hot hate of a thousand suns, so they won’t read it.”Trump “doesn’t have a history in politics”, she says later in the conversation, and “he hasn’t thought deeply about a lot of these issues –”“WHAT,” Schulz shouts in mock outrage.The other panelists agree with Coulter’s lackluster assessment of the Trump presidency but there seems to be a consensus that the left’s response is histrionic and will backfire.“These attacks, this stuff from the left – this is what’s going to get him re-elected,” another guest, the comedian Dave Landau, says.Coulter’s sometimes-affinity with Trump is unsurprising in addition to a shared enthusiasm for hand sanitizer, both owe their success to a willingness to say out loud the things other people think in their heads. Those who read Coulter’s books – all have been bestsellers – and devotedly follow her media appearances love her because she articulates suspicions many Americans hold: that the media has a leftwing bias that progressives shut down disagreement by crying racism or sexism that neither party cares about the working class.Her audience is “a narrow band of people”, Carr once observed, “who nonetheless number in the millions”.“Immigrants are great if you’re rich,” Coulter tells me. “You live in New York or LA, you get your pool cleaned. Rosa the maid cleans everything, serves, picks up the kids, makes the beds. Life is grand. But I go out to America. And I knew that immigration was an enormous effing issue that our political class – Republicans for the donor money, Democrats for the votes – was ignoring.”In June 2015 Coulter published Adios America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole. The book argued that unchecked immigration, both legal and illegal, was increasing crime, straining the welfare state, and depressing blue-collar wages, and that the media, because of political correctness, and big business, for cheap labor, were preventing honest debate.The book’s most serious charge has since become a mainstream allegation by conservatives: if Democrats have their way, Coulter claimed, they will add up to 30 million new voters to the rolls – overwhelmingly dependent on big government and loyal to the Democratic party. In other words, liberal elites support mass immigration because they are thumbing the scale of democracy itself.Then an interview she did about the book went viral. “I’m in a cab on the way to the airport and I get a text from Trump’s people: ‘Mr Trump would like a copy of your book overnighted to him.’ So I did. And two weeks later he’s talking about Mexican rapists. He has uncanny political instincts.”In the Atlantic, in December 2015, the former Bush speechwriter David Frum described Coulter’s book as the “political book of the year”. “Perhaps no single writer has had such immediate impact on a presidential election since Harriet Beecher Stowe,” he added, in a sentence that might cause consternation to the author of the antislavery novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Frum argued that rosy liberal claims about immigration are not borne out in statistics. Although some immigrants have assimilated well – he cited Nigerian Americans – other immigrant communities suffer from high unemployment, welfare dependency, and educational failure, he said.In an incisive recent piece in Current Affairs, a left-leaning journal, writer Brianna Rennix acknowledged that Coulter was probably correct about Democrats (and Republicans) exploiting immigration for cheap labor and votes. But Adios America! is a “vicious, dehumanizing” book, the review said, and one with eugenic undertones.Rennix added that the book, which cites stomach-churning examples of crimes against women in immigrant communities, seemed more bothered by the fact that these crimes occurred in America than the fact that they occurred.Trump, however, loved Coulter’s book. And Coulter loved Trump. He was, she believed, a kind of idiot savant. When recalling the moment on 16 June 2015 that Trump came down the golden escalator to announce his candidacy, she sounds like a Christian describing when she was born again. She threw all her energy into getting him elected.Two years later, the gold varnish has worn off.But she still loves Trump for his ability to antagonize progressives and the media – whose tendency to overreact, she argues, is what always saves him. This is terrain that Coulter, more than almost anyone, understands.Or as she once put it: “When the spittle starts coming from liberals’ mouths, you know you have struck gold.”Two days after her taping with Bill Schulz, Coulter has another radio show, with Mark Simone of New York’s WOR 710. After a show Coulter often goes to lunch with the panelists, but she is still sick, and possibly still contagious. A social function would invite handshakes, which would be socially irresponsible – and perhaps risk foreign agents infiltrating her immune system and making her sick all over again. One can’t be too careful.Hygiene and physical perfection are preoccupations of Coulter’s. She is fond of the word “retarded” as a term of disparagement (though she has said she would never use the term to refer to “someone with an actual mental handicap”), and in Adios America! writes contemptuously of disabled immigrants. She told me she believes pretty girls are more likely to be conservatives.Coulter does agree to join me at a cafe in SoHo. Since a 2004 pie-throwing incident at the University of Arizona (“They missed, because liberals throw like girls”), Coulter has taken greater security precautions, sometimes including a bodyguard. She navigates New York with a highly developed sense of which areas are “safe” for her – none, really, outside the Upper East Side.At the cafe she glances at the menu but orders only a chai latte to accompany her nicotine gum. “I have a few coastal elite habits,” she says when I raise an eyebrow at the latte.Last December, after Marco Rubio announced that he would not support the Republican tax bill unless it included more provisions for low-income families, Coulter tweeted, “We singles live empty lives of quiet desperation and will die alone. Now Rubio is demanding that we also fund happy families with children who fill their days with joy.”But besides noting, in passing, that she has dated men who drive motorcycles, Coulter declines to say much about her romantic life. She has never been married, though she has been engaged, she says vaguely, “two or three times”. Previous boyfriends include Dinesh D’Souza, the rightwing pundit Trump pardoned for making illegal campaign contributions. D’Souza recently unveiled a new film, Death of a Nation, exploring parallels between Trump and Abraham Lincoln.The only other question Coulter refuses to answer is her age. According to the New York Times and Wikipedia, she is 56. (Coulter tells me information online is incorrect and she has been trying to get a hold of Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, to fix it.)Coulter has an active social life and many friends, including in liberal bastions like Hollywood. Some of these friends, such as a successful screenwriter and producer who asked to be anonymous, keep their relationship with Coulter discreet to avoid falling victim to what the screenwriter called “reverse McCarthyism”.Although she claims to despise the coastal elite, Coulter’s upbringing, in New Canaan, Connecticut, epitomized establishment values. Her father, John Coulter, was an FBI agent who hunted Soviet spies after retiring from the Bureau he became a union-busting lawyer. He met Coulter’s mother, Nell, while working an FBI assignment at a uranium plant in Kentucky. The Coulters were conservative, religiously observant (mother Presbyterian, father Catholic) Americans of Scottish descent, frugal and not given to displays of emotion. John Coulter was “of the old school, a man of few words, the un-Oprah, no crying or wearing your heart on your sleeve, and reacting to moments of great sentiment with a joke”, she wrote in a 2008 eulogy for her father.Discussion during family dinners focused on politics, which Coulter has credited with refining her debating skills.“Father didn’t care what popular opinion was,” she writes. “There was right and wrong.” He was contemptuous of moral relativism on issues like abortion, and she recalls “the look of disgust” on his face when he saw a picture in the newspaper of Senator Ted Kennedy, a Catholic Democrat, praying a rosary.Coulter brought her father’s uncompromising politics to Cornell, where she co-founded the conservative Cornell Review. After law school at the University of Michigan she spent several years doing dreary legal work in New York. In 1995 she moved to Washington DC to work for the Senate judiciary committee.Coulter’s first book, High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton, was a methodical argument for impeachment. In contrast to her later books, the tone and style were lawyerly and self-consciously serious.The book was notable in another respect. At the time, many liberals, including prominent feminists, excused Clinton’s affair with Lewinsky as consensual, or painted Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern, as a power-hungry harlot. Coulter argued that the power difference between Clinton and Lewinsky made the relationship inherently inappropriate and exploitative.(Perhaps to avoid being mistaken for a hero of intersectional feminism, Coulter has since expressed interest in revoking women’s suffrage.)Detractors on both left and right have accused Coulter of using coded language to appeal to the alt-right.In September 2015, during a televised Republican debate in which the candidates kept reverting to platitudes about supporting Israel, Coulter tweeted, with characteristic tact: “How many f---ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?”The conservative writer David French argued in National Review that Coulter was dog-whistling to a “very small, very angry crowd that’s far more white nationalist than it is recognizably conservative”. (“Dog-whistling,” Coulter says when I describe French’s accusation. “How original!” She calls French’s writing “stupid” and “boring”.)“In 20 years,” Coulter declared on Twitter last year, “Russia will be the only country that is recognizably European.”“She means white,” a commenter explained, for anyone wondering.VDARE, an anti-immigration website that publishes explicit white supremacists, carries Coulter’s column. The website is named for Virginia Dare, believed to be the first English child born in North America Dare died at the mysterious, doomed Roanoke colony, a fate the group’s founders believe could be prophetic for white North Americans.Coulter is a longtime friend of the site’s founder, Peter Brimelow, and credits him in the acknowledgements of Adios America! (She also credits Peter Thiel.) Brimelow denies his site is racist. It publishes people such as Jared Taylor, founder of the white nationalist magazine American Renaissance, and John Derbyshire, who was fired from National Review for his writing on race.Charlie Sykes, a writer for the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, told me Coulter was once an asset to the conservative movement, but morphed from “intellectually substantive to demagogically sensationalistic, much like the movement itself”. He added: “Her willingness to traffic in racial and ethnic bigotry has done incalculable damage, because she’s normalized it for a huge swath of conservatives.”There is nothing inherently racist about restricting immigration, Coulter says. She calls the left’s attitudes about immigration hypocritical.She argues that the mainstream media ignores serious problems associated with immigration, especially violence and drug crime.Low-skilled immigration “drives down wages for low-wage workers”, Coulter tells me. “Of course it does. What is your counterargument? You’ve repealed the laws of supply and demand?”The journalist Sam Quinones, author of Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic, acknowledged this in an op-ed last year. “I recognize the anger of citizens at the bottom of the economy who must compete with those in the US without permission,” he writes. “I don’t like to hear them characterized as racist simply for pointing it out.”But, he adds, Americans enjoy cheap goods and services because of immigrant labor. Trump voters want “to eat their cake and keep it, too”.Sykes argues that Coulter’s anti-immigration, anti-trade, anti-globalization stance “isn’t conservative in any meaningful sense of the word” and “has more in common with European-style popular-front nationalism than conservatism”.“I think what Coulter represents has always been a recessive gene on the right,” he tells me. “But, until recently, it’s been a minority point of view that was held in check.”The auditorium of the politan Republican Club on the Upper East Side is packed to capacity. Late arrivals stand in the back. Everyone chatters excitedly as they wait. The crowd varies in age but skews overwhelmingly white. An earnest man with an eastern European accent strains to see the podium. “I was much closer to Trump and Melania,” he says wistfully, and shows me photographs he took when he saw them in Washington. He glows as if they are photos of his children.Undocumented immigrants are the single greatest threat facing America, he feels. At least “every second one” are violent criminals, and even the ones who aren’t are still here illegally. If it were up to him, he says, they would be eligible for only three “benefits” – immediate deportation, jail with hard labor, or the electric chair.His ideal policy would also pare down legal immigration, almost to zero, “like Japan”, and admit only the most highly skilled applicants, strictly on merit. (This aspiration is somewhat puzzling Japan is in economic and cultural crisis because of its rapidly shrinking population, and without an influx of new blood it may lose a third of its population this century.)Aren’t you an immigrant? I ask.Yes, he says, from Latvia. He was granted asylum during the cold war. In any event, he hastens to add, he has more than earned his keep.Coulter comes into the room to a standing ovation. “The main thesis of my book,” she says, “is that the media are liars – every one of them.”This turns out to be a popular message. The audience loves her. She has no prepared remarks, instead moving from topic to topic using her best lines, often verbatim from the book.On Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice: all Trump has done is lie to the media, which is legal, and “there is nothing wrong with lying to the media. In fact I recommend it.”One audience member asks Coulter to speak to the significance of the massive online media sphere that has flourished as an alternative to the liberal mainstream media.“For democracy to live we must kill the media,” Coulter says. “There may be a rash of reporter suicides – have no sympathy.” We must destroy the media, and rebuild it on “more ethical lines”.The time has come for her greatest line of all: Trump, she says, is chemotherapy for the country. The process won’t be pleasant. “We’ll get sick, we’ll throw up, it really sucks. But the entire New York Times editorial board dies.”The audience explodes, clapping wildly, shrieking in laughter, heads thrown back like hyenas at the site of a kill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4ddc3d39e78b1d3726ec6e552f339d632406f4d/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=848533fff871335c01ad226cbf4d80a0","title":"hurricane michael american quality lodge panama city florida","story":"Long-term residents of the American Quality Lodge in Panama City, along with people from the area, are living amid destruction after Hurricane Michael Simply getting through the day is a struggle at the American Quality Lodge, a low-rent motel where dozens of people are living in squalor amid destruction left by Hurricane Michael.Families huddle under makeshift tents and in breezeways strewn with broken glass and roofing fragments, seeking escape from Florida’s midday sun. They line up in a parking lot for food and water whenever volunteers and church groups stop by.There has been no power in a week, and the water has been out for days. Nighttime means relief from the heat, but also brings the threat of looters. Residents say people have stolen money, jewelry, food and even rain-soaked clothes from rooms ripped apart and left open to the elements by Michael. “Basically, if you were living here before the storm you were homeless. This was our last resort,” said Jeannie Holcombe, who has been at the motel a few months with her husband, Jason. “It’s worse now.” Michael’s winds of as much as 155 mph (250 kph) ripped much of the roof off the two-story red-brick motel, which is just miles from the white sands of Panama City Beach. Rain flooded the upper level and dripped down to the first floor. The place looks absolutely shattered, with tarps strung from the second-floor balcony providing some shade. Rooms reek with the pungent smell of wet clothes and perspiration windows are missing from many. Long-term residents, who pay out about $180 a week a room, abandoned blown-out rooms for ones with fewer leaks or doors that will shut. Other people simply showed up from surrounding areas and settled in. Some asked permission, others didn’t. Joe Donahue, who works for a company that was taking over management of the motel as Michael struck, has been driving store-to-store in search of supplies water, and feminine products for the women. He said he doesn’t mind people staying there for now. “I have no place to send them because everything is booked,” he said. “It’s a nightmare.” Vicki and her husband Wes Allen are stuck at the 135-room motel with their three children, including 17-year-old Allison Allen, who is seven months pregnant. Someone pilfered $21 that was set aside for her unborn daughter, they said. It’s not like it’s a huge amount of money, but that would have been a couple outfits for her,” said Allison, whose twin sister Kristin is also at the motel along with their older brother, Wes Allen Jr. Residents credit their father with risking his life to rescue 10 people during the worst of the storm, helping them leave rooms torn to shreds by the wind. Four family members sometimes use wheelchairs because of back problems. The sidewalks and walkways littered with storm debris make it hard for them to get around. The grassy courtyard is filled with sticky tarpaper from the roof, shattered lumber, empty drink cans and bed linens blown outside by Michael. After getting permission from the Holcombe couple, Bill Yourn resorted to salvaging pennies from the floors and drawers of their shattered rooms. He had to climb through a broken window and walk across a soggy floor littered with shards of glass and personal items like deodorant, hair care products and clothes. “Life’s not great,” he said after eating lunch: a can of tuna scooped with a borrowed spoon. The water came back on a couple of days ago, providing a morale boost, and utility crews are installing new power poles just across the street. But Donahue said the motel is so badly damaged, it wouldn’t be safe to turn on the power even if electricity were available. Residents say police and firefighters have been by to make sure the people are safe, but these survivors say they didn’t bother to report any of the looting at the motel, because the first-responders seem so busy. Someone from Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) also visited, they said, but no one has offered them any better alternatives yet. And so they sit, most without transportation and many without phones for communication, waiting for a fresh delivery of food and water. Some trade cigarettes for other items. One man filled an inflatable kiddie pool, shaped like a pirate ship, to provide a place for youngsters to play. From her wheelchair, Vicki Allen considered their fate. “Six days after Michael came through and tore up everything, we’re still here,” she said. The hero of the American Quality Lodge, Wes Allen, 48, the man who plucked vulnerable residents to safety during Michael, chimed in. “We can’t stay here like this too much longer,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dce15b17ace4b2b90e87ee3b870e7b7f1bdc474e/0_187_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd7545c3ec0b795f6367f52257a44b9c","title":"orange county turn blue republicans democrats","story":"In the affluent area of yachting marinas and country clubs, some Republicans are growing tired of Washington’s rancorDan Ardell has been voting Republican all his life, but not this November.In many ways he is a conservative from central casting: a churchgoing 77-year-old retired businessman from Orange county, the suburban expanse between Los Angeles and San Diego that was once said to be where good Republicans went to die.Ardell voted for Barry Goldwater over Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter, and George W Bush over Al Gore. But now he has had enough – enough of Donald Trump, certainly, but also enough of Dana Rohrabacher, the beguilingly soft-spoken but reliably out-there rightwing congressman who in 30 years on Capitol Hill has never previously faced a significant election challenge.“Rohrabacher is of the same caliber as Trump,” Ardell said. “They’re low-level, relatively unintelligent people. Trump has no civility, no common sense. He can’t even spell the word nuance.”Ardell’s list of grievances goes on: how Trump and modern-day Republicans have erased any pretense at fiscal responsibility, how they are destroying America’s international alliances and wiping out global trade. “There is no more Republican party,” he lamented. “With Trump, it’s gone.”One might think such views would make him an outlier in a district represented by Rohrabacher, a cheerleader for both Trump and Vladimir Putin who believes America should not tolerate undocumented immigrants or offer a path to citizenship, sees Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as enemies of the US, believes climate change is a “total fraud” and thinks property sellers should be allowed to turn away homosexual buyers.In fact, Ardell is part of a growing trend of disaffected Republicans along Orange county’s coastal strip, an area of yachting marinas and country clubs, strip malls and cookie-cutter housing estates in the hillsides overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Many of them have spent their lives identifying with the GOP – pro-business, suspicious of high taxes and regulation, strong on law on order – but now they are tired of the rancor and the classlessness emanating from Washington and looking for a new political home.“There’s a lot of people like me,” Ardell says. “A ton of ‘em.”That disaffection presents a golden opportunity to Democrats and explains why California’s 48th congressional district is right at the top of the party’s hit list as it seeks to retake control of the House of Representatives in November’s midterms. The opportunity is not just to bloody the president’s nose and send one of Washington’s quirkier representatives packing: it is to effect wholesale political change in a district once thought to be impervious to it.“There’s a cultural shift,” said Katherine Amoukhteh, an engineer who has been a registered Republican for 20 years but is supporting Rouda. “The party has changed a lot ... and that’s left us with one of two choices. Either we say, to hell with you guys and become Democrats or independents. Or we stay on the team and say, I may be a Republican but I don’t have to vote Republican up and down the ballot.”Amoukhteh hated the way Trump talked about women on the campaign trail and refused to vote for him. Then she looked at Rohrabacher and found she could not abide him either. “My litmus test was Roe v Wade,” she said. “How can we still be talking about whether women have abortion rights? I have a teenage daughter. I want to be able to look her in the eye and say, ‘I did the best I could.’”As is common in many affluent suburban districts, it is Republican women who are leading the charge. Two of them, both now Rouda supporters, told the  of the existence of secret wives’ clubs in Newport Beach whose members loathe Trump but have not dared tell or confront their husbands. These women meet in each other’s homes – many of them in the desirable Port streets overlooking Newport Bay – to talk politics, but won’t be seen together in public and won’t canvas or phone-bank for Rouda for fear of being found out.“Sometimes I think we should go around with T-shirts saying, ‘I’m married to a Republican’,” said Amoukhteh, who belongs to a non-secret group called Women for American Values and Ethics, or WAVE, that has grown from just a handful of members to 700 over the past 18 months.The 48th district is one of four in Orange county – and one of seven across California – that returned a Republican congressman in 2016 but also favored Clinton for president over Trump. Rohrabacher is the most conservative incumbent in any of those seats, but he also enjoys the most Republican-leaning electorate. That only raises the stakes higher, and with it the Democratic will to win.Two recent polls – one for the New York Times and the other for the Los Angeles Times – put Rohrabacher and Rouda neck and neck, with the number of undecided voters apparently shrinking fast. Rouda has been outraising Rohrabacher by a significant margin – he brought in five times as many campaign dollars in August – but both sides have seen massive infusions of support from their national party organizations and from independent groups whose spending is unlimited thanks to the supreme court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has taken the unprecedented step of setting up a satellite office in the 48th district to act as a regional hub for competitive races across the American west. Much of its focus is right in its backyard, where it says the intensity and spending levels are more akin to a Senate race.Rouda’s strategy is to sell himself as a pragmatist who rejects the politics of ision and is more than willing to reach across the political aisle to cut deals and advance legislation in everyone’s interest. “Common sense for common ground,” was the slogan he touted at a recent town hall in Huntington Beach.“I’m frustrated with both parties putting party first and country second,” he told an eclectic crowd of college students, Democratic party stalwarts, new arrivals in the district, and older, more conservative voters anxious about everything from healthcare to trade wars. “I don’t believe the current representative is doing the job you deserve.”Those who know Rouda say the campaign posture is an accurate reflection of who he is – a successful businessman who has nothing to prove and has thrown his hat in the ring solely to stop the country sliding in the wrong direction. He represents a strain of centrism that plays poorly to a national Republican audience – as attested by the failed presidential bids of former ambassador Jon Huntsman and Ohio governor John Kasich (whom Rouda backed in 2016) – but has fared rather better on the Democratic ticket in the Trump era.Rouda’s no-drama, get-the-job-done mantra carries significant echoes of Doug Jones’s successful Senate campaign in Alabama last year, against Republican opponent Roy Moore.The district does not lack for diehard Trump fans – not to mention a toxic culture of online political warfare that drags even elected officials into the mire – but polling shows that the electorate as a whole supports Dreamers (undocumented immigrants who came to America as young children), believes in protecting the Orange county coastline and has little patience for Rohrabacher’s conspiratorial rejection of climate science.Rouda’s argument that Rohrabacher is increasingly out of step with the district has been bolstered several times thanks to the congressman’s own actions. In July, Rohrabacher was tricked on national television by Sacha Baron Cohen into endorsing a bogus proposal to arm preschoolers. His later explanation, that he was referring only to older students, did little to allay consternation in district schools that have staged walkouts and marches in solidarity with the victims of February’s school shooting in Parkland, Florida.Last month, Rohrabacher endorsed a pro-Trump Huntington Beach school board candidate previously slammed for social media posts with racist and antisemitic overtones. This followed hard on reports that last year he and Senator Rand Paul hosted a rightwing activist accused by the Anti-Defamation League of being a Holocaust denier.Now he is being roasted for a political ad in which he claims to be fighting to keep healthcare coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions when in fact he voted repeatedly to remove that provision of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act.It doesn’t help that Rohrabacher is under close scrutiny for his ties to Putin’s Russia and to several key figures in Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation. One of Rohrabacher’s Republican colleagues, House majority leader Kevin McCarthy, was recorded in 2016 saying he thought Rohrabacher was on Putin’s payroll.The contrasting energy coming from the two campaigns could not be a starker. While Rouda is energetically barnstorming the district, with the help of a campaign manager and a communications director with deep Washington experience as well as a large team of outreach workers targeting Latinos, Vietnamese Americans and other interest groups, Rohrabacher has been barely visible, apparently banking on the power of incumbency and a defensive posture to see him through.He rarely grants interviews (a request by the  went unanswered) and has held only a handful of public campaign events. His key campaign aides appear to be his wife Rhonda and her twin sister, Rachelle Carmony, who work out of an upstairs room at Skosh Monahan’s Irish bar and steakhouse in Costa Mesa, sometimes dubbed the Liberty Lounge. A filing with the Federal Election Commission shows that in January the campaign claimed a $844.87 bill from Skosh Monahan’s as a campaign expense for “office utilities”.And so Rohrabacher has allowed most of the incoming fire to go unanswered: how he is beholden to the gun lobby, the oil industry and big pharma how he is inaccessible to his constituents how he has little or no legislative record how, in the words of Rouda’s campaign manager, Mike McLaughlin, “if you want Dana Rohrabacher to do anything, write him a check”.At an online “town hall” he aired on Facebook in August, Rohrabacher sought to attack Rouda in turn by accusing him and Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi of seeking to “buy” his seat and calling Rouda “a Daddy Warbucks developer without a lick of public service in his background”. It was telling, perhaps, that the town hall featured no apparent interaction with the public and that the Daddy Warbucks reference, from the 1980s film musical Annie, was unlikely to resonate with anyone under 40.The consensus is that, despite the district’s Republican lean, this is Rouda’s race to lose. Some campaign volunteers worry that the candidate and the party are not working hard enough to turn out working-class Latino voters, who could prove crucial if the election night count gets close, but whose visibility in the campaign could prove a turn-off to Republicans nervous about Rouda being too liberal on immigration.The disaffected Republican contingent, though, seem to like what they see. “He’s obviously very intelligent. He gets it,” Dan Ardell said after listening to Rouda, skeptically at first, at the Huntington Beach town hall. “What I heard tonight was a Republican talking.” And that, for him, sealed the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

Firms including KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, EY, Clifford Chance, Eversheds and HSBC bank were among those who responded to a UK Border Agency questionnaire issued in September 2010 as part of the consultation.The responses informed changes to investor visas, which offer UK residency, that were introduced in March 2011.New features included a fast track for the super-rich and a reduction in the number of days investors needed to spend in Britain in order to qualify. The annual number of successful applicants for the tier 1 investor visa, as the scheme is known, soared from 211 in the year the Conservatives entered government, to a peak of 1,172 in 2014. It was particularly popular with Chinese and Russian applicants.“Henley \u0026amp Partners was one of several firms who attended a roundtable event during the consultation,” the Home Office confirmed.Henley said it had been canvassed for its expertise but told the  it had “never formally advised” the UK government.The migration specialist, which has a head office in London and is run by the Swiss businessman Christian Kälin, has helped turn citizenship by investment into a $3bn (£2.3bn) global industry. Henley made its name marketing passports in St Kitts and Nevis and other Caribbean countries to wealthy foreign investors, and now operates a similar scheme in Malta. has revealed how Kälin exerted considerable influence in the Caribbean by introducing donors to political parties and working on election campaigns alongside Alexander Nix, the disgraced former boss of Cambridge Analytica. Henley has dismissed claims that it interfered in elections for commercial gain as “baseless”.Golden passports and visas are in the spotlight, with European politicians warning that schemes have been used to facilitate money laundering, tax evasion and sanctions avoidance.Britain’s so-called golden visa scheme allows wealthy families to buy the right to residency in exchange for a £2m investment in government bonds or actively trading British businesses. Unlike Malta, the British government does not employ private sector companies to design or market its residency scheme.During the 2010 Home Office consultation, policymakers were told by private sector specialists that rich iniduals were time-poor, and wanted to be able to apply for visas more quickly, according to sources who took part. Lawyers and migration specialists such as Henley, while not directly involved in running or managing the UK scheme, charge fees for helping clients obtain visas. The companies consulted therefore stood to gain if there was an increase in demand.On its website, Henley claims to have “regular involvement in the consultation process with the Home Office and UK Border Agency regarding the Tier 1 (Investor) category”.The Home Office’s March 2011 press release included a quote from Henley. “We applaud the Home Office on the introduction of these new rules,” an associate of the firm said. “With these changes, high net worth iniduals will be more likely to choose UK as their preferred country to reside as the physical presence requirements have been sensibly relaxed.”The redesign doubled the number of days per year that visa holders could spend outside the UK, from 90 to 180. It also offered iniduals willing to invest £5m indefinite leave to remain after three years of obtaining their visa, while those putting in £10m or more could apply to settle after two years. Those not prepared to pay the higher sums must wait five years.However, in 2015 the campaign group Transparency International warned that there were strong grounds for concern that the scheme was being used to launder the proceeds of corruption from around the world. The group pointed out that neither the Home Office nor the banks processing funds from applicants were making proper checks on their source of wealth.Vetting was tightened in 2015, but even today the Home Office has no idea how many of the iniduals who applied for visas fall into the politically exposed persons category. These iniduals – defined as current or former public officials and their families – present the highest corruption risk.In the wake of Russia’s state-sanctioned poison attack in Salisbury, the government announced it would review all 700 visas given out to Russian nationals between the scheme’s launch in 2008 and 2015, because of concerns about money laundering and national security.The Home Office said it had carefully considered a range of responses from open consultation and engagement with a wide range of stakeholders to inform its policy. It added that decisions were taken by the government, taking into account all of the available evidence, and that no outside parties were involved in the final decisions.Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International, said between 2008 and 2015 there was a “blind faith” period during which 3,000 applicants were granted entry to the UK without checks on the source of their wealth being required.“The changes lobbied for by law firms in 2010 which were eventually put into law by the government in 2011 made the UK Tier 1 Investor scheme more attractive both to those with legitimate wealth as well as those with illicit funds,” said Hames.“Due to the increased incentives for investing higher amounts of money, it is likely that far in excess of £3bn was invested through the system during this time.”Hames said it was not unreasonable that stakeholders in visa programmes should make submissions to the government, “but it’s absolutely imperative that government recognise the interests of those companies, be transparent about their submissions and ensure they receive a balanced array of views on the subject”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a45b7055bc8ed0be5bd08ea3a50f0c9533a2112a/0_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da10162b8c2888fab5f1d8438efd50cb","title":"a new leaf the hardy trees reforesting the amazon","story":"Scientists in Peru have found tree species that thrive in land poisoned by gold miners now they have started plantingFlying above the Tambopata River in a single-engine Cessna turboprop, the panorama is desolate. Jungle rivers are ripped open into a delta of sand dunes and stagnant, discoloured ponds. Ant-sized bulldozers roll down mud paths on the soggy moonscape dotted with glinting corrugated iron rooftops.Amid the roar of the propellers, Cesar Ascorra eagerly points to a cluster of newly planted saplings in the sand. They are evenly spaced, like a polka dot pattern, but the area they cover is dwarfed by the swathe of destruction carved by illegal gold miners.“It’s a start,” says Ascorra. “We’ve reforested 42 hectares (104 acres) of land deforested by illegal gold mining,” he says.But the damage goes beyond felling trees. Around 180 tonnes of mercury are dumped every year into the rivers, lakes and soils of the bioersity hotspot which was visited by Pope Francis in January, according to studies by Peru’s Artisanal Gold Council.As part of the reforestation experiment, scientists are trying out tree species which can survive in the sand left behind by mining. They are also using bio-char compost, made from locally grown Brazil nut shells, to block the absorption of mercury from the soil into the trees and to regenerate the topsoil.Among the saplings planted is the mighty Shihuahuaco which could grow to be one of the tallest trees in the forest and is the preferred nesting place for the rare harpy eagle.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theMiles Silman, head of the Wake Forest Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainability which partners with CINCIA, says these are by far the largest trials of restoration on mined lands in the lowland tropics.The practice is not confined to Peru but is common in the forests of Brazil, Colombia and increasingly Venezuela, driven by its economic crisis.“Mining is about as destructive a land use as you could think of short of nuclear annihilation,” he tells the . “But, there are trajectories where it is a tragedy, full stop, and there are trajectories where you are left with a landscape that can heal for future uses.”At this experimental stage, the scientists are “looking at methods and technologies to address the problem at scale,” he explains. The next step, he says, is to work with the miners and communities to “implement them at scale”.The gold fever, which exploded after the 2008 global economic crisis and the metal’s vertiginous price rise, has brought tens of thousands of fortune-seeking migrants to the jungle from poor Andean regions nearby.While the use of mercury is cavalier and commonplace, some miners have been persuaded to try out new machinery which uses gravity separation and bypasses the use of the toxic heavy metal to bind with the gold.The mining corridor stretches like a festering wound along the basin of the Madre de Dios river, and has spread to other rivers. But there are still provinces untouched by mining, such as Tahuamanu, at the intersection of Peru, Bolivia and Brazil, which has become a model for sustainable forestry.“The way to go forward has to do with science and technology,” says Kurt Holle, the new director of WWF Peru who for two decades ran Rainforest Expeditions, an eco-tourism business in Madre de Dios.“You have to form citizens who want to do, rather than have to do, what is right for nature,” he says, citing his experience in engaging an indigenous community in nature tourism and creating a natural buffer against mining.Mining’s get-rich-quick appeal makes its spread seem inexorable, but some local people are fighting to secure their region’s long term survival.“We bring the science closer to the people to help them solve everyday problems,” says Ascorra.“There’s still a lot of green and the green is hope.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The game should have begun 15 minutes earlier, but one of the teams had not even entered the changing room. And it never would.The Afro-Napoli United players were staying off the pitch in protest at the exclusion of their 27-year-old captain and midfielder, Concetta “Titty” Astarìta, by the club’s managers over her decision to run as a member of a political coalition headed by Matteo Salvini’s far-right League in upcoming local elections.The team’s president disapproved of Astarìta’s decision because Afro-Napoli – which plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football – is composed of migrants and Italians and, according to a statement issued by the club, “was formed with the purpose of inclusion and integration to give a voice to a multi-ethnic Italy which has been the target of discrimination and racism”.The club’s president, Antonio Gargiulo, said he had no regrets about the decision.‘‘We cannot tolerate that our captain is one of Salvini’s allies. Salvini is the man who has closed the ports to rescue ships carrying migrants and who detests the integration projects that are the basis of the principles of this team,’’ he told the . “So we had no doubts about our choice. It’s the girl who has to clarify her decision, not us.”Astarìta has defended her choice: “I am a person who very much believes in integration in all its forms and the Afro-Napoli project is a great example of racial integration but I would have never thought they could do this. I’ve been playing football since I was 12 years old and made a lot of sacrifices to get here.”When, two days before the game, Astarìta returned the captain’s armband at evening training and told her teammates of the club’s decision of the club to exclude her, she was embraced by her fellow players.They said in a statement before Sunday’s game that they stood with Astarìta. “Our decision not to take the field is due to the serious episode of discrimination against our captain, who has been excluded from the team for political reasons. Let us not forget that sport should be non-partisan and apolitical.”The news soon spread around Italy and the club’s decision was picked up by Salvini, who on Monday tweeted: “The only racists are those of the left. Keep politics out of sport.”But Astarìta, who has received hundreds of support messages from all over Italy, is keen to point out that she does not share many of Salvini’s ideas, especially those related to immigration. ‘‘I do not agree with his decision to close the Italian ports to boats that help migrants, for example and I do not like the extremist ways in which he implements policies to control migratory flows,” she told the .Her exclusion from the team has opened a debate in Italy about the right to express ideas and the one to defend anti-racist principles in a country where government decisions are playing out in the relationships between citizens in everyday life like never before.The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in March reported the news of a Milanese ice-cream maker who was fired by her boss for refusing to serve a gelato to Salvini. In September, crowdfunding saved a bar in Ventimiglia whose owner, Delia Buonomo, had offered a hot meal to passing migrants on their way to France. Her business faced ruin when it was boycotted by citizens who did not like the presence of asylum-seekers.“Politics in Italy has always influenced everyday life, this is inevitable,” Astarìta said. “But it is not right that it influences sport. When we take to the pitch we are all the same. Ideas, religion or skin colour do not matter.”Gargiulo, overwhelmed by the criticism, is ready to withdraw Afro-Napoli from Serie C.“It was painful for us to ask her to choose sides. But for Afro-Napoli, the spirit of the sport is best defined by the raised fist of Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the Olympics in Mexico City in 1968. We cannot accept that one of our players is on Salvini’s side and also on our side.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d57868185d53790fb0d0f97c5159c913eba8a4c8/0_34_1791_1074/master/1791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b87a701abedb8b0cdb24b9c9b72f049","title":"thursday briefing mays long kiss goodbye","story":"PM hints at extended post-Brexit transition … Trump denies trying to take heat off Saudis in Khashoggi crisis … and the shame of erection failureHello, it’s Warren Murray teasing out the threads you need to be following today.“EU leaders dined on pan-fried mushrooms, fillet of turbot cooked in wheat beer and a trio of fruit sorbets while they discussed their next steps on Brexit following a 15-minute meeting with Theresa May, who was not invited to dinner.” And there on a plate you have the most substantial details to emerge from the PM’s visit to Brussels.As she addressed EU27 leaders, May did make noises about extending the post-Brexit transition period to keep the Irish border open.

The UK “tier 1 visa” scheme allows high net worth families to buy residency in exchange for a £2m investment in government bonds or British businesses. Successful applications soared under the Conservatives to reach a peak of 1,172 in 2014. It was particularly popular with Chinese and Russians. Today the Home Office has no idea how many of the iniduals are “politically exposed” persons who present a high corruption risk. Seven hundred visas given out to Russians are being reviewed in the wake of the Salisbury novichok poisonings.“If you look at the rise of easily accessible pornography, people have an expectation that men are going to be great performers,” says Raymond Francis, a London psychotherapist.

One purpose of the leaves is to release hormones that prevent buds from flowering ahead of time.Wada told the public broadcaster NHK that the unusually warm weather that followed the typhoons may have also “tricked” the buds trees into flowering.“This has happened in the past, but I don’t remember seeing anything on this scale,” he said.Wada reassured cherry blossom lovers that there was no reason to cancel plans for hanami picnics when the regular viewing season comes around next spring.While the affected trees would not bloom a second time, the vast majority of Japan’s blossoms would flower as usual next March and April.“The buds that opened now won’t blossom in the coming spring,” he said. “But only a small number of them are being observed. I don’t think it will affect cherry blossom viewing next year.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days offer prospective students a unique opportunity to sample life on campusWhat you need to know to make sure you take full advantage of your open day opportunityOpen days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will be"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"US student distributed the sugar biscuits with several classmates, police saidRoyal College of Physicians of Ireland urges mandatory vaccine to protect patients\u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoIpsos MRBI poll finds overwhelming majority backs Varadkar\u0026rsquos stanceOwen Keegan says he is \u0026lsquovery disappointed\u0026rsquo by rejection of proposed \u0026euro10m Dublin schemePolicy of switching to biosimilar drugs never adoptedO\u0026rsquoFarrell and \u0026Oacute Cairbre of Maynooth University honoured for raising public awarenessUncertainties over the future force Portwest to set up distribution warehouse in PolandThat\u0026rsquos Maths: You\u0026rsquod be surprised how many people use mathematics at workPresidential nominees criticise Peter Casey\u0026rsquos comments on the Traveller communitySchool principals say practice is deepening socio-economic ide in Irish educationWhile lifes are increasing in most countries, healthy lifes are notHousing charity says it \u0026lsquoincorrectly characterised\u0026rsquo upfront tenant payment to mediaGarda\u0026iacute estimate that drug haul found in dwelling would have a street value of \u0026euro595,000FF TD becomes emotional as she says she will not opposes passage of legislationEU competition to offer tickets for travel next summerAuditor Peter Smyth to complete review ordered after resignation of Denis NaughtenLeo Varadkar attending EU summit dinner in Brussels as May comes under pressureMen living in direct provision began project in JulyDean Ruxton\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoWhen the Hangman Came to Galway\u0026rsquo born of \u0026lsquopainstaking\u0026rsquo archive trawlHiggins calls for team of local artists to be appointed to provide creative lead"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Virgin Media One\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidates gather before the Virgin Media debate on Wednesday Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Presidential candidate Peter Casey has said people who turn down “free houses” should be put to the bottom of the housing list.Mr Casey, who has stoked controversy following comments he made on the Traveller community on Wednesday, refused to back down from his position during the debate, televised by Virgin Media.Asked about the issue by host Pat Kenny, the candidate said he did not believe a Traveller family in Co Tipperary should have rejected six homes built at a cost of €1.7 million.He claimed the family had requested two stables per home and a half acre of land for horses. The details of the issue have been disputed.“You can’t please all of the people all of the time,” Mr Casey said when it was put to him that the Traveller community would no longer like him.He added that if a person was offered a free home and declined they should go to the bottom of the housing list.Fellow candidate Gavin Duffy said Travellers were a part of Irish society with different requirements.President Michael D Higgins said the awarding of special ethnic status to the Traveller community was enormously significant, while Sinn Féin candidate Liadh Ní Riada said Mr Casey’s remarks were offensive.Mr Casey had sparked controversy over remarks he made regarding the Traveller community and his belief they should not be afforded a separate ethnic status.Mr Casey’s comments drew criticism from Pavee Point, the Traveller representative organisation, which called on him to leave the presidential race.Mr Casey, however, countered that the Traveller community had been poorly represented by Pavee Point.Liadh Ní Riada was pressed on her attitude toward IRA violence. Asked in particular to give her views on the Enniskillen bombing, she said: “Any atrocities like that should be condemned” but said the IRA were gone and the new era should be built upon rather than revisiting the past.President Higgins was challenged about not participating in all scheduled debates. He repeated the line that he had to balance his official duties with those of his candidacy.“We said we will do as much as we can,” he said, referring to a number of election appearances he had committed to.“I have been turning up since 1969 and I have stood in every election,” he added.Challenged on his salary and expenses, President Higgins said he took a 23.6 per cent pay cut and had not drawn down either his Dáil or ministerial pensions since being in office.He angrily dismissed several of Peter Casey’s assertions, denying he had flown to Zurich in a private jet and clarifying that a flight to Belfast was deemed necessary for security reasons.“Just add it to the list,” he said, dismissing the claims levelled at him by Mr Casey.The President also addressed the long-running issue of expenses, which has been debated at the Public Account Committee, given their (the expenses)relative lack of transparency. President Higgins said he had inherited the same expenses system that had pre-existed his term in office and that ultimately, all spending was signed off on by the Comptroller and Auditor General.Each candidate was asked to state their position on the issue of salary. Joan Freeman said she would take the entire €350,000 salary but use a portion of it to give awards to community volunteers.Mr Casey said the remuneration should be in the region of €120,000 and that he would give his to charity, while Liadh Ní Riada, in a similar position, said it should be halved.Sean Gallagher said for him the issue was transparency around expenses. He said it was “shocking” to learn they had not been audited under Michael D Higgins for the last four years.Later, Gavin Duffy said it was “bizarre” that three of the candidates had come from the Dragon’s Den television programme. “I can only apologise,” he said.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3666776.1539795514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ibec cancels event to promote saudi links amid khashoggi controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSaudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi:  was last seen entering the Saudi  diplomatic mission in Istanbul on October 2nd. Business group Ibec has cancelled a conference involving the Saudi ambassador to Ireland over the presumed killing of a dissident journalist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The State’s largest business representative group decided to call off the trade and investment conference to promote Irish business links to Saudi Arabia that was due to be held in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin on Thursday.Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi leadership and a columnist for the Washington Post, was last seen entering the Istanbul diplomatic mission on October 2nd. Saudi Arabia initially said that he left the building unharmed, but it has since been alleged in Turkey’s pro-government media that Mr Khashoggi was tortured and killed inside the consulate. A spokeswoman for Ibec confirmed it was going to cancel the event. Saudi ambassador Nail Al Jubeir was listed as one of the named speakers and Ibec chief executive Danny McCoy was also due to speak.“I would like to advise that Ibec has decided to cancel tomorrow’s joint trade and investment event with the Irish Saudi Arabia Business Council, ” Mr McCoy said in a short follow-up statement.The National Union of Journalists, which had earlier called for the cancellation of the event, issued a statement welcoming Ibec’s decision.“This conference has been planned for some time and it is appropriate that in the worsening situation in Saudi Arabia that the govenrment and Irish companies take a new look at plans to strengthen links with the Saudi regime,” said Séamus Dooley, the NUJ’s Irish secretary.Ibec represents companies employing about 70 per cent of the Irish private sector workforce and is the biggest business lobby group in the country. It has more than 230 staff and 42 trade organisations. The decision to pull the conference follows the decision of several high profile business people to withdraw from a Saudi conference in response to Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance.They have withdrawn from the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi that the country’s crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman hoped would showcase the country’s economic future.Those withdrawing from the event, dubbed “Davos in the Desert” by US media, include David Bonderman, co-founder of private equity giant TPG Capital, tycoon Richard Branson, media investor Arianna Huffington and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase.

File photograph: Government handoutPA WireAn overwhelming majority of voters believe that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar should stick to his position on Brexit and should not compromise to achieve a deal with the UK, the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll has found.The poll also shows that most voters are “very concerned” that any sort of new Border would damage peace in Ireland. As European leaders gather in Brussels for talks about Brexit – first with the British prime minister and later without her – the poll demonstrates significant backing for the Government’s position on the issue, which is supported by the main parties at home.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar emphasised again this week that while the State is willing to hear suggestions on how the Border backstop – the guarantee there will be no return to a hard Border after Brexit – is reflected in the UK’s withdrawal treaty with the EU, it will not compromise on the principle of having a backstop. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, as well as EU heads of government arriving in Brussels last night for the Brexit talks, all agreed with the Government’s stance.Asked if the State “should stick to its position of avoiding any sort of new Border or should it be prepared to compromise to help achieve a Brexit deal?”, 72 per cent of voters said that the State should stick with its position.Just one-fifth of voters (20 per cent) said that the State should be prepared to compromise, while 8 per cent expressed no opinion.Support for maintaining a hard line is consistent amongst voters of all parties (strongest in Fianna Fáil), areas, age groups and social classes.The vast majority of voters also say they are concerned that any new Border imposed after Brexit would threaten the peace process in the North.In the survey, voters were asked: “If Brexit results in some sort of a new Border, how concerned, if at all, would you be that this Border would damage the peace on the island of Ireland?”More than half of all voters said that they would be “very concerned”, while a further 25 per cent said that they would be “fairly concerned”.Just 12 per cent said they would be “not that concerned”, while 5 per cent said they would be “not that concerned at all” about a new Border. Four per cent did not express an opinion.Older voters were the most concerned by the prospect of the return of some sort of Border on the island after Brexit.The poll was conducted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week among a representative sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 and over, in face-to-face interviews at 120 sampling points covering all constituencies. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

They are, after all, the supreme decision-making authority of the union.\u0026nbspAnd there are those consigned to the Sisyphean task of rolling huge boulders endlessly uphill, of trying to maintain some impetus in the movement of the great, but ever-stalling European projects.That, alas, is the nature of the summit – or summits, I should say, all six of them in different configurations – currently under way in Brussels. \u0026nbspThere’s the “tripartite” social summit with the social partners, and the Brexit summit of 27 remainer states yesterday, the European Council summit proper today, the Euro summit at lunchtime with 27 euro members or would-be euro members, and then the Europe-Asia summit tonight and tomorrow with 21 Asian leaders, followed by the EU- Korea summit.On Brexit, the leaders of the 27 had hoped to be giving formal approval to a Brexit deal which could then go on to be ratified by the European Parliament and the Commons.Instead, however, over dinner last night they have \u0026nbspheard another state-of-play report from the union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, expressed their confidence in his labours, and told him to continue his good work and to come back when he is ready to summon another summit.In the unlikely event that British prime minister, Ms May, unveiled a dramatic new, groundbreaking initiative, It may have been discussed, but then referred to Mr Barnier’s team which, alone, can negotiate. But they must be resolute, as council president Donald Tusk urged in his letter of invitation to leaders: “As someone rightly said: ‘It always seems impossible until it’s done.’ Let us not give up.”There is some sympathy for the idea floated in recent days by Mr Barnier of extending the UK transition period by a year – although the UK would have to ask\u0026nbsp for it. But, as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar made clear on his way into the meeting yesterday, it is neither a solution nor substitute for the backstop. That, Mr Varadkar insisted, would have to remain as a guarantee of no hard border. And in a similar boulder-rolling vein, this morning the leaders of all 28 (summit two) will hear a report from the Austrian\u0026nbsp presidency, in the form of its Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, on very limited progress made since June on tackling migration. Notably on three aspects: co-operation with countries of origin and transit, the fight against people smuggling networks and the recent commission proposals on returns, the beefing up of the asylum agency and the European border and coast guards.What Mr Kurz will not report on is the long-promised reform of the so-called \u0026nbspDublin regulations, the rules governing responsibility for dealing with asylum seekers where they arrive in Europe. Austria does not approve of burden-sharing and so Mr Kurz has decided it is a matter for the next presidency.They will also hear a number of reports on strengthening internal security including a response to the latest cyber-attack on the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague.\u0026nbspSimilarly on the euro, they will hear a report on how prepared the legislation is on strengthening monetary and banking union for its December deadline.But their lunch is likely to be enlivened by Dutch premier Mark Rutte’s determination to warn Italy about the irresponsibility of its recently published budget targets in breach of EU rule. It could provide the summit with its only good row and light relief.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Ms May’s problem is that, with so little political room for manoeuvre at home, any sign of a concession to the EU  could trigger a cabinet revolt. Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergAs Theresa May faced the other 27 EU leaders for the first time since last month’s rancorous encounter at Salzburg, she was at pains to stress the progress that had been made over the past year. She pointed to last December’s joint report, which agreed to put a backstop in place to guarantee no hard border in Ireland as an example of the two sides’ capacity to find agreement under inauspicious circumstances.In her bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and again when she addressed the 27 leaders, May restated her commitment to a “legally operable” backstop. This was not a concession but it was an assurance that Britain is not seeking to resile from the commitments it made last December and in March.In March, the prime minister agreed that the backstop would remain in place “unless and until” a permanent solution is found to keep the Border open. Last night in Brussels, she and the Taoiseach agreed that such a permanent solution should be found in the future economic relationship between Britain and the EU.After the debacle at Salzburg and the failure of negotiators to reach agreement on a withdrawal agreement this week, it was important for the prime minister to persuade the other leaders that she is serious about finding a solution to the impasse over the backstop. Last night, she asked for their help in finding a creative solution to the “dilemma” of the backstop.But European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said the prime minister had offered nothing new in her 15-minute address to the ministers. May’s problem is that, with so little political room for manoeuvre at home, any sign of a concession to the EU 27 could trigger a cabinet revolt.Downing Street responded gingerly to the suggestion by Michel Barnier and other EU politicians, including minister for foreign affairs Simon Coveney, that the post-Brexit transition period could be extended. Such an extension would give Britain more time to negotiate a trade and customs deal with the EU and make it less likely that there would be any gap that would require a backstop to come into operation.But for Conservative Brexiteers already disillusioned by the slow place of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the prospect of following EU rules and sending money to Brussels for another year could be too much to bear.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: TRT WorldThe dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared after he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul just over two weeks ago, and evidence increasingly suggests he was brutally killed.But on Wednesday night, a new piece of his work – submitted by his assistant after he disappeared – was published by The Washington Post, for which Mr Khashoggi worked as a columnist.In just over 700 words, his column lamented the dearth of a free press in the Arab world, which he said “is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors, but through domestic forces vying for power.”He sought to promote the free exchange of ideas and information under the headline, “What the Arab world needs most is free expression.”Mr Khashoggi’s editor, Karen Attiah, wrote a preface to the column. She said she received the file from Khashoggi’s translator and assistant a day after he was reported to be missing.“The Post held off publishing it because we hoped Jamal would come back to us so that he and I could edit it together,” Attiah wrote.“Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen. This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post.”The column came amid reports of audio recordings suggesting that Khashoggi was met by his killers shortly after he walked into the consulate in Turkey on October 2nd, and that his fingers were severed and he was beheaded.Saudi officials have denied harming Mr Khashoggi, but they have not provided evidence that he left the Saudi consulate, or offered a credible account of what happened to him.US president Donald Trump appeared to take Saudi officials’ claims at face value, disregarding Turkish assertions that senior figures in the royal court had ordered his killing.The president told reporters Wednesday that the United States had asked for copies of any audio or video evidence of Mr Khashoggi’s killing that Turkish authorities may possess – “if it exists.”In his column Wednesday, Mr Khashoggi wrote that government clampdowns on the press in the Arab world were sometimes met with little resistance.“These actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community,” he said.“Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence.”In Saudi Arabia, Mr Khashoggi once served as an adviser to and unofficial spokesman for the royal family. But after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman barred him from writing in the kingdom, he traveled to the United States.He reinvented himself as a prominent critic of the Saudi government – and of the crown prince in particular – and became a resident of Virginia.On October 2nd, he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to pick up a document he needed to get married. His fiancé was waiting outside. But Khashoggi never came out.His column Wednesday was reminiscent of ones he had written before, which often condemned human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. He wrote that he had been reading a Freedom House report on political rights and civil liberties around the world, and it ranked most countries in the Arab world as “not free.”“As a result, Arabs living in these countries are either uninformed or misinformed,” Mr Khashoggi wrote.“They are unable to adequately address, much less publicly discuss, matters that affect the region and their day-to-day lives.”He wrote about the hopes that had been shattered across the Middle East after Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 failed in several countries. And he wrote about governments’ efforts to imprison dissidents, block internet communication and censor the media.He suggested the formation of a transnational media outlet – like Radio Free Europe, which was created by the United States government during the Cold War – that could be a platform for Arab writers, reporters and thinkers.“We need to provide a platform for Arab voices,” Mr Khashoggi wrote.“We suffer from poverty, mismanagement and poor education. Through the creation of an independent international forum, isolated from the influence of nationalist governments spreading hate through propaganda, ordinary people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural problems their societies face.”In her note, Ms Attiah wrote that Mr Khashoggi’s column “perfectly captures his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world. A freedom he apparently gave his life for.” – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3667031.1539811099!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may asks eu leaders for help with northern ireland backstop impasse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach  Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May during a bilateral meeting in Brussels yesterday.  Photograph: PABritish prime minister Theresa May has asked European Union leaders to help her find a creative way out of the impasse in Brexit negotiations surrounding the Northern Ireland backstop. Addressing the 27 leaders at the start of a summit in Brussels on Wednesday night, Ms May said she remained fully committed to a legally operable backstop to guarantee there can be no return to a hard Border.The prime minister said that, despite the failure of British and EU negotiators to reach a deal on the withdrawal agreement ahead of the summit, the two sides had defied expectations in the past. She recalled last December’s joint report and progress in March and June on elements of the withdrawal agreement and on a transition period.“We have shown that we can bring difficult deals together constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome,” she said. “The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.”Ms May spoke for between 15 and 20 minutes and then left before the 27 other EU leaders had dinner and discussed the state of Brexit negotiations. Before the dinner, she had bilateral meetings with European Council president Donald Tusk, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, French president Emmanuel Macron and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. “I will be talking to leaders tonight about the very good progress that has been made since Salzburg both on the withdrawal agreement and our future partnership. The teams have been working very hard to ensure we can address these issues. We have solved most of the issues in the withdrawal agreement,” Ms May said as she arrived in Brussels. “There is still the question of the Northern Irish backstop. But I believe everybody around the table wants to get a deal. By working intensively and closely, we can achieve that deal. I believe a deal is achievable and now is the time to make it happen.”Asked about EU chief negotiator’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s suggestion that the post-Brexit transition period could be extended by a year, Ms May declined to rule it out. Downing Street said only that Britain was not proposing an extension beyond the current date of December 31st, 2020.In London, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said that a “meaningful vote” in parliament on the final Brexit deal should offer MPs a simple choice between accepting or rejecting it.“Once the deal is presented to parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision, and one which is clear to the British public. Another other than a straightforward approval of the deal will bring with it huge uncertainty for business, consumers and citizens,” he said in a letter to the House of Commons procedural committee.Pro-European MPs want to be able to table amendments to any motion on the Brexit deal so that they are not faced with a choice between accepting an unsatisfactory deal or allowing Britain to leave without any deal.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Mohammed al-ShaikhAFPGetty ImagesHis killers were waiting when Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. They severed his fingers during an interrogation and later beheaded and dismembered him, according to details from audio recordings published in the Turkish news media on Wednesday.It was all over within a few minutes, the recordings suggested. A senior Turkish official confirmed the details that were published in the pro-government daily newspaper Yeni Safak. The leaking of such details, on the same day US secretary of state Mike Pompeo was visiting Turkey, reflected an escalation of pressure by the Turkish government on Saudi Arabia and the United States for answers on the fate of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent dissident journalist who wrote for the Washington Post.Fifteen days after he entered the consulate in Istanbul and was never seen coming out, the Saudis have yet to give an explanation. Top Saudi officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance – denials that they repeated to Mr Pompeo when he visited Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. A team of 15 Saudi agents, some with ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was waiting for Mr Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate the moment he arrived, at about 1.15pm on October 2nd. After he was shown into the office of the Saudi consul, Mohammad al-Otaibi, the agents seized Mr Khashoggi almost immediately and began to beat and torture him, eventually cutting off his fingers, the senior Turkish official said. “Do this outside. You will put me in trouble,” Mr Otaibi, the consul, told them, according to the Turkish official and the report in Yeni Safak, both citing audio recordings said to have been obtained by Turkish intelligence. “If you want to live when you come back to Arabia, shut up,” one of the agents replied, according to both the official and the newspaper. “Horrendous tortures were committed on Khashoggi, who came to the consulate for documents,” the Yeni Safak account said. As they cut off Mr Khashoggi’s head and dismembered his body, a doctor of forensics who had been brought along for the dissection and disposal had some advice for the others, according to the senior Turkish official. Listen to music, he told them, as he put on headphones himself. That was what he did to ease the tension when doing such work, the official said, describing the contents of the audio recording. Such information would not have been disclosed in Turkey without the consent of the government. Turkish media outlets and newspapers are closely controlled: They are either government-controlled or owned by pro-government business executives. Censors are often present in newsrooms, and reporters and editors take close instructions from officials in the presidency.The Turkish leaks implicating Saudi officials in the Khashoggi case have followed a distinctive pattern, beginning quickly after his disappearance. The leaks stopped when President Donald Trump suggested that he was taking the accusations seriously and sent Pompeo to Saudi Arabia for answers.But the leaks appeared to resume after Saudi leaders repeated their denials of involvement to Mr Pompeo, and Mr Trump defended the crown prince as having been unfairly accused. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump said the administration had requested access to recorded evidence from the Turkish authorities “if it exists” and that it “probably does”. Mr Trump also said he expected to get a full report from Mr Pompeo when he returned. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies

cant get meal without checking mobile phone yougov survey","story":"Most people can’t make it through a meal without checking their mobile phonesMost people can’t make it through a meal without checking their mobile phones, new research from YouGov has found.According to a survey of more than 2,000 people 55 per cent said they checked their phone during dinner, while 53 per cent said they look at their phone even when dining out with friends or family.Such is our addiction to our mobile devices that more than half (54 per cent) said they could not go more than two days without their phone before it bothered them, and one in five said they couldn’t cope being without their phone for four hours.In a bid to tackle the growing addiction to electronic devices a number of national campaigns, such as Scroll Free September, were launched to help users cut down on their mobile device use and raise awareness on the addictive nature of electronic devices. Both Google and Apple have responded to the growing debate about the impact of mobile phone use on public health by introducing usage tracking tools features to their devices in an effort to improve digital well-being.Last month Apple launched a new feature on iPhones and iPads designed to limit screen time, especially in children. Two thirds of mobile phone users check their phones while in bed The software update was intended to allow users track and limit the time they spend online to counter smartphone addiction, but hacks were quickly found to bypass the feature including manually changing the time on a device.Meanwhile the negative impact of staying in contact with your device has been well documented, especially when using social media. 5Rights, a children’s charity founded by Baroness Kidron, earlier this year said social media was so addictive for children that the Government should classify it as “social harm” and make it carry health warnings.The new research was carried out to mark YouGov\u0027s partnership with The Future Starts Here exhibition at the V\u0026ampA Museum, which examines Britain\u0027s increasing addiction to mobile devices and how it is changing human interaction.Russell Feldman, director of digital, media and technology research at YouGov said: “It will have escaped no-one\u0027s notice that smartphones are taking over our lives. Across the land, the sight of heads bowed over small screens is now ubiquitous.How to break your addiction to your phone“We can only speculate on the impact this is having in terms of our relationships with colleagues, friends and even close family. But our survey does suggest that traditional conversations are being discarded, in favour of checking our latest email, notification or message.”The YouGov research also indicated that two thirds of mobile phone users (65 per cent) check their phones while in bed despite sleep issues having been linked to the blue light emitted by phone screens and other devices. Almost half of those surveyed also admitted to checking their device when waking up in the middle of the night.Scientists have found that the blue light emitted by electronic devices can trick the mind into thinking it’s daytime and have since issued common advice to switch off all your electronic devices an hour before bed.Some hardware manufacturers have since introduced night light features to lower the amount of blue light emitted by devices in an effort to reduce the impact of late night usage.Mr Feldman added: “What our research shows is just how attached to our mobile phones we really are - and perhaps without even realising it.”Theresa May says Brexit could be extended by a \u0026#39matter of months\u0026#39 amid row with Tory MPs Duke and Duchess of Sussex given \u0026#39long list\u0026#39 of baby names by family and friendsComment: The launch of \u0026#39BBC Sounds\u0026#39 shows radio is not what it used to beThe Saudi-Turkey struggle to control the narrative over missing journalist Jamal KhashoggiBoris Johnson and David Davis tell Theresa May the British people \u0026#39will not forgive us\u0026#39 for Brexit surrenderComment: No deal is better than partition, or reducing Britain to a vassal stateTrump pulling out of pact that discounts foreign postal deliveries in move against ChinaIn \u0026#39final column\u0026#39 missing writer Jamal Khashoggi says Arab states can silence media with impunityComment: Donald Trump has captured the Democratic Party and his populist takeover is completeBrexiteers express fury at plan to delay UK\u0026#39s final departure from EU Cobalt airline tells passengers not to arrive for flights as it suspends operationsFocus on slavery is putting black children off history, teachers warnedHospitals \u0026#39plugging\u0026#39 shortages of nurses by using cheaper workers, experts fear   Teacher accused of having sex with schoolboy on aeroplane will not face new trialPre-eclampsia could triple the risk of some forms of dementiaSocial media memes encouraging children to be overweight and lazy, academics have warned MPsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wildlife photographer year 2018 competition winners announced","story":"The winners of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition are revealed at a ceremony at the Natural History Museum, London, which runs the international competition.Dutch photographer Marsel van Oosten has won the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2018 title for his extraordinary image, The Golden Couple, which frames a pair of golden snub-nosed monkeys in the temperate forest of China’s Qinling Mountains, the only habitat for these endangered primates.

A isive figure, perhaps, but the far‑reaching nature of her legacy is never disputed.

competitors\u0026nbspface increasingly bleak outlookClick to followThe IndependentProfits at Asos have soared 28 per cent as the online fashion retailer delivered another strong set of results, in stark contrast to many of its high street competitors.While the outlook for traditional stores has become increasingly bleak in 2018 as shoppers switch online, sales at Asos\u0026nbspjumped by £500m to £2.4bn for the year to 31 August.\u0026nbspAsos\u0026nbspshares jumped 15 per cent after the announcement on Wednesday morning, taking its valuation to £4.8bn.\u0026nbspASOS creates sanitary pads for women in Kenya using spare fabricLondon-based Asos reiterated its plans to invest in continued expansion and chief executive Nick Beighton said the company\u0027s potential was “huge”.Asos, which specialises in fast fashion for young people, grew sales by more than a fifth in the UK and internationally, and has delivered 20 per cent increases for three years in a row.Profits came in at £102m, just beating expectations, despite the heavy cost of upgrading its warehouses to keep up with demand.“The potential for our business is huge and we remain focused on building Asos into the world\u0027s number one destination for fashion-loving twentysomethings,” Mr Beighton said.Some analysts had questioned whether the company\u0027s\u0026nbsprapid expansion may be slowing after it reported lower than expected sales in July.\u0026nbspAsos shares drop 10 per cent as UK retailers signal more gloomASOS praised for designing clothing with wheelchair users in mindAsos launches

despite today’s gains, the company’s share price, which is largely based on expected future growth, is still down around 12 per cent this year at £57.49.But Asos remains the UK’s leading online-only clothes retailer and predicted sales would jump by another 20 to 25\u0026nbspper cent this financial year.Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said Asos was far outpacing the online market as a whole and continuing to keep ahead of younger rivals such as\u0026nbspBoohoo\u0026nbspand PrettyLittleThing.“Unlike some of its competitors that have been blaming the prolonged warm weather for a disappointing performance over the summer, Asos’s sales accelerated in the last two months of FY201718 demonstrating the appeal of its proposition and the loyalty that Asos\u0026nbspPremier drives,” Ms Willmott said.The strong results again highlight the erging fortunes of successful online fashion retailers and their brick-and-mortar rivals.Debenhams, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and House of Fraser have all shut stores and shed staff this year as they try to cut the cost\u0026nbspof maintaining a presence on the high street.“Asos are cutting a dash in a fashion sector that has been looking a little tired recently,” said Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing.“Asos is expanding internationally, growing its market share in overseas territories and should maintain an advantage in its online proposition against rivals that will have to invest heavily to catch up.”George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results should put “niggling worries” to bed. “Asos\u0026nbsphas delivered strong growth despite a weak UK consumer environment,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

The latest official figures have shown that inflation fell to 2.4 per cent in September\u0026nbspa day after they revealed wages rose by 3 per cent. So rising real incomes. Hooray!\u0026nbspBut that\u0027s not true for everyone, and\u0026nbspI\u0027m talking here about those in the bottom half of the UK\u0027s income distribution.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHere’s why: The September inflation figure is a particularly important one for them because it is used to calculate increases to\u0026nbspbenefit payments.

The\u0026nbspfreeze\u0027s final year\u0026nbspwill, it says, cost one of those families £200 on average. The combined impact over the full four years comes to\u0026nbsp£580. \u0026nbspFor those just about managing, or not managing at all, that represents a gut punch.\u0026nbspThe policy will have\u0026nbsprealised savings of £4.4bn for the exchequer by the end of next year, of which the final year of the freeze is due to\u0026nbspcontribute £1.5bn.\u0026nbspTo give that a bit of context, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that another freeze, the one fuel duty\u0026nbspin place since the 2010-2011 financial year, and extended by Theresa May, costs the Treasury £9bn a year.\u0026nbsp“A car is not a luxury,” the PM declared when she announced it. But it is the wealthy with petrol eating luxury cars that will benefit the most.\u0026nbspIf the Chancellor were to increase the levy there would be more money in his coffers, and thus less need to skewer the poor to pay for it, which is what his party has\u0026nbspbeen doing.

Show’s over, they declared, and investors switched off the stock as if it were a bad drama, knocking 15 per cent of its value.\u0026nbspToday it’s hotter than third season of Stranger Things (would you just give us a release date?), with Netflix having smashed both Wall Street’s and its own subscriber forecasts.\u0026nbspIf anyone needed a(nother) demonstration of the folly of paying too much attention to a single shaky set of three month numbers it’s here.\u0026nbspNetflix shares soar after subscriber growth surges at a record rateThe sure-fire hits and movies you might have missed on NetflixIron Fist has been cancelled by NetflixNetflix’s guidance called for 5m net new subscribers to be added to the pile during the last quarter. The number came in at a smidgeon under 7m, a new record for the July to September period.\u0026nbsp“As a reminder the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy in our forecast,” said boss Reed Hastings, in anticipation of taking flak for the company’s prior pessimism. “This means in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance.”To under promise, over deliver, is smart. The trouble is that Netflix took it to such an extent that it’s made itself look a little silly, particularly given that there were good reasons for thinking that the third quarter would be better than the disappointing second.\u0026nbspIts slate looked a lot stronger for a start, with original content highlights including a new season of Orange Is The New Black, one of its flagships, as well as another run out for animated comedy BoJack Horseman and the second season of crime drama Ozark.\u0026nbspNetflix continues to invest heavily in its own shows, with more than a quarter of the $8bn it is spending on content going to the home team. That means it’s burning through cash at quite a clip, but the move is wise.\u0026nbspCompetition for externally produced fare is hotting up with a raft of new entrants seeking to join the streaming party, some in the US, but plenty elsewhere too. They may make it more expensive to buy things in, and could chip away at Netflix’s numbers,\u0026nbspBut with the way it’s steaming ahead, and with\u0026nbspthe performance of Netflix originals at the Emmys, there is every reason to believe that the streaming giant will cope.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Shares in the company plummeted by more than a third after the firm issued the profit warning. The group said consumer demand in both domestic and continental markets has weakened in recent weeks, and said it now expects this to continue in the second half. Combined with increased fuel costs and the continued weakness of the pound, will lead to an estimated £29m dent in profits.

We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.Analysts at Liberum said there are opportunities for Flybe to help itself, noting that the airline could increase revenue by putting in place new commercial systems, but said any attempts at self-help would be “more than offset” by current challenges linked to exchange rates and fuel prices. Earlier this year, Flybe said the Beast from the East had wiped £4m off its revenues, due to flight cancellations and delays and airport closures. Severe cold weather in February and March threw many people’s travel plans off track as snow, ice and strong winds wreaked havoc across the UK and Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The UK, which currently sits on the UN human rights council, has traditionally been hostile to the treaty, which is supported by Ecuador, South Africa and a number of other developing countries.Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said the vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of global problems including inequality and climate change.\u0026nbsp“The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Yet there are very few ways that citizens can hold these corporations to account for their behaviour. Rather, through trade and investment deals, it is corporations which are able to demand that governments do their bidding.\u0026nbsp“The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business.\u0026nbsp“Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN. That’s why today we’re joining campaigns from across the world to tell the British government not to block this international demand for justice.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shares in the company plummeted by more than a third after the firm issued the profit warning. The group said consumer demand in both domestic and continental markets has weakened in recent weeks, and said it now expects this to continue in the second half. Combined with increased fuel costs and the continued weakness of the pound, will lead to an estimated £29m dent in profits. The company now predicts that it will report a pre-tax loss of £12m for the current financial year. Flybe abandons a planeload of passengers in ItalyBeast from the East wipes £4m off FlyBe revenues Airline competition has benefited passengers, but there are limitsFlybe: “On a path to sustainable profitability” despite higher costsChristine Ourmières-Widener, chief executive officer, said: “We have made progress in driving our unit revenues across the summer season, but we are now seeing a softening in the market. \u0026nbspWe are reviewing further capacity and cost saving measures while continuing to focus on delivering our sustainable business improvement plan.“Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs. We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.Analysts at Liberum said there are opportunities for Flybe to help itself, noting that the airline could increase revenue by putting in place new commercial systems, but said any attempts at self-help would be “more than offset” by current challenges linked to exchange rates and fuel prices. Earlier this year, Flybe said the Beast from the East had wiped £4m off its revenues, due to flight cancellations and delays and airport closures. Severe cold weather in February and March threw many people’s travel plans off track as snow, ice and strong winds wreaked havoc across the UK and Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Rather than Chrome and Google search, as users have seen ever since Android was introduced, there could be something else entirely.The change is good news for other browsers and search engines, which could now come pre-installed on Android phones instead of Chrome.Given recent data scandals from tech firms like Facebook and Google, device manufacturers may decide to make a statement by introducing apps that focus on online privacy.Private search engine DuckDuckGo could be among those to benefit, which currently represents only 0.18 per cent of the global search market.The privacy-focussed search engine processes around 30 million searches per day – the same number as Google handles in about 15 minutes.What does this mean for Google\u0027s mobile dominance?More than 80 per cent of the world\u0027s smartphones run the Android operating system, and this is unlikely to change significantly as a result of Google\u0027s new licensing system.What could change is the pervasiveness of its search engine, apps and other features. Perhaps the\u0026nbspmost significant of the features subject to the fees is the Play Store, which serves as a gateway through which popular apps can be downloaded.Not all apps are available through Google Play – earlier this year, Epic Games decided to roll out the Android version of its hugely popular game Fortnite\u0026nbspthrough its own website in order to avoid paying\u0026nbspGoogle for the privilege of hosting the app on Google Play.\u0026nbspBut this is an exception, not the rule.If the licensing fees prove too burdensome for phone and tablet manufacturers, this way of distributing apps may become a trend that threatens Google\u0027s monopoly of everything from email to maps.Google admits giving hundreds of firms access to your Gmail inboxEven without Google Play, Fortnite was able to amass more than 15 million downloads on Android within a month of launching, proving Google\u0027s app store is not a prerequisite for success.As Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney explained at the time: The great thing about the internet and the digital revolution is that this is possible, now that physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Twitter and Google have taken the same approach as Apple and added some kind of filling to their bagels, for instance, but have kept them closed Microsoft and Samsung\u0027s bagels are both plain, but they are cut open like Apple\u0027s one.Emoji that vary can cause genuine problems when people use them for communication. A 2016 study found a significant discrepancy in what the different emoji seem to communicate, and warned that it could lead to serious confusion when people send them across various platforms.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If such an event took place today it would likely disrupt much of the planet’s communication technology.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29.

Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.“I think it’s fair to say that Caroll’s view of the world and how we should treat each other has shaped and defined our organisation.”Oscar the GrouchShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A number of people took to the site to ask whether the strange notifications indicate they\u0027ve been hacked or refer to some other problem – but the vast number of them received in recent minutes suggests that is probably not the case.Some on Twitter joked about the difficult of trying to work out what the strange messages mean.But others just expressed surprise that people had notifications turned on for Twitter at all.Since this article was first published, Twitter confirmed to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat the bug should now be fixed.CEO Jack Dorsey posted that the company is working to understand why it happened, after he tweeted an earlier update that included a screengrab of the problem and was retweeted thousands of times.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government must ensure that disabled people who have been so unfairly treated are properly compensated.”Richard Kramer, chief executive of disability charity Sense, said he\u0026nbspwelcomed the news that ministers were getting to grips with the problem, but said it was important that there are no further delays to backdated payments.We must now see reform to a system that undermines disabled people, rather than engages and supports them. This includes an overhaul of the assessment process, which we know can be fraught with error, frustrating and humiliating,” he added.The government said it was in the process of reviewing about 570,000 ESA cases that could be affected, and that it expects to complete the process\u0026nbspby the end of 2019.A DWP spokesperson said: “Anyone affected by this historic error will receive all of the money they are entitled to. That is why we have created a dedicated team of over 400 staff to examine cases, and have paid back around £120m\u0026nbspso far.\u0026nbsp“We have worked with charities and other disability organisations to make sure that we are providing the right support to all affected claimants and are hiring and allocating more staff to do that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A source said they would convene a summit only “if and when” Mr Barnier recommended it was time to do so.The leaders’ decisions are expected to be reflected in an official summary of their conclusions published on Thursday.Ms May had the opportunity to address the leaders before dinner, although she was excluded from the final discussion about the way forward.She told them:\u0026nbsp“We’ve shown we can do difficult deals together constructively. I remain confident for a good outcome and the last stage requires trust and leadership on both sides.”The source said the leaders “stand ready to convene a European Council, if and when the Union negotiator reports that decisive progress has been made”. But they added that “for now, the EU27 is not planning to organise an extraordinary summit on Brexit in November”.Ahead of this week’s European Council, the body’s president Donald Tusk had said the meeting would be “the moment of truth” in talks. However, the emphasis appears to have been taken off the regular gathering, following the collapse of negotiations about the Irish border on Sunday evening.The prime minister held bilateral meetings with Mr Tusk, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Irish PM Leo Varadkar, and French president Emmanuel Macron.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

You’ve got to make decisions about how we get back our brand at being the best for all the issues in the local community not just best for some.”\u0026nbspTories hit by election candidate shortage with activists ‘demoralised’During the recording, Mr Scott can be seen standing next to a powerpoint presentation which displays photographs of bin collections and a council tax form, before switching to an image of a homeless person when he mentions “caring stuff”.In a 45-second clip issued on the day of the local elections earlier this year, Theresa May appeared to follow that message, highlighting bin collection services and the Tory councils having a “record of managing money wisely”.“Delivering those high-quality services, all whilst\u0026nbspkeeping council tax low,” the prime minister added in a video sent from CCHQ’s Twitter feed on 3 May.\u0026nbspSeizing on the recording from the training session at the Tories’ conference, Catherine West, a Labour MP, said it was an “astonishing admission”.“They are telling their campaigners not to mention issues related to caring for people in their communities because they know Labour is better in this area,” she said. “We have a governing party which has given up on caring for people in this country.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

It is universally acknowledged that British music is one of this country’s biggest success stories, with UK artists releasing a staggering one\u0026nbspin 8 albums bought anywhere in the world.For musicians – the protestors include Jarvis Cocker and members of The Chemical Brothers, Super Furry Animals, Mogwai and Pink Floyd, among others – “being in the EU” has played a major part.They point out that no less than 60 per cent of revenues paid to the UK come from the EU, fuelled by a free sharing of data which is now under threat, and that the astonishing vinyl revival is at risk from higher import fees.But, for musicians, it’s much bigger than that. Music is and must be “about embracing and respecting other cultures”, they say – while Brexit will, inevitably, see Britain “isolate ourselves”.“Our concern is that new musicians won’t have the privileges that we had,” says Mr Singh, whose catchy number-one single “Brimful of Asha” was a key soundtrack of the\u0026nbsplate 1990s.Older musicians have grim memories of needing special permission to “get into countries when there wasn’t free movement, but that was a long time ago”, he says.He explains: “Britain is used as a base for touring France and Germany, but artists need to be able to get equipment and people over to Europe and the fear is that will stop because it will be too expensive.”But, for Mr Singh, leaving the EU goes so much deeper than his love for music, because his opposition is an ethos, a state of mind. “Cornershop were anti-Brexit even before Brexit was here,” he says.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchGrowing up in Wolverhampton, memories were fresh of Enoch Powell’s racist “Rivers of Blood” speech\u0026nbspin 1968, which claimed\u0026nbspimmigration would lead to violence and did so much damage to race relations.It’s a controversial view, but Mr Singh insists racism was a “motivation” for some who voted for Brexit, but argues people were also angered by years of cuts – which means they will feel betrayed.“These people won’t be satisfied by what happens after Brexit, because there will be yet more cuts to services, the country will be hobbled by Brexit,” he warns.Here he also targets Jeremy Corbyn for “failing to provide leadership by opposing Brexit”, while echoing claims that EU immigration has lowered workers’ wages here.“Corbyn has gone down the same line and said a lot of the rot that the Conservatives put out – and even Ukip,” Mr Singh protests.“Coming out of the EU is not what’s best for workers and workers’ rights. I find it incredible that Labour doesn’t realise that.”Mr Singh will also be marching because, with a French wife, “we have woken up every morning consumed by Brexit since the referendum”.I’m a former soldier who voted for Brexit- but now I regret itCorbyn under fresh pressure to back a Final Say Brexit referendum10,000 young people to lead major demo calling for fresh Brexit voteWhy so many Tory MPs are privately keen on a Final Say referendumShe quickly applied for UK citizenship, which means she is “a lot more secure than others”, but millions of EU citizens here remain fearful about their future rights.“I wonder why many EU citizens even want to stay in the country when you think how badly they have treated,” the singer says. “It is pitiful that it has got to this.”But, with Theresa May still insisting there will be no Final Say referendum – and Mr Corbyn fighting Labour pressure to back one – can Saturday’s march really achieve its aim?“I think so,” he insists. “One year ago, people laughed at the idea of a People’s Vote happening, but, as the truth has come out, the rupee has dropped and people are understanding we must find out what the country feels now.“We now have much more information and people can take a better-informed view about whether we want to leave the EU or not.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hererivers of bloodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

During it practically\u0026nbspnothing would change for the UK – Britain would continue to implement all EU law, stay in the single market and customs union and under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\u0026nbspThe UK would however not be represented in EU institutions like the Parliament, Council, and Commission and would therefore have no say in drawing up the rules.“A further idea that has emerged – and it is an idea at this stage – is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months – and it would only be for a matter of months,” the Prime Minister told reporters on the summit’s doorstep.“But the point is that this is not expected to be used, because we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship in place by the end of December 2020.“I’m clear that it is possible to do that and that is what we are working for, and in those circumstances there would be no need for any proposal of this sort and I’m clear that I expect the implementation period to end at the end of December 2020.”Most trade experts and people in Brussels agree the current 21-month period will realistically not be enough time to negotiate a full free trade agreement between the UK and EU, and that an extension is inevitable. If the transition expires before a new trade deal was ready the UK would yet again face the prospect of a no-deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But she cannot let it distract her from securing a deal on BrexitClick to followIndy PoliticsThe row over universal credit could not have come at a worse time for\u0026nbspTheresa May. With most of Whitehall’s resources and almost all of Downing Street’s political capital focused on Brexit, No 10 is now also having to stave off growing backbench unrest about the government’s flagship welfare policy.The introduction of the new system has been dogged by delays and warnings about the impact on struggling families. Ministers have already made a series of changes and no one doubts that more will be needed. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the government “will make sure we get this benefit right”. People may ask why, six years after the change was approved by parliament, it has not done so already.Tory backbenchers are increasingly concerned about the policy and the impact it will have on their constituents. This is not a minor reform – the switch to universal credit will affect eight million working-age people. MPs are already being bombarded with tales of people forced into debt, destitution and, according to one Labour MP, prostitution\u0026nbspas they are transferred to the new system.Labour fails to force government to release universal credit papersPolitically, too, the fiasco is damaging for the Conservatives. If the next election is not until 2022, it is issues of public services and welfare that could prove pivotal, especially universal credit, which directly affects more than one in eight voters. The public bought into the idea of belt-tightening when it was needed to reduce the deficit. With the economy growing and Ms May having heralded the end of austerity, that argument no longer holds.The tales of hardship that accompany every debate on universal credit will trouble Tories who fear once again being seen as the nasty party, and fuel perceptions that Conservative modernisers worked so hard to dispel.The disastrous implementation of the policy also spectacularly undermines what will inevitably be one of the Tories’ main electoral arguments: that they are the party of competence and efficient management. The problem is not the concept of universal credit, which has cross-party support, but the implementation of it.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

The result is a policy pushed through on the cheap, without the proper funding and thought needed to adequately implement such a drastic change to the welfare system.

Universal credit was introduced long before she became prime minister. It is hard to believe that, if she could, Ms May would not quietly scrap it and be done.

With Tory backbenchers warning that almost 30 of them are prepared to vote against the government on the issue, any significant votes on universal credit\u0026nbspare likely to be pushed back until next summer at the earliest.

He said good progress had been made on the withdrawal agreement and on the future framework.Cabinet strongly supported the Prime Minister over the importance of maintaining the integrity of the union.Cabinet also agreed that we must be able to ensure that we cannot be kept in the backstop arrangement indefinitely.The PM said there will no doubt be challenging moments ahead, that is in the nature of negotiations.She said she is committed to ensuring a Brexit that delivers on the referendum results, safeguards jobs and security and which preserves our union.Before the Cabinet meeting, two ministers present at the pizza summit played down suggestions of rebellion against the Prime Minister.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told Sky News: No-one is planning on resigning.We are all doing our jobs and we are trying to get the best deal for this country, and that\u0027s it.Brexit news: The Irish border has been the biggest obstacle facing the UK (Image: )We are approaching the end of negotiations. This is going to be a difficult time, but the whole Cabinet is digging in to get the best deal for this country.And Mrs Leadsom said: The Prime Minister is doing a very, very complicated job and I\u0027m fully supporting her in getting that done.EU Council President Donald Tusk attempted to increase the pressure on Mrs May to come forward with new concrete proposals at the summit and claimed there were no grounds for optimism about the chances of a deal.As I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr Tusk told a Brussels press conference.However, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough is possible.EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday said that more time was needed to find an agreement to deliver an orderly UK withdrawal and keep the Irish border open.We will take this time, calmly and seriously, to find this global agreement in the next weeks, he said.Germany\u0027s Europe minister, Michael Roth, said Berlin\u0027s message to Mrs May was: Take responsibility and be constructive.

Their drop in profits has come largely due to an over-investment in diesel engines which are now being persecuted by the very EU who pertain to be helping them.East Midlands Ukip MEP Jonathan Bullock said this latest development was not the first time the EU had acted in such a way.He said: \u0026ldquoIn 2012 the European Investment Bank loaned Ford \u0026pound80million to develop a Transit factory in Turkey - Ford thus closed its plant in Southampton.\u0026ldquoThe EU is fundamentally hostile to the interests of British workers.\u0026ldquoWorse, as long as we are paying into the European Union, British taxpayers are subsidising the transfer of British jobs, be it to Turkey or Slovakia.MEPs and MPs have reacted furiously to the news (Image: )\u0026ldquoWe cannot leave this farce, soon enough.However, Dame Caroline Spelman, Conservative MP for Meriden and the West Midlands, who meets with JLR regularly, explained the Solihull plant\u0026rsquos temporary closure was to allow it to \u0026ldquoundertake wholesale change to prepare for electrification.She said: \u0026ldquoThe upgrade of the Solihull plant will mean it is at the forefront of electric and hybrid car production, which is where the future of car production lies.Jaguar Land Rover has been contacted for comment.

The gaps between the positions are significant and time is running out.Theresa May will travel to Brussels tomorrow to attend a crunch summit with EU leaders in what will be one of the final chances to secure a orce deal with the bloc.A solution to avoid customs checks and border infrastructure along the politically sensitive frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is the last major hurdle to overcome but there are still \u0026ldquosignificant gaps left to bridge, Mr Varadkar said.EU officials today warned Mrs May she must demonstrate progress has been made towards a consensus or an emergency summit planned for November would be cancelled.Brussels\u0026rsquo backstop proposals would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and much of the single market while a trade deal which includes a border solution is drawn up.But the British Government has dismissed this as unacceptable with Mrs May likening the plan to \u0026ldquocarving off part of the country.

Woman, 86, suffers heart attack after purse snatched from bag in sh...As many as 3.6 million older people in the UK live alone, more than two million of whom are 75-plus, and one in four older people views the television as their main form of companionship.Dame Esther said: The Silver Line receives thousands of calls from older people through the evening, especially on long winter nights when the TV is their only friend.They have paid the licence fee all their lives \u0026ndash this is the way the BBC can give something back.National Pensioners Convention general secretary Jan Shortt called on the Government to take the licence concession back in-house.Miss Shortt said: Ever since George Osborne forced the BBC to take over responsibility for the free TV licence, we have known that they would try and get rid of it.Dame Esther Rantzen campaigns for older people (Image: Jeff SpicerGetty )Frankly it\u0027s not the job of the broadcaster to administer or fund part of our wider welfare policy. That is a job for government and it needs to be returned to the most suitable department as a matter of urgency.Laura Alcock-Ferguson of the Campaign to End Loneliness, said: Television provides a great comfort for many lonely older people.It can give structure and routine and make you feel as though you\u0027re part of something. The prospect of that being taken away could have a devastating impact on older people experiencing loneliness.More than 4.46 million homes with older residents receive a free TV licence, saving them \u0026pound150.50 a year.But the BBC is reported to be preparing proposals on reforming the subsidy, which could include raising the age of eligibility and means-testing.Options could also include asking for voluntary payments and removing the subsidy from pensioners who live with younger family.The report by Frontier Economics, on behalf of the BBC, says by 2022 the cost to the corporation will be \u0026pound745million - more than double the \u0026pound365million paid by the Government in 2002.Former Labour business minister Ian Lucas yesterday urged Theresa May to halt any cuts. The Prime Minister said it was up to the BBC to take a decision about how they operate on this.The broadcaster\u0027s report says when the concession was introduced, it was justified based on evidence that older pensioner households were disproportionately concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution.It also says: Incomes, wealth and life expectancy of older people have improved significantly.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Secretary David Mundell could resignNorthern Ireland is granted special status in any EU deal.The DUP and Remain Tory MPs also threaten Mrs May’s survival.Brexit chief Dominic Raab flew to Brussels yesterday for last-ditch talks. We must secure a time-limit agreement for the temporary Customs Union — remaining in it by the next election would stop us from striking any meaningful trade deals outside the EU.Meanwhile, Tories threatening mutiny should consider what will happenthey try to oust the PM. It will spark a bloody leadership battle that will strengthen Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour.It could also lead to a General Election in which the Tories will likely be punished by an unforgiving public, irritated at being dragged to the polls yet again.This week the PM must present her solution to the Irish border and reiterate her commitment for a No Deal Brexit, in which our £billion cheque would be taken off the table.And the Tory party needs to stand firmly behind her — for now.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

They got neither.Both couples claimed other commitments but, given that they all took centre stage at Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and the Beckhams also made the cut for William and Kate’s big day, perhaps they felt this wasn’t A-list enough Instead, we had to make do with, among others, models Naomi Campbell, Cara ­Delevingne and Kate Moss, X Factor judges Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, and actresses Demi Moore and Liv Tyler.Some of whom uploaded gushing videos from the event and Instagram photos of their outfits with hashtag plugs for ­ious clothing brands.At a “royal” wedding  The notoriously traditional Queen Mother must be turning in her grave.There will be the modernisers within the palace walls who regard this as “progress” for a monarchy that, as they see it, must appeal to a younger generationit is to survive.But to my mind, it’s the complete opposite.The pomp, ceremony, tradition, duty and, most importantly, ­mystique of the royals is what sustains them.This wedding — between a “Princess” who performs no royal duties and her Jack of tequila trade — has shone a ­spotlight on the blindingly obvious threat that, once the dutul Queen and Prince Philip are no longer with us, the ­“modern” monarchy will continue to make ever decreasing circles until the taxpayer finally decides, “Hang on — they’re just like us” and the game will be up.With this #royalwedding where even the bride’s mother, left, Instagrammed a designer plug “for my amazing dress” that threat has just come one step closer.RITA ORA is promoting her new album Phoenix. “It’s my first global release of an album.I’m really excited to express my music to the world,” she says.But why the seemingly ­regular need to, er, express her breasts at the same time After all, Ed Sheeran has never posed in just his kecks and he’s sold  squillion records.ANGRY passengers on a flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul intervened to stop Home Office officials from deporting Somalian Yaqub Ahmed.“I know he’s scared,” protested one, before leading a chant of: “Take him off the plane, take him off the plane.”Though probably not as scared as the -year-old girl who was gang-raped in London by Ahmed and two of his equally unsavoury friends – the crime for which he was being deported before these witless do-gooders stepped in.Pitully, the officials capitulated and Ahmed is still in this country awaiting our next move.Meanwhile, as some of the passengers virtue-signalled their liberal credentials by posting footage of the showdown, perhaps they could now be identied and charged with obstructing the course of justice Or, at the very least, be asked to welcome the delightful Mr Ahmed into their own homes until such time as his removal can be rearranged Let’s seetheir liberalism extends to putting their own teenage daughters at risk.PIZZAS and pies must shrink to tackle obesity, claim new official guidelines from Public Health England.Sigh. Amazing, isn’t it, how millions of people manage to stay slim by eating healthily and doing moderate exercise while advocating the same mindset to their children Radical, I know, buta pizza is large, how about sharing it Or perhaps not buying it at all Or is a slice of personal responsibility too hard to swallow CHANNING Tatum and Jessie J are dating.We know this because they’ve been spotted ­laughing together at a mini-golf course.Ah yes, those heady, early months of dating when you’re presenting the best side of yourself and pretending you just love doing kooky stuff like ­hitting a ball into the clown’s mouth or paddling in pointless circles around the local ­boating lake.Then the eager-to-please phase passes and, before you know it, you’re watching ­separate TV shows in dferent parts of the house.

I fully support DD [David Davis] as interim leader, she added.Andrea Jenkyns agreed, telling ITVs Peston: It’s ludicrous that it’s two years on and we haven’t got a deal. Extending [the transition] just kicks it into the long grass.And John Redwood said her plans would be unacceptable, saying: I dont think MPs would vote for it.Nigel Farage added: This is another betrayal of Brexit... I dont think she can survive this.He speculated it could mean British taxpayers having to pay an extra £BILLION to the EU.But Tory Deputy Chairman James Cleverly played down the suggestion of extending the transition period - pointing out that it was only a proposal from the EU.He refused to rule it out, but said Michel Barnier put forward a proposal which our Prime Minister and negotiating team will think about.The PM also held separate meetings with Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, Emmanuel Macron and Irish PM Leo Varadkar today.But despite the high level talks, EU leaders said tonight that despite intensive negotiations there had not been enough progress between negotiators to come to a deal.They said that a November summit was off the cards for now, but stood ready to hold a December one in the hope that a deal could be sealed there instead.No had already given up any hope of forging a orce deal at the summit before it even started.The Brexiteer called the EU “a gravy train soaking us dry”.It had been billed as the “moment of truth” for an agreement before last weekend’s big row.Mrs May also asked the leaders to show “courage” to help her break the impasse.And despite talks stalling over Ireland yet again when a deal brokered by bureaucrats collapsed on Sunday, she also insisted an agreement was possible and appealed for them to come up with “creative” ways to help her.Mrs May told the leaders: We have shown we can do dficult deals together constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome.The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.After she delivered the pitch, Mrs May was then asked to leave the summit room so her fellow national could deliberate over her words with dinner.The PM ed to the UK Representative to the EU’s official residence in Brussels for dinner alone with her aides.Under Mr Barnier’s proposal to extend the transition period, Mrs May must inagree to keep the whole of the UK in an indefinite customs union as a backstop to keep the Irish border opentrade talks to deliver another solution fail.But Mrs May has already ruled that out, and Cabinet ministers have demanded a legally binding mechanism to ensure any backstop is only temporary.Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar gave his backing to the extension as one way of breaking the Irish border deadlock, but only under Mr Barnier’s conditions.Mr Varadkar said: Any extension to the transition period couldnt be a substitute for the backstop.We would still need to have that, but perhaps it would allow people to have greater confidence that it would never need to be invoked.”Some EU leaders began to express open doubts that Mrs May will ever be able to strike a deal with them because of Tory party turmoil over Brexit.Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaitė: We do not know what they want, they do not know themselves what they really want - thats the problem.“If you have on the other side of the table a negotiator who has no strong mandate, its very dficult to negotiate.”Ms Grybauskaitė, dubbed her country’s own ‘Iron Lady’ because of her black belt in karate, added: “The Brits must decide finally want they want, and rally behind the Prime Minister and not split, not battling, to have a joint opinion and joint stance.”But other EU leaders were more optimistic, including France’s Emmanuel Macron who said the EU would “find deals” to secure an orderly Brexit.The French president last night emerged as a key figure of support for Mrs May to break the Ireland impasse, having lead the way in torpedoing her trade deal proposals at a summit in Salzburg last month.Mr Macron was one of four EU leaders that Mrs May held one-to-one meetings with in Brussels ahead of the summit’s start.Another pivotal player, Germany’s Angela Merkel, was also supportive, saying: “We want good relations with Britain.“We would have been happythe exit deal was ready. Instead, we are  percent there.But I will tackle the issues in good spirit and try everything to find an agreement.”It also emerged tonight that Mrs May has invited  chief executives to take part in a conference call on Friday to brief them on the status of Brexit negotiations.The invitations, which were sent out today, are part of efforts by Downing Street to build a closer relationship with business.And in a blow to the PM, French officials today published a paper stating that in a No Deal scenario, British visitors to France would in principle need a visa to enter the country, and would be considered illegal immigrantsthey failed to apply for one.The document also revealed that French ministers are planning to implement new border checks the day after Brexitthe two sides fail to agree a deal.Its the first time a major European country has publicly announced plans for how it would cope with a No Deal outcome.On a crucial day in the Brexit process:At the start of todays summit, some leaders expressed optimism about the chances of a deal - Dutch PM Mark Rutte said: Im cautiously optimistic that over the coming weeks Michel Barnier and the negotiating team in the UK will come to conclusions.Angela Merkel claimed a deal was  per cent done, adding: I’m approaching this with the spirit of always trying to do everything to find an agreement.But Lithuanias president Dalia Grybauskaite said the UK had yet to agree its own negotiating position.She said Britain needs to rally behind the Prime Minister all together and not split - to have a joint opinion and joint stance.And chief negotiator Michel Barnier added: We are not there yet. Brexit must be orderly for everyone and for all the issues, including on the island of Ireland.So we need time, we need much more time, and we will continue to work in the next weeks calmly and patiently.Belgiums Charles Michel said: We are concerned because we see it is dficult in the British Parliament to have the same views on the future of the relationship between the EU and UK.The EU meeting which started today was previously earmarked as the moment when leaders would sign off an a withdrawal agreement.But talks broke down over the weekend after the EU insisted on a border backstop which could carve off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Mrs May told a Cabinet meeting yesterday that she wont accept any deal which which breaks up the Union - or which keeps Britain tied to the EU customs union permanently.And speaking to MPs in the Commons today, the PM said: We continue to work for a good deal with the European Union - a deal that delivers on the Brexit vote but also a deal that protects jobs and livelihoods and crucially that protects the precious Union of the United Kingdom.We will not accept any proposals which would effectively break up the United Kingdom.She accused Jeremy Corbyn of preparing to betray voters by laying the ground for a second referendum on Brexit.Mrs May also rejected the Labour leaders claim that her Chequers proposals are dead after she failed to mention them by name in two recent speeches.Today Michael Gove suggested that a deal might not be signed until December - just three months before we officially quit the EU.He told a Commons committee: It might be the case - we’ve seen how European negotiations work - that progress is made at October council, progress is made at the November council, and it is even as late as the December council before a deal is done.Obviously, everyone wants the deal to be done earlier.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed one of the biggest threats to Brexit is Tory MPs like Boris Johnson who refuse to back Mrs Mays approach.He told the Daily Mail: Boris is a backbencher so he is free to say exactly as he thinks.But what I would say to Boris is be careful because there is a real danger thatall of us Conservative MPs do not stand behind the Prime Minister at a moment like this, the danger is that Brexit will be derailed altogether.I am sure that this is last thing Boris wants.The pro-EU veterans made a direct appeal to politicians across the EU, asking them to back calls for a second referendum.They wrote a joint opinion piece which appeared today in a number of European newspapers.The trio said: Our domestic debate is far from over and, even at this late hour, many of us are continuing to make the case that the British public need to make the final decision once we are in possession of all the relevant facts.So we ask our European partners to be ready to give us the space and time,necessary, to make such a final decision.They accused Brexiteers of being cynical pessimists who want to get a flimsy exit deal that they would later tear up in order to impose deregulation and tax cuts.The ex-PM and two former deputies have been blasted by Brexit-backing MPs who say they are undermining Britains negotiating position."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442088992.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits set for 230 a year pension boost and more money in your pocket as inflation drops","story":"Pensioners will see a boost of almost £ a week from next April, and hard-working families will start to feel an ease to the cost of living squeeze.Inflation fell to . per cent from . per cent last month, as food and drink cost less.It means hard-up Brits will have more money in their pockets as they gear up for Christmas shopping.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: Food was the main downward pull on inflation as last years September price rises failed to reappear, while ferry prices dropped after their surprisingly high summer peak.However, it wasnt all one-way traffic with energy suppliers pushing up their prices.And yesterday wages were shown to be rising by the fastest pace in nearly a decade -

I speak for many more of my generation than you might think. I was born in , when my country was fighting for its le against Nazi Germany and it was not clear that we would win. My father Harry was in the RAF in the Middle East. My Uncle Bob was a tail gunner in Lancasters over occupied Europe.My Uncle Jack, a Guardsman, had been invalided off the beaches at Dunkirk. Even my youthful Auntie Barbara was in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. This was total war – the Americans fighting and dying with us, for our freedom. At home it was all wartime austerity. Food and clothes were rationed. Travel was suspended. I ask you to remember because so many have either forgotten or never known the cataclysmic reality of Europe at war with itself. Remember the Blitz on London and Hull. Remember Sheffield, Coventry, Plymouth, Liverpool, Bath and York. Remember, Auschwitz, Treblinka, and the other death camps where millions of Jews were exterminated. Remember El Alamein, Tobruk, Normandy and all the battlegrounds where people gave their lives to free us from Hitler.Remember all these things and consider thoughtfully what must be done to ensure that these horrors never happen again.  The EU brought peace, trade, co-operation and freedom to travel where there had been enmity, rivalry and refugees. It is not perfect, made up of all the flaws of the people of an old, culturally and racially erse continent that historically has more often been at war than at peace. But it is nothing short of a miracle that they found the wisdom to get together in their common interest. I do not care what Theresa May brings back from Brussels, just so long as it keeps us good friends and partners with the rest of Europe. I want the peace that my father’s generation fought for to be preserved in perpetuity, for my children, and generations to come. So, when Mrs May s with her Brexit package, I look to the politicians – including those Labour MPs who have the country’s real interests at heart – to support her in the hour of the nation’s need. At this critical time it is more important to vote for a new relationship with Europe than to blindly follow the elusive dream of Jeremy Corbyn in No. The crunch is coming and it will reveal the true patriots. Because of the war I did not see my father until I was three years old. But I was lucky. At least Sgt Routledge came home. So many others didn’t.

The Government defeated an attempt by Labour to force ministers to publish its analysis of the impact of the benefits shake-up. Labour described Universal Creditas a vehicle for cuts, but failed in their efforts to push ministers into releasing the documents, by  votes to , majority . Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said UC had been beset with flaws in its design and delivery and was causing immense hardship.  Reacting to the vote, Ms Greenwood added in a statement: The Tories have voted to shamefully cover up the impact that Universal Credit is having on families and people who most need our support. But Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey insisted the Government had taken a mature approach to the roll-out and said it would continue. Opening an Opposition Day debate in the Commons, Ms Greenwood said: Universal Credit, the Governments flagship social security programme, has been beset with flaws in its design and delivery. Its causing immense hardship for many people wherever it is rolled out. It is hard to believe now, but UC was designed to lt people out of poverty and smooth the transition into work to ensure that it always pays. The reality is that UC is a vehicle for cuts.  Ms Greenwood said confusion about the transfer to UC was causing families real concern and that they deserve answers. Labours motion was the latest proposed use of an arcane parliamentary procedure to make the vote binding on the Government by issuing a humble address to the Queen asking her to require ministers to comply. It called for any briefing papers or analysis provided to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions since January   on the impact of the roll-out of Universal Crediton recipients and household income and on benefit debts to be laid before Parliament. Ms McVey insisted the roll-out of Universal Credit would continue, but said she would ensure the Government get it right. We will make sure we get this benefit right. You know for why  Because the genuine concerns of the people on our backbenches want to get it right. She received backing from Tory Heidi Allen , who said she and fellow backbenchers believed the Secretary of State is listening to what needs to change with Universal Credit. She said that makes a mockery of the motion, and told MPs that there is not a single person, myself included, who will vote for the motion. Ms McVey told the Commons that disabled households would be pound better off through Universal Credit, as she defended the Governments approach. She said: Around one million disabled households will receive on average around pound more per month through Universal Credit, andwe were to follow the advice of the party opposite those one million disabled households would be pound worse off. Thats what the opposition are asking for.

North Yorkshire councillors overwhelmingly blocked a Labour motion to oppose the “fundamentally wrong” cut to free transport for children with special educational needs and disabilities . After the vote, councillors gorged on pavlova, roast beef, salmon and a DOZEN dferent cheeses. The council’s now reviewing its spending, which one Labour councillor has slammed. “In these times of austerity foisted upon us by this out of touch and uncaring government, it is imperative that every opportunity to ensure rate payers cash is ploughed back into the savaged front line services,” raged Cllr Tony Randerson. “Not being a cheese eater, I haven’t noticed all these dferent types of cheeses but I have to say I’m rather surprised at the cost of this meal. “I for one will not be partaking in this buffet any longer and will instruct the authority of my position in order that they do not waste food.” The meal, unearthed via the Freedom of Information Act, followed a February meeting where council tax was “reluctantly” hiked up.  Swingeing cuts in the region have so far resulted in libraries closing, buses axed and street lights switched off. At the meeting, North Yorkshire’s Deputy Leader, Conservative Gareth Dadd, warned: “The financial challenges will last well into the next decade.” However analysis of the costs revealed over pound was spent per councillor present on the meal - and some taxpayer’s found the cost hard to swallow. “So they can sit around eating cake and roast beef, but we have to walk home in the dark ” fumed North Yorkshire resident James Wainwright. “We are all in this together - even councillors - so why do they need a dozen cheeses  “Could they not just bring a packed lunch or go get a toastie down the pub ”  In total, pound,. was spent on feeding the  councillors - although almost a dozen didn’t even attend the meeting, The menu at Northallerton’s County Hall included:Seared Chicken Breast with Lemon  herbs Poached Salmon with Lemon  dill mayonnaise Roast British beef and roast ham Greek saladAnd in a further blow to Yorkshire residents, it emerged the council had previously included a smoked Lancashire on the cheese board. “It is asthe War of the Roses never happened!” added James. Over  councillors blocked a motion to tabled by Labour’s Eric Broadbent to stop transport being cut, despite a passionate plea to find savings where. “We believe that the changes proposed to transport for children with SEND are fundamentally wrong,” he said. “Whilst we understand that the Council need to make savings, we believe that this area provides a valuable service to those who are amongst the most vulnerable in society and it is the Council’s duty to exhaust all other areas before removing free transport for young people with SEND. “It is therefore proposed that the implementation of the cut is removed and the funding of the saving gap met from Reserves until such time as more acceptable proposals are developed.” To date, over poundm has had to be shaved from the council’s books. County Councillor Carl Les, North Yorkshire County Council’s Leader, stated: “Our full council meets four times a year and that is the only time that councillors are provided with lunch.

The -year-old left the party in Sydneys northern beaches and hitched a lt, which was not uncommon as there was little public transport in the area. Just after midnight, her then boyfriend, Steven Norris, saw her get into a beige  van with no windows in the back. It was the last time any of Trudie Adams loved ones saw her. When she didnthome from the party, her family reported her missing.  Five days after her daughters disappearance, Trudies mum Connie received a haunting phone call from a mystery male. The voice said, Trudie is dead. You will find her about half way up Mona Vale Road. It was an accident. An identical phone call was made to Mona Vale police. Police searched the area but Trudie was never found. Despite four investigations and a coroner stating that the teen probably died of misadventure followed by a cover up, authorities are still mystied by her disappearance. The mystery of Trudie Adams’ disappearance is now the focus of ABCs latest true crime podcast Unravel , which examines how the case has remained unsolved for  yearsIts now suspected by some that police corruption that might have played a part in the case. Its never about the actual incidents themselves, its about the cover-up, a former police official said in the podcast.In the months after Trudie’s disappearance, a number of young women came forward to report sexual assaults and attempted abductions in the Mona Vale area.The women’s accounts took place over a period beginning in , and they reported being blindfolded, handcuffed, held at gunpoint and sexually assaulted. The Unravel podcast states that: The rapes were of such maniacal brutality that even now the police have refused to reveal details on or off the record.  According to a report from New South Wales police in , detectives believed something similar may have happened to Trudie. It is our belief she was kidnapped by two males and murdered, Detective Superintendent Beresford said at the time. As a result of our inquiries, we believe Trudies abduction was sexually-motivated. Furthermore, we suspect there are more victims of these two sexual predators who have not previously come forward to police. Police offered a , reward for information that would solve the case, to no avail. Tragically, Trudie’s mother Connie died  years after her daughter’s disappearance without ever finding out what happened to her. At the  inquest, Trudies father said his we had died of a broken heart.Unravels investigative journalists Ruby Jones and Nick Mercer hope they might find some answers for Trudies family and friends.

Ministry of Defence officials have been ordered to investigate how the shocking rate of birth abnormalities among nuclear veteran children -  times higher than the normal population - could be researched. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is campaigning for the survivors to get a medal, said: “This is a fantastic development. Veterans’ biggest worry is the health of their children, an estimated , of whom live with a shockingly high rate of illness and disability which has never been explained. “The battle now is to ensure that the MoD looks at these problems properly rather than sweep them under the scientic carpet.”  It is the first time in  years of campaigning that a government has considered examining the genetic legacy of Britain’s nuclear bomb tests, which took place in Australia and the South Pacic between  and . Veteran John Ward, , was an RAF typist at Christmas Island in  for five nuclear experiments. He has had bladder cancer, his son Mark has had kidney cancer, and he describes daughter Denise as “a medical mess”. She has problems with her teeth, pancreas, reproductive system, and calcium growths. John, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, said: “This is encouraging news and a massive improvement on the MoD’s long-held position of obfuscation and denial. Us old soldiers are relying on Mr Williamson to keep his word.” The Defence Secretary also appears to have slapped down blundering civil servants trying to block a medal. We revealed in August that officials had insisted a gong might depend on proof they were irradiated. But such proof is held by the MoD, which admits its records are patchy and filled with mistakes.  Now in a letter to Mr Watson, veterans minister the Earl Howe has apologised for “the awkward language” and said it was “never the intention” to snub those who served at the tests, many of whom were on National Service. He went on to say the veterans claim “a real dference in rates of miscarriage and congenital defects in their children and grandchildren compared with others” but there were “challenges to rigorous evaluation of such questions”. Although two studies in  found evidence of genetic damage, birth defects and  times the normal rate of infant mortality among veterans’ children, not every miscarriage or abnormality used to be recorded as they are today. He said: “My officials have requested up to date expert advice on possible approaches which is presently awaited.” The minister added the veterans’ case was similar to that for the heroes of the Arctic Convoys, who finally won a medal in .

I don’t want to freak her out.” Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of Eucalyptus, he encouraged the royal visitors to smell it. “Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush ” asked the Duke. “Yes, but we can’t eat it in the same way,” replied Greg, explaining how oils from the plant are used to flavour marinades, fish dishes and even ice cream.  The couple was presented with Charcoal Lane aprons for the “touch, taste and smell” experience, but did not wear them. Speaking ahead of the royal visit, Greg said: “We are here to support young Aboriginal people into the workforce, with a view that when they leave this place, there is going to be long-term employment for them,” he said. “I’m not going to turn everyone that comes here into a chef, butthey leave here with a work ethic, it’s a win for us.” Charcoal Lane currently employs  young people for  hours a week as they work towards a Certicate  in hospitality. “A lot of them come from backgrounds where nobody has worked, so this is very important for them,” said Greg.  Programme Manager Troy Crellin said that in  years, the organisation had helped some  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders into work. The Duke and Duchess’s visit to the restaurant began after they admired a mural outside created by Gunnai and Waradgerie man Robert Young to honour the building and the area’s indigenous heritage. He told Harry and Meghan how his Celebration Dreaming artwork references Aboriginal identity, connections and culture in inner Melbourne Fitzroy. Before heading into the kitchen, they received a Welcome to Country delivered by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Colin Hunter. Mission Australia CEO, James Toomey said: “It was such a fantastic and humbling surprise to hear that Mission Australia’s restaurant, Charcoal Lane was chosen to welcome The Duke and Duchess for a tour, hands-on cooking session and lunch. It is a once in a letime opportunity for the students to meet Their Royal Highnesses. Not too many young people can say they’ve met and served royalty! “At Charcoal Lane, we are passionate about celebrating Aboriginal history and providing students with a culturally safe space to express their inidual identities and overcome any challenges they may face on their journey to employment. Our program not only provides training and real work for young locals, but also fosters a sense of cultural and community pride which we are proud to have shared with Their Royal Highnesses. “We also encourage locals and visitors to Melbourne to make a reservation at Charcoal Lane – there are not many places you can say you ate the same meal as the royal couple while also making a social dference.” FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL TOUR THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT - CLICK HERE The Duke and Duchess are currently touring Australia for the rest of this week, spending much of their time in Sydney.

Ashleigh, mum of Edie Molyneux, posted the devastating image on Facebook in order to raise awareness of the condition.Edie, four, is battling Dfuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma , the Liverpool Echo reports.This is an aggressive, and ultimately fatal growth at the base of her brain. The tumour’s location in the centre of the brain means it cannot be surgically removed. And in the UK, chemotherapy is not an option because the levels needed to treat this tumour would poison the rest of the body. So little Edie has to travel all over the world with her family to receive treatment.Ashleighs post, on The Spider-Ede Appeal Facebook page, shows her crying in the foreground as her little girl lies on a hospital bed behind her, hooked to a ventilator. The status also told followers that Edie was doing amazing just yesterday before becoming limp and unresponsive.Mum-of-three, Ashleigh, from Tranmere , said: A picture speaks a thousand words.I have debated putting this photo up. Not because of how I look, that is so far from my concerns. But for fear people will shy away from seeing the real pain.  Yesterday Edie was doing AMAZING, almost off ventilation and taking so many breaths for herself. All of a sudden in the afternoon she started to breathe irregularly, we alerted the medics. The ventilator was turned up and she was given a check over. She had become limp and unresponsive. The doctors took her for a CT scan, the initial thought was that there may be a bleed on the brain. I never thought I’d say “unfortunately there is no bleed on the brain. The only visible culprit is the Tumour.

Explaining why she decided to post the emotional photograph, Ashley said she wanted people to see the hurt the illness causes.  She said: So why did I take this photo  We need you to see the reality of this, the raw hurt it causes. On the exterior we know we look strong. But when nobody is looking, sometimes not even our family, this is the time our worries creep in and we crumble. All of the questions what  why  If  Looking back at the photo is so strange with the “happy” birthday decorations in the background. Just another reminder of how quickly things can change. Edie turned four earlier this week and her family and friends celebrated the exciting day with balloons and her favourite movies. In a post on Facebook Edies family said they were having a day of positivity to celebrate after a fundraising ball was held in her honour at the Hillbark Hotel in West Kirkby. The status was also accompanied by a picture of Edie in hospital with a Feliz Cumpleanos banner hung above her bed. It said: Today we will be filling the day with Edie’s favourites.

Thank you all for your wonderful love-filled messages, we have showered her with love and will do all day.

The fact is, its hard to get people to care about politics. It can be confusing and hard to know what to believe, so some people just switch off. Something lots of us do care about is celebrity break ups and people in the US have come up with a genius way of tapping into that to encourage voter registrations. By using clickbait news stories or sensational headlines about celebrities, social media users are fooling people into visiting vote.org in the hope that theyll register for the upcoming midterm elections - genius.  Some brilliant examples include: Wow I can’t believe this is why Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson split up Someone  posted the link with: omg i can’t believe this is the REAL reason kanye is in Uganda. Another tricked people with this: GUYS ONE DIRECTION IS GETTING BACK TOGETHER!!!!! Its a really smart way of getting people to the website where they can register to vote.However, using deception on social media is controversial, more so since Facebook was accused of allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest the details of its users for Trumps presidential campaigning in .This trend appears to have originated from a tweet by writer Ashlee Marie Preston, who used the link in a post about Kim Kardashian orcing Kanye.She wrote: Welp...it’s official...Kim Kardashian finally decided to orce Kanye West... The link has been clicked on more than  million times, which is no insignicant number when it comes to votes. Whether or not those two million people actually registered or not is unknown, but it proves that this kind of tactic could potentially work.  Despite its effectiveness in getting people to click through to the vote.org website, peoples opinions are ided on the technique. Some thought the idea was awesome, with one writing that its a sneaky and ingenious idea. Others thought it was annoying and unfair. Several people commented to say that the tactic actually worked on them. Maybe well have to try something similar in the UK...

Turkish authorities who are looking for the dissident and US resident are facing the possibility that his body may never be found. Mr Khashoggi was last seen inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul more than two weeks ago. It is claimed he was butchered alive and decapitated by a -member hit squad that included an autopsy expert who once studied in Glasgow.  A source told Sky News that one line of inquiry is that a very fast-acting chemical acid was used to dissolve the journalists body parts after he was murdered. The theory emerged as Mr Khashoggis chilling final column was published by the Washington Post. His column warned that Middle Eastern governments have free rein to silence the media, and it came after a gruesome account in Turkeys Yeni Safak newspaper claimed that Saudi officials cut off his fingers and then decapitated him inside the consulate while his fiancee waited outside.  The Washington Post said it received Mr Khashoggis column from his assistant a day after he was reported missing. Titled Jamal Khashoggi: What the Arab world needs most is free expression, the column condemns the crackdown on journalists by Arab governments and the failure of the international community to respond. Mr Khashoggi cited his friend and fellow Saudi writer, Saleh al-Shehi, who was jailed for five years after criticising the Saudi establishment, and the Egyptian governments seizure of the entire print run of the al-Masry al Youm newspaper.  Mr Khashoggi, last seen on October , wrote: These actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community. Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence. As a result, Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate. The column included a note from Karen Attiah, the Posts global opinions editor, who said she received the column from Khashoggi’s translator and assistant the day after he was reported missing in Istanbul. She wrote: The Post held off publishing it because we hoped Jamal would come back to us so that he and I could edit it together.  Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen. This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post. Ms Attiah praised Mr Khashoggi for his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world, adding: A freedom he apparently gave his le for. The Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has denied any involvement in Mr Khashoggis disappearance. Turkish sources have told Reuters that investigators have an audio recording indicating Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate. On Thursday, Turkish crime scene investigators left the consulate after searching the premises and consular vehicles, a witness told Reuters. Authorities have also searched the Saudi consuls residence, where it is alleged the journalists remains were taken to. US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he did not want to abandon ally Saudi Arabia over Mr Khashoggis disappearance. He has asked for audio recordings Turkish sources say indicate the journalist was killed by Saudi agents, and he plans to meet on Thursday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who visited Saudi Arabia and Turkey earlier this week.

Once inside, he is said to have been tortured by the squad - allegedly including a Dr Death and a man with ties to the Saudi Crown Prince. He had his fingers brutally torn off as his killers spent seven minutes murdering him and dismembering his body, media reports claim. Chilling audio footage, taken that day, reportedly captures Saudi Arabias Consul General telling the suspects to do this outside. According to Yeni Safak , a strongly pro-government newspaper, Mohammed al-Otaibi adds: Youre going to get me in trouble.In response, one of the Saudi suspects allegedly replies: Shut upyou want to live when youtoArabia. Today, it emerged Mr al-Otaibi has been relieved of his post, according to an official statement carried by the Sabq newspaper. He will be investigated, although the Saudi online newspaper did not give details of the violations he is being investigated for. Turkish officials say they believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered and his body removed - an allegation the Saudis have strongly denied. The recording allegedly capturing the well-liked journalist being tortured and butchered alive has not been released to the public. But Sky News reports that a very well placed source says the Consul General and Mr Khashoggi can be heard speaking in audio footage.After this, there was a beating, the source claimed, adding that the footage later revealed the reporter was drugged and killed. The killing is said to have taken seven agonising minutes.We earlier reported how members of the hit squad reportedly listened to music through earphones as they dismembered their victim. A Turkish source, who has allegedly listened to an audio clip of the incident, told Middle East Eye : They had come to kill him. It was claimed that Mr Khashoggi was dragged from the Consul Generals office into his study next door, where he was dumped on a table. Loud screams could then be heard - which only stopped when he was injected with an unknown substance, according to the source. Moments later, his body was allegedly cut up - while he was still alive. Forensic evidence expert Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, dubbed Dr Death, has been identied by Turkey as a suspect in the killing. The source told MEE that Tubaigy listened to music via earphones as he cut up the reporters body while he was still breathing. He allegedly advised his accomplices to do the same. When I do this job, I listen to music. You should do [that] too, Tubaigy could be heard saying in the recording, the source said. According to Yeni Safak, Mr Khashoggi was told to shut up at one point during his ordeal, which also allegedly saw his head cut.  Today, another suspect in the Turkish police probe into the case was confirmed as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a Saudi diplomat. It is thought Mutreb may have worked as a bodyguard for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, whom he travelled extensively with.He used to work as a diplomat at the Saudi Embassy in London, according to the New York Times , which says several other suspects have been linked by witnesses and records to Bin Salmans security detail.The newspaper states that at least nine of the suspects worked for the Saudi security services, military or other government ministries. It is alleged they flew out the same day as the killing, and brought a bone saw with them for the purpose of cutting up Mr Khashoggis body. Records allegedly show that two private jets chartered by a Saudi firm arrived and departed from Istanbul on October .  Mr Khashoggi has so far been missing for  days. Turkish officials have said they have recorded evidence that he was assassinated by the hit squad, who they claim flew in via private jet. But the Saudis have strongly denied the allegations, insisting that Mr Khashoggi left the consulate safely on the day he was last seen. Mr Khashoggi is a US resident and Washington Post columnist who was critical of the Saudi government, calling for reforms. He had worked at the Saudi embassies in Washington, US, and London, and was well-liked by both fellow journalists and diplomats. He was described by one as a warm and funny man.According to Dexter Filkins, writing for The New Yorker , he was also loyal to his principles and refused to compromise his values. This prompted the Saudi government, in , to silence him, claims Dexter, adding that Mr Khashoggi fled to the US last year. In a move made after Bin Salman became Saudi Arabias Crown Prince, the respected journalist relocated to Virginia.There, he penned Washington Post columns and became a prominent critic of Bin Salman, the New York Times reports.He had visited the Saudi consulate to obtain marriage documents that would enable him to wed his Turkish fianceacutee. He was caught on CCTV footage arriving at the building, but his fianceacutee, who waited outside, said he never re-appeared.Reports have claimed Saudi officials are preparing a report saying he was killed during an attempt to bundle him out of the consulate.US President Donald Trump earlier sensationally gave the country the benefit of the doubt in Mr Khashoggis disappearance. US lawmakers have pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership, while Western pressure has mounted on Riyadh to provide answers. In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mr Trump saidSaudi Arabia knew what happened in the disappearance, that would be bad. I think we have to find out what happened first, he said yesterday. Speaking to reporters, he also drew comparisons with the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court scandal, adding: Here we go again with, you know, youre guilty until proven innocent. I dont like that. Mr Trump had earlier posted a Tweet saying that Bin Salman denied knowing what happened in the Saudi consulate. Last Saturday, a Turkish newspaper reported that recordings made on Mr Khashoggis Apple Watch - had been uncovered by investigators.  These recordings allegedly indicated he was tortured and killed, but the report in the Sabah daily could not immediately be veried. “The moments when Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered were recorded in the Apple Watch’s memory,” the paper said. It added that the watch had synched with the journalists iPhone, which his fiancee was carrying outside the consulate. However, technology experts have said it is highly unlikely the watch could have recorded actions inside the embassy and uploaded them to an iCloud account. Mr Khashoggis disappearance has provoked an international outcry against Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter.  More media and business executives have pulled out of a planned investment conference there this month. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his G counterparts have said they are very troubled by the case, and have insisted those responsible must be held to account. In an earlier statement, the G foreign ministers said: We, the G foreign ministers, of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, affirm our commitment to defending freedom of expression and protection of a free press. We remain very troubled by the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Those bearing responsibility for his disappearance must be held to account. We encourage Turkish-Saudi collaboration and look forward to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducting a thorough, credible, transparent, and prompt investigation, as announced. Mr Hunt had previously said that questions remain about the case that only Saudi Arabia can answer.  On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said Britain expected the Saudi government to provide a detailed response to questions over Mr Khashoggis disappearance. “We expect the Saudi government to provide a complete and detailed response,” the spokesman told reporters. Meanwhile, members of Mr Khashoggis family called for an investigation in a heartbreaking statement released on Monday. We are sadly and anxiously following the conflicting news regarding the fate of our father after losing contact with him two weeks ago, they said. The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death.

I thought it was a good performance, especially in the first half.“It didn’t feel like a - defeat, so it was a bit disappointing coming off with that scoreline but it was good to get the goal at the end.”The former Partick Thistle and Wigan centre-half has been pleased with his own progress in the blue of Scotland lately after picking up his third cap.He hopes that, alongside defensive partner McKenna, there are many more to come in the months and years ahead as Alex McLeish’s side look to get their Nations League campaign back on track as they travel to Albania and Israel come to Hampden next month.“In my first two caps I think I played very well and again last night, apart from near the end where I gave the ball away and it led to a goal, I thought I had a solid performance.“I’m taking everything in my stride, trying to keep learning and, hopefully, building on it. Scott’s a talented player and it’s good to see that kind of talent coming through the Scotland ranks. We work well as a partnership and we work well with each other so, hopefully, that can grow.“With the facilities, the coaching staff and the players around you at Celtic and with Scotland you’re always going to kick on as long as you put the work in, which I’m doing.

I never wanted anyone to feel like that coming into my shop.“I say we aren’t a beauty salon, we are a beauty shop – just like a barber shop vibe.“The competition in this industry is crazy but we have clients coming from far and wide including Fe and Blairgowrie, so we must be doing something right.”Eyelashes and brows aren’t the only things Kash hopes to offer in the future, she is also halfway through her tattoo apprenticeship and is looking to offer her skills when it is complete.She also sells her art in the shop and does commissions for tattoo artwork.Although Kash admits it is a   job running your own business she says anyone wanting to follow a similar path should “just do it”.She added: “If you want something go for it, but do your research first.“I am so happy with Dizzys and know my mum would be so proud of it too.”The hottest new treatment at Dizzys is a Dermaplaning facial carried out by Erin Abbott.The facial uses a sterile surgical scalpel to shave the surface of the skin to reduce excess dead skin and peach fuzz hairs.The tool is held at a -degree angle and is brushed along the skin to remove the hair and skin cells leaving your skin baby soft.I tried it out myself and wow, what a dference it has made.The procedure was pain free and a face mask after gave me  minutes of relaxing bliss.The treatment promises to make your make up sit flawlessly and I can’t wait to put a full face on to see the dference.Erin said: “All of our clients have had glowing feedback and it is great giving them the confidence of new skin.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc0a146988b3-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people hoping to follow in murrays footsteps","story":"Andy Murray was once a regular on the courts of Perth Lawn Tennis Club, the oldest tennis club in the world – and now two local youngsters are aiming to follow in his footsteps.Winning Wimbledon may be a long way away for Alexander English and Thomas Dixon but they have started off their careers very well.Alexander is the Scottish No  in the  and under age group, he has played for Scotland and is part of the national training programme in Stirling.The -year-old Strathallan pupil has a big date coming up in Nottingham.He will head south on the back of a lot of good performances, including winning his club’s U  singles and doubles titles, the latter with Fraser Ewan.The Kinnoull Primary pupil is also a Perth Lawn Tennis Club member who practices with the national squad in Stirling.The -year-old came second in the Scottish nine and under championships but he triumphed in the Tayside Open  and under event and in the Perth club’s  and under competition.Both lads are the recipients of a £ grant from Perth and Kinross Sports Council.For many years, the council has given financial aid to many sportsmen and women, including those who have gone on to win Olympic and Commonwealth medals."},{"url":null,"title":"fixture change gives dundee united new tannadice midweek date","story":"Dundee United have been given a midweek date after a fixture change.The Tangerines were due to face Alloa at Tannadice in the Championship on Saturday November .This match has now been moved to Tuesday  November at .pm due to a clash with the visitors# Irn-Bru Cup trip to Edinburgh City."},{"url":null,"title":"sunderland target glen kamara could be bound for euros after scoring first finland goal","story":"Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara could be on his way to the next Euros after helping Finland to another impressive victory.Kamara’s last-minute goal on Monday night – his first for his country – clinched a -

For the first time in a while, there was a spark and energy about the team that suggests they have the quality to mount a strong and successful promotion challenge.Having suggested that, through no fault of Neilson or his players, this was maybe not the best game on which to judge them.While United’s play for most of the proceedings was excellent, there is no doubt in Thistle they were facing a beleaguered outfit that looks to still be coming to terms with a relegation.Two games against the Tangerines this season have seen them well-beaten and fortunate the margin of their defeats were not considerably greater. They are in the process of finding a new manager to replace Alan Archibald and it’s clear the man who comes in has a very big job on his hands.As the old adage goes, however, Neilson and his players could only beat what was put in front of them and in his first game in charge victory was achieved in some style.And aspects of the performance mean Arabs do have good reason to feel optimistic about their team’s prospects.After just a few days working with the new boss, Saturday saw a United team that looked reinvigorated and one that, apparently, had a clear idea of what the game plan was. Too often that was not the case under his predecessor Laszlo.That produced a top performance and fine inidual displays, not least from man-of-the-match Paul McMullan.Less than two months ago it appeared his time at Tannadice could be up. On the evidence of his display at Thistle, the former Scotland U  could now be ready to show why McKinnon battled so hard to get him.Andthe work he, and others, did on the ball gave plenty of reason to look forward to the games that lie ahead, so too did the ferocious way the entire team battled to get it back when Partick had possession.Particularly under Laszlo, opposing teams were given too much time in possession, but now United look like a side that will get the ball back quickly.It’s why, while not getting ahead of themselves, United fans can again feel hopeful about their team."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-independence-supporters-launch-new-funding-bid-to-secure-support-for-the-cause","story":"Independence supporters have launched a new fundraising drive aimed at building majority support for the cause."},{"url":null,"title":"five-takeaways-in-and-around-glasgow-set-to-compete-for-best-in-scotland","story":"FIVE takeaways in and around Glasgow are set to head to London to battle-it-out for the best in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"lanarkshire-detectives-said-kevin-mcguire-was-targeted-by-at-least-two-men","story":"A MURDER inquiry has been launched after a-year-old man was stabbed repeatedly outside a house in a targeted attack."},{"url":null,"title":"riverford-gardens-first-release-of-homes-in-glasgow-private-housing-development-launches","story":"THE first release of properties in one of the cityrsquos largest private housing developments has been launched."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-credit-help-to-get-online-to-make-a-claim","story":"WITH smart phones, tablets and personal computers becoming a dominant feature in everyday le, you could be forgiven for thinking everyone is using the latest technology."},{"url":null,"title":"this-years-moiras-run-to-be-filmed-for-new-documentary","story":"RUNNERS honouring murdered Moira Jones will this year be filmed crossing the finishing line for a new documentary at the tenth anniversary of her death."},{"url":null,"title":"england-under-21s-claim-convincing-victory-over-scotland-under-21s-side","story":"England concluded their European Under- Championship qualication campaign unbeaten with a convincing - win over their Scotland counterparts at Tynecastle."},{"url":null,"title":"libby-mcarthur-i-think-queue-skipping-is-the-thin-edge-of-the-wedge-and-have-been-known-to-grab-folk","story":"Forty years ago my sister married a ldquoMalteser so having a wee, out of season, family visit, am writing to you now from Malta.

He won the Champions League and also claimed three Premier League titles, three FA Cups and four League Cups.So any advice or feedback from the -cap winning star is like gold dust – and will benefit the Reds.Lowe said: “It is frightening because with being , I am used to watching the gaffer in World Cups.“When he first came in I was a bit starstruck. But you have to listen to anything he says because he has been there and done it at World Cups and Champions League finals.“If he says something, I really pick up on it because I want to learn from him.”Aberdeen secured Lowe on a loan deal until January  from the Championship Rams the day before the summer transfer window closed.The -year-old had started the first two Championship games of the season for Derby only to fall down to third-choice left-back.However, such was Lampard’s faith in the defender, he signed him on a three-year contract extension  hours before he moved north to Pittodrie.Lowe remains in regular contact with Lampard and assistant Jody Morris, who also played for Cha.The Reds defender said: “The gaffer has been great with me since he came in during pre-season.“He has shown me the things I can do to improve and Jody is always on the phone to me as well.“I will text him after the game to let him know how I did and also to see how Derby did.“They get clips sent to them and Jody will tell me what I should and shouldn’t do defensively.“I take it all on board as they have both played at a high level and Jody has played in the Scottish league himself. There are no better people to work under.“Hopefully, Derby can do well this season as well as Aberdeen.”Lowe produced a superb performance in the - defeat of St Mirren at Pittodrie before the recent international break.He pitched in with his first goal for the Dons and also provided an assist for Sam Cosgrove to net his second of the game.Lowe said: “I love to get forward but I am a defender at the end of the day and that is my job.“However, at any opportunity I try to put some crosses into the box and get some goals.”Prior to the St Mirren game, manager McInnes had challenged Lowe to defend like a full-back and attack like a winger. Lowe delivered and was pivotal in that victory.McInnes said: “Max was positive, he was assertive, imposed himself on the wide player he was against and the pace he’s got is clear.“It was a lovely finish for his goal although I don’t know how he ended up on the penalty spot.“However, Max got there and it was a lovely, calm finish.”McInnes insists Lowe was secured to free up skipper and Scotland international Graeme Shinnie to operate in midfield.Lowe now faces a battle with Andy Considine to secure that left-back slot against league leaders Hearts.McInnes said: “We are enjoying working with Max and he is a youngster in the team who will get even better. He’ll have a good career and we’re grateful to have him.“Especially when at times we know the importance of Shinnie in the middle of the park.“Andyhas been a very strong left-back for me over the last few years.“There will be times when Andy is the better option to play there but against St Mirren, Max was the right one to play left-back.”Lowe recently indicated he would be happy to extend his loan spell beyond January until the end of the season.For McInnes that would have been the ideal scenario but admits it is too early into the loan spell to commit to that.When askedLowe’s loan could be extended, McInnes said: “The answer is I don’t know. We would have been happy to do a season-long loan but Derby are in charge of that, as it is with all loans.“The time to really look at that would be further down the line and seeing where Derby are, where Max is and where we are with regards the whole situation.“Butthis was December  and there was a decision to make, hopefully staying here would be a good one as he is a good option.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity shirt drive by lynx","story":"Ice hockey fans still have time to get their hands on shirts worn by the Aberdeen Lynx – and donate money to a good cause.The Granite City side are auctioning off their special orange third kit, pictured, worn in home fixtures during this year’s Scottish National LeagueEastern Conference.Proceeds from the auction of the one-off kits, which can be accessed via the Lynx’s facebook page, will go to Charlie House.The north-east- based children’s charity supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions.A club spokesman said: “These shirts are a one-off, never to be produced again, so they are extra special.”Bids will be accepted up until Sunday October  at pm, at which point the winners will be revealed.The Lynx will next play against Kilmarnock Thunder in the Scottish Cup, before closing their Eastern Conference – or Stuart Robertson Cup – campaign with an away fixture against Dundee Tigers on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"a listers support 3 9m expansion for sue ryder","story":"CELEBRITIES have backed a city charity’s £. million drive to nearly double the number of people it can care for.Eddie Redmayne, Kate Moss and Daniel Radclfe are among the A-list celebrities who are auctioning off personal items in aid of Sue Ryder Dee View Court.Staff at the Kincorth centre look after people with a range of neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease and motor neurone disease.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know.

It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal.

Mr Varese told the PA: “Trespass is due to move out in February and that’s when we will get the keys. “It will take six weeks to fit the shop out so we are looking at an opening date of April .

The business was set up by Mr Varese’s grandfather over  years ago. In recent years, their Glasgow chip shops have become a favourite with celebrities, with the likes of Justin Bieber and Nigella Lawson enjoying its food. Mr Varese said the Perth restaurant, which will cover  square feet, will promise something dferent.

Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it.

As well as offering a home for nature, bogs play a key role in water quality and flow and in a healthy state, peat is an essential weapon in the fight against climate change, acting as a massive sink for greenhouse gases.But when damaged they can release huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Now a further , hectares of damaged peatlands are starting on the road to recovery after the pound million in extra funding from the Scottish Government for the national Peatland Action scheme.It will be spent on conservation measures including landscaping to reduce exposed peat and the installation of peat dams to restore water levels in blanket bogs, which are vital to carbon capture and provide habitats for many important Scottish species.Work will involve blocking gullies to prevent the earth from drying out and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.Eroded areas of bare peat will also be re-planted to stabilise the surface.These measures will improve mountain vegetation, which will in turn benefit native wildle and birds such as the snipe, skylark and greenshank.Andrew McBride, Project Manager of the Peatland ACTION project said: ldquoPeat covers over % of Scotlandrsquos land area and it is estimated that over % of this is in a degraded condition.\"The SNH Peatland ACTION team works with land managers across Scotland and in partnership with other organisations to restore degraded peatlands ndash to date we have started the process of restoration on nearly ,ha of peatlands.\"Most of our work involves advising on ditch blocking, stabilising eroded areas, and re-establishing vegetation ndash most notably by the bog building plant sphagnum moss.ldquoNot only are peatlands part of our landscape and cultural heritage, providing a unique habitat for species such as large heath butterflies and sundew plants, they are important for our environment. Peat stores carbon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\"Peatbogs retain and filter water, reducing the impact of drought or flooding and keeping our burns clean for fishing and drinking.Across the world, large-scale degradation is causing serious environmental and social impact, with annual emissions estimated at around two gigatonnes of carbon dioxide -  per cent of all global emissions.Rewetting damaged peatlands can bring them back to good condition.Scots are being urged to avoid using peat-based compost in their gardens to help preserve resources.Conservationists say the current reliance on the ancient material for growing certain plants is \"totally unacceptable and unsustainable\", and people should turn to alternatives that are just as effective and readily available.Nearly a quarter of Scotlands entire land area - around two million hectares - is made up of peat bogs, which are estimated to contain around , million tonnes of carbon.The habitat also plays a crucial role in helping guard against flooding, purying water and supporting rare native wildle such as adders, golden plovers, dragonflies and carnivorous sundew plants.Extraction of peat destroys peatlands, which take thousands of years to form - laying down just mm per year. Some of Scotlands mires began forming in the Bronze age.The UK government has committed to abolishing the use of peat in amateur gardening by  and ending extraction of peat for the horticulture industry by .However, despite a signicant rise in uptake of alternative composts, peat use by gardeners has also been increasing.Industry figures show more than half of material used in bagged composts is peat, amounting to two million cubic metres every year.Around a third of all peat used for gardening in the UK comes from bogs in this country, while the remainder comes from Ireland and where in Europe.Conservation charity Plantle, which owns Munsary nature reserve in the internationally recognised Flow Country in Caithness - one of Europes most extensive areas of peatland - is working with organisations such as the Royal Horticultural Society, the Scottish Wildle Trust and the National Trust for Scotland to end use of peat in gardening and revitalise peatlands.Plantles Dr Trevor Dines said: \"For the love of peat, the time to wean ourselves off this precious, threatened natural resource is now.\"Our use of peat is simply unsustainable, hugely damaging to our peatlands - some of our best natural treasures - and simply not relevant in todays climate.\"We all have the opportunity to do the right thing by our gardens and countryside and demand a peat-free future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-power-to-use-100-wind-power-after-selling-off-last-coal-and-gas-stations","story":"The Spanish-owned giant has become the first major UK energy supplier to refocus entirely on renewable sources such as wind and solar.Its move comes a week after the International Panel on Climate Changewarned the world was \"off track\" in efforts to limit environmentally catastrophic global warming.IPCC scientists warned \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" were required.Scottish Power on Tuesday said it had sold its remaining conventional electricity generation business to a subsidiary of Drax Group for poundm.And it said it would invest pound.bn in UK to more than double existing  gigawatt capacity for renewable energy over the next four years.Ignacio Galaacuten, Chairman and Chief Executive of Iberdrola, Scottish Powers parent, said: \"Energy companies must be part of the solution to climate change.\"Iberdrola is acting now to cut carbon emissions  per cent by  and be carbon neutral by .

These include the design of stealth drones advocated by defence companies such as BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin.The discovery, which confirms the common plant among the natural worldrsquos best fliers, shows movement of air around and within its ldquoparachute-shaped bundle of bristles often enables seeds to travel half a mile or more, kept afloat entirely by windpower.Gardeners generally dislike dandelions as they are viewed as weeds which have huge taproots that break easily when being removed.It can also regenerate from the tiniest piece to four times the size of what gardeners were trying to remove in the first place.The featherweight seeds carry on the lightest breeze and lodge themselves into every crack in the ground and every millimetre of bare soil.:Drone ban for children proposedDandelion pollen is not particularly nutritious, compared with that of clover and vetches, but it is available when little  is about.From March to November it offers a reliable source of food for all species of bees, beetles, butterflies and hoverflies.Now researchers from Edinburgh University have carried out experiments to understand why dandelion seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure being largely made up of empty space.The findings show the seeds could be used in helping design under-the-radar technology such as drones for spy missions by the security services.The study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble forms as air moves through the bristles.This enhances the drag that slows each seedrsquos descent to the ground.The newly found form of air bubble, which scientists have named the separated vortex ring, is physically detached from the bristles and stabilised by air flowing through it.Researchers found that the amount of air is critical for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the seed in flight, and is precisely controlled by the spacing of the bristles.The flight mechanism of the bristly parachute underpins the seedsrsquo steady flight and is four times more efficient than a conventional parachute.Scientists say the dandelionrsquos porous parachute may inspire the development of small-scale drones that require little or no power.Such drones could also be useful for remote sensing or air pollution monitoring.:New dandelion find on St Kilda#They hope their findings can be used to help engineering and sustainable technology fields.Dr Cathal Cummins, of the universityrsquos Schools of Biological Sciences and Engineering, who led the study, said: ldquoTaking a closer look at the ingenious structures in nature, like the dandelionrsquos parachute, can reveal novel insights.BAE Systems recently unveiled an aircraft design that is viewed as a major advance in stealth technology.The Magma drone does away with aircraft control surfaces, which has resulted in an aircraft whose shape remains constant throughout its flight.The small demonstration aircraft, which has completed a successful first flight, uses blown air to change direction instead of complex mechanical controls.Most aeroplanes look unmoving in flight, like a wing hanging off a giant tube flying through the sky.But conventional aircraft use a system of elevators, rudders and ailerons to control their direction in the pitch and roll directions.:Drone photography poses risk to wildle - expertsThese mechanical devices are usually in the shape of control surfaces attached to the rear of the wing, horizontal and vertical stabilisers and are controlled by the pilot ndash or sometimes an onboard flight computer.Control surfaces have been an instrumental part of aircraft since the early th century. These mechanisms can and do fail, limiting an aeroplanersquos manoeuvrability.But among a new generation of stealth warplanes, control surfaces can also affect an airplanersquos carefully shaped stealth profile, as the fin-like device moves upward or downward, momentarily making the aircraft slightly more visible to radar.Now the Edinburgh University researchers are hopeful that the dandelion seeds can help advance the technology further.The study, published in science journal Nature, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Royal Society."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin-offers-to-extend-the-transition-period-may-has-not-ruled-it-out","story":"The countrys deputy prime minister Simon Coveney reacted positively to reports that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was open to pushing the implementation period back a year to end in December .UK Government sources insisted Downing Street was not calling for an extension to transition arrangements which is not an outright rejection.The offer will enrage Brexiteers who will argue it would keep the UK effectively in the single market and customs union for at least another year with British taxpayers continue to pay over billions of pounds to EU coffers.Plus, it would enrage UK fishermen as it would mean the country would not take back control of its waters until December  at the earliest more than five years after the  EU vote.Theresa May is preparing for what is likely to be a fractious Prime Ministers Questions in the Commons before she travels to Brussels for talks with Donald Tusk, the European Council President, and before she addressed EU leaders ahead of an EU dinner.There are growing concerns the two sides will be unable to bridge the gap over the key issue of agreeing a \"backstop\" deal to ensure there will not be ato a hard border in Ireland when the UK quits the EU.Mr Coveney told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"What Michel Barnier is now suggesting is, look, lets ensure that the backstop is never likely to be used by creating the space and time for the UK and the EU to be able to negotiate UK-wide customs arrangements that can ensure that there wont ever be the need for customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.\"We have always said that we are happy to show flexibility in terms of how we get to a destination where-by there is a backstop, or an insurance mechanism, in place to reassure people on the island of Ireland that they are not going to see the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure.\"And what Michel Barnier has indicated very clearly is that the EU side, certainly, is willing to allow more time in the transition period to agree an alternative solution to a backstop.\"The EU meeting is the occasion when the leaders of the remaining  member states were supposed to give the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britains withdrawal.But Mr Coveney made it clear that summit would not go ahead unless signicant progress is made on the border issue.He said: \"Whats more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there wont be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on.\"Both sides want to get a deal done here, and I think we need... to allow the negotiating teams to set the pace with a view to making recommendations, hopefully by mid-November, that a new summit is necessary to sign off on a final deal.\"Mr Tusk has warned that without new \"concrete proposals\" from the British to break the logjam over the Irish border backstop, further progress on a deal may be impossible.However, with her party split, and some Tory MPs openly calling for her to go, Mrs May has little room to manoeuvreshe is to secure a deal which stands any chance of getting through Parliament.Ahead of her visit to Brussels, Mrs May was able to secure the backing of her Cabinet, at least for now, amid reports that some Brexiteer ministers were prepared to quitshe gave too much ground to Brussels.However, there was anger among Tory Brexiteers after The Dailyreported that Chancellor Philip Hammond warned the meeting that the UK could still have to pay the EU up to pound billion of the pound billion \"orce bill\" to settle its outstanding liabilities, in the event of a no-deal break.The PM is also due to have bilateral meetings with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker,and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-a-smacking-ban-would-truly-make-us-a-civilised-nation","story":"So why would it be any dferent for a child  When parents chastise their children with a smack or a slap, it is far worse than hitting an adult. Grown-ups can defend themselves, or walk away. A partnership or marriage can end, but childhood lasts forever. Unless parental force is so extreme that the authorities have to step in, young children cannot escape their punishers. They simply have to grow wary, and hope it doesnrsquot happen again.Proposals to outlaw smacking, to be brought before Holyrood in a memberrsquos bill by Green MSP John Finnie, might become law within the year. It will be a historic day, a signal that we are among the most civilised of nations, committed to caring for those who canrsquot protect themselves.When you look at the levels of anger and violence in our own society, let alone the world, this change of culture canrsquot come soon enough. Yet the prospect of the ban has caused protests. Less than a thirdof respondents to a survey support it, and more than halfbelieve smacking should still be allowed.Their main worry, it seems, is not the welfare of children but the potential for so-called respectable adults to be criminalised for raising their offspring as they see fit. For some, as for their own parents and countless generations before them, teaching right from wrong involves tough love. How  can a toddler be prevented from running into the road  Surely a short, sharp lesson will make the point and potentially save their lives Well, perhaps. But to judge by the number of times Irsquove watched little ones yanked by the arm, thumped on the bottom or the back of the legs and even on one occasion slapped hard on the face ndash all without modying their behaviour ndash it would seem the message isnrsquot getting through. Pain and humiliation do not result in obedience and docility. When used too often, or fiercely, smacking causes resentment, rebellion and fear. A woman thwacking her spaniel to bring it to heel would be universally viewed with horror. Some might even dare to remonstrate. But when itrsquos a child, we are schooled to walk on, since itrsquos none of our business.In previous ages, when people were less educated, families large and money tight, physical punishment was deemed perfectly acceptable. Now, however, it looks uncomfortably like brutality. Since time immemorial the British attitude to children has been punitive, telling them to keep quiet, and allowing them to become the butt of unfeeling or sadistic schoolteachers as well as parents. Yet a teacher today who clipped a pupil over the ear or brought a ruler down on the back of their hands would be queuing up at the JobCentre before nightfall. Such acts were outlawed decades ago. By introducing a smacking ban, government will thus be calling time on the harsh treatment inflicted on children at home, where privacy no longer hides them from the reach of the law.Most parents will admit that smacking is not a sign that they are in charge, but that they have lost control. The signal it sends to youngsters is that aggression is a normal response to a situation. To the old argument that ldquoit never did me any harm, take a look at the levels of depression, addiction and anxiety around us. Coming under physical attack from the people who love you most is deeply and sometimes permanently scarring. It can lead to self-harming, to abusive relationships in adulthood and, since they have experienced it from infancy, to lashing out when under duress.Itrsquos half a century since Bob Dylan wrote his prophetic song in which he tells mothers and fathers: ldquoYour sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly aginrsquo. Please get out of the new one If you canrsquot lend your hand  For the times they are a-changinrsquo.They are indeed changing, and for the better. Rethinking how to educate and control children requires time, effort, and bottomless reserves of patience and self-restraint. It involves talking to youngsters, and reasoning with them, once they are old enough to understand, and drawing lines beyond which there will be consequences ndash but none of them violent.I know several young mums with demanding families, one with four boys below eight. She and her husband have acquired the sort of negotiating skills that could win us a brilliant Brexit deal. Explaining, being firm but kind, finding distractions, and never losing it are the new rules.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said she is delighted to see it being implemented so swtly.She said: \"By encouraging people to top up from the tap using refillable bottles, we will help cut down on our use of plastics and promote the benefits of hydration building on Scottish Waters Your Water, Your Le campaign.\"I now look forward to refilling my bottle at the Top Up Tap outside the parliament in the coming months.\"The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers.Water samples will be tested every two minutes, on average, to ensure that quality is maintained.Licensed premises are legally bound to serve tap water on request, yet research shows Scots are uncomfortable asking, something this campaign hopes to change. Customer research by Scottish Water revealed tap is the water of choice for almost two thirds of people in Scotland , and currently over a thirdcarry reusable bottles always or often when out and about. But less than a thirdsaid theyd be happy to go into a cafeacute and ask for their bottle to be filled.On average a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save pound. a day, nearly pound a year.The Top Up Taps are made from marine-grade steel and are connected to the mains water supply.* For further information visit www.yourwateryourleThursday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amThis week#s edition is now available in shops and online, here.

But the work is very intensive and requires the repeated closure of the vital road link multiple times every day.A road-rail ersion onto the neighbouring railway tracks has been created to allow key through-access for cars but this can only operate during gaps in rail services ndash causing serious disruption to drivers who miss those windows. At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption. She said bus replacement services would have less of an impact than the road closures.She said: \"Itrsquos been well documented that the current convoy system is having a hugely detrimental impact on pupils attending Plockton High School as well as local businesses.\"The situation is far from ideal. I believe a better solution is that ScotRail and Network Rail should terminate all trains at Strathcarron and for a bus replacement service to operate and call at all stations between Strathcarron and Kyle.

Notwithstanding that using the same logic about avoiding a hard border in Ireland would simply sht that hard border to between Scotland and England, the denial of such a deal would then be used by the SNP as a grievance to inflate demands for a second independence referendum. With passions running high about any dferent treatment of the component nations of the United Kingdom, the SNP would nurse their latest grievance to try and swing doubters their way in favour of independence. : Ruth Davidson and David Mundell in quit threat over BrexitMundell and Davidson recognise the strategic and tactical dangers in such an argument and have, rightly, called on the Prime Minister to not throw the SNP such an unintended advantage.Johnson, writing in his weekly newspaper column, also spotted the problem and rightly condemned the  choice between the EU iding our country or dictating our trade laws without us having a say.Borders are borders. Whether or not the border is a line on the ground or in the sea, there will be a place where the jurisdiction changes. That’s all it is, a change in the laws and who has the authority to enforce them. This normally takes place by someone stopping those in transit and seeking clarication that the people or goods comply with the dferent laws. The perception is that this always takes place when the border is crossed, but that’s not how it happens any more – technology has changed all that.Now people are often checked before they depart rather than when they arrive. Most people that take a flight have to prove who they are and show that they have the authority to enter the place of destinationat the flight gate before setting off. Nobody kicks up a fuss about this.The same goes for the transit of goods. When Guinness leaves Dublin to go to Belfast, Glasgow or Liverpool, the necessary paperwork is completed electronically taking account of the dfering duties, taxes and regulations so that it complies and any dues are paid to the correct authority. : Brexit: Labour members back second EU referendumThe beer truck is not stopped at the border. Only random checks are necessary and these are conducted anywhere on the journey by officials from any of the jurisdictions involved. There is no fuss made about this either.The idea that there will be a need for border checkpoints holding up traffic, asking for bills of lading is a mendacious invention by the EU to keep us in its Single Market and Customs Union – or ide our country. A physical border is not needed unless there is an occasional emergency such as an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Those arguing that there cannot be a trade deal without hard borders are the same people that want to keep us in the EU.

And they, he added, are “simply unwilling to have more turbines foisted upon them”.So they will doubtless be dismayed by the news that Scottish Power has sold off its gas and hydro plants to concentrate on wind and renewables, with plans to more than double the capacity of windfarms currently generating electricity or under construction. However, for others, it is a sign of things to come, a move that heralds a new age as the world moves towards a zero-carbon future that will enable us to avoid dangerous climate change and bring a literal breath of fresh air to blow away potentially deadly pollution.These two groups may seem implacably opposed to one another, but in reality they both make valid points. Scotland is famous all over the world for the romantic beauty of its landscape, a fact that helps encourage millions of tourists to come here. Allowing the industrialisation of the Highlands would be a scandal. But, fortunately, that does not need to happen. Scotland has vast amounts of wind energy and it is possible to site onshore windfarms in places where they do not desecrate the countryside. : Scottish Power becomes first big UK energy firm to switch to % wind powerAnd the most consistent supply of wind is found out to sea, particularly on the west coast, as anyone who has visited the Outer Hebrides can attest. The UK Government has been criticised for failing to encourage onshore windfarms – not least because they are a source of increasingly cheap electricity. However, part of Westminster’s strategy has been to encourage offshore wind in the hope that the UK – and particularly Scotland – can create a globally signicant industry. As UK Energy Minister Claire Perry pointed out in The Scotsman yesterday, the transition to renewable energy is a challenge but also “one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time”. So Scotland can help the world fight climate change and make money in the process.And it is the latter reason that is perhaps the most important driving force, as Scottish Power’s chief executive Keith Anderson suggested when he said: “We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.” The firm has become the first of the ‘Big Six’ to ditch fossil fuels but simple economics means it is unlikely to be the last,: UK Energy Minister: Scotland has a chance of a letime on green energy©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie

Irish border.At the start of a summit that had previously been earmarked as the deadline for a breakthrough, both sides admitted the deadlock would take more time to untangle and said they were willing to extend the post-Brexit transition until the end of .The admission will anger Brexiteers in the Conservative Party and pose a particular challenge to Scottish Conservative MPs, who have

Brussels last night, setting out the UK’s position on Brexit talks before leaving the summit while they discussed her comments over dinner.“We have shown we can do dficult deals constructively,” Mrs May told the EU leaders. “I remain confident of a good outcome.”: Six-year-old boy wins right to sue Orkney-based ing company after death of fatherShe added: “The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.”A UK source said the Prime Minister issued an appeal “to find a creative way out of this dilemma” on the Irish border and reiterated she was “fully committed to finding a legally operative backstop” that guarantees no hard border in Ireland.However, despite a call from European Council president Donald Tusk for “new facts” on the Irish border, there was little evidence of fresh proposals to break the stalemate.Speaking after hearing Mrs May’s address to EU leaders, European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said: “There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn’t perceive anything substantially new in terms of content as I listened to Mrs May.”Mr Tajani added the Prime Minister had said she was willing to consider a proposal from the EU to extend the transition period.An EU source confirmed Mrs May was ready to consider adding an extra year.Arriving at the summit, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had told reporters that “much more time” was needed to reach a breakthrough.“We are not there yet ... we will continue the work in the next weeks calmly and patiently,” he said.EU leaders must now decide whether to hold an emergency summit next month, despite warnings from leaders including French president Emmanuel Macron that no further meeting could take place without progress on the Irish border.A November summit could be used to focus on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.A final Brexit deal could now be put off until as late as December – beyond the point at which Mr Barnier had said an agreement was essential.The French Government yesterday published draft no-deal legislation that could require British citizens to obtain a visa before travelling to France following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.EU leaders voiced frustration at Mrs May’s inability to command the full support of her party.Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite claimed the Prime Minister didn’t have a “strong mandate”.Ms Grybauskaite said it was dficult for the EU to “negotiate with a person who has no full support of the position”.And Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said last night: “We are

In those circumstances, there would be no need for any proposal of this sort and I’m clear that I expect the implementation period to end at the end of December .”Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said any extension to the transition period could delay full withdrawal almost until the general election scheduled for May , and “may mean we never leave at all”.Tory MP Nadine Dorries repeated her call for former Brexit secretary David Davis to replace Mrs May as leader.“We cannot find the money to fund our front-line police properly, we cannot find the £ billion for the vulnerable on Universal Credit, but we can mysteriously find billions to bung to the EU for the unnecessary extra year Clegg and Blair asked Barnier for to waylay Brexit,” said Ms Dorries.Conservative former minister Nick Boles - who is pushing for a “soft Brexit” move to temporary membership of the European Free Trade Association- warned Mrs May is losing the confidence of the Tory party.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme the EU is demanding “humiliating concessions” because the PM’s Brexit plans fail to fix the problem of the Irish border.“I’m afraid she is losing the confidence now of colleagues of all shades of opinion,” he said.“They are close to despair at the state of this negotiation because there is a fear that both the Government and the European Union are trying to run out the clock, that they are trying to leave this so late that they can credibly say there is no alternative but a no-deal Brexit, and most people agree that would be chaos.“That is not an acceptable way for a leader of a government to behave.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: “Extending the transition  More like kicking the can further down the road and delaying, by a bit, driving off the clf.“No deal the PM can secure will be as good as staying in the EU.”Meanwhile, leading Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg joined Mr Davis and three other former ministers in signing an open letter warning the Prime Minister not to “bind the UK into the purgatory of perpetual membership of the EU’s customs union”.The group called on Mrs May to “reset” the negotiations and ditch her Chequers Brexit blueprint in favour of a Canada-style free trade agreement.“We are close to the moment of truth. Brexit offers the prize of a better future, global free trade deals and political independence,” said the letter.“Butthese potential gains are sacriced because of EU bullying and the Government’s desperation to secure a deal, the British people will not forgive us.”Mrs May initially suggested an “implementation period” of around two years after Brexit, to give the UK’s authorities and companies time to prepare for new arrangements, but later accepted a -month transition ending on the last day of .It emerged on Wednesday that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is ready to discuss a further year’s extension to allow time to find a solution to keep the Irish border open.UK officials stressed the Prime Minister is not proposing any extension to the period already agreed.Leaders of the  remaining EU states ditched proposals for a special Brexit summit in November, after Mr Barnier told them he needed “much more time” to find a way to avoid a hard border.This week’s summit had been billed as “the moment of truth” when agreement is needed to allow time for ratication in the Westminster and European parliaments.But Mrs May has not come forward with the new “concrete proposals” demanded by European Council president Donald Tusk, instead telling fellow leaders that “courage, trust and leadership” are needed on both sides to find a solution.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof.

Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion.

But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit.

Such a move would require their MPs to swear an oath of allegiance to the reigning British monarch.Deputy Martin made the remarks after he was asked about the possibility of Fianna Fáil merging with the Social Democratic and Labour Partyto contest elections north of the border.Speaking to reporters in Malahide, Martin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.Before taking a seat in Wesminster, successful MPs must swear either an oath of allegiance or a solemn affirmation to “be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors”.In February, Fianna Fáil held an event to honour Constance Markievicz who  years previously became the first woman MP when she was elected to Westminster as the Sinn Féin MP for the St Patrick’s ward of Dublin. She refused to take her seat and instead sat in the First Dáil.Sinn Féin MPs in the North continue to stand on an abstentionist ticket.Responding to criticism from other Fianna Fáil TDs over their continued policy of abstentionism, Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey said in March :“We are not British MPs, we are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland. Sinn Féin goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National

they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on

interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church.

Government departments carried out a fth of the procedures, % were done by non-profit organisations, and commercial organisations carried out  procedures.The harm the tests cause to animals is also broken down into categories.The highest level is severe, accounting for % of tests.These usually involve long-term disease testing and can cause \"a major departure from the animals usual state of health and well-being\" including \"animals found dead unless an informed decision can be made that the animal did not suffer severely prior to death\".Moderate tests, accounting for nearly two-thirds of experiments, cause \"a signicant and easily detectable disturbance to an animals state, but is not le threatening\".Non-recoveryis when the entire procedure is carried out under general anaesthesia without recovery.Sub-thresholdand mild procedurescause only minor and transitory discomfort.The dogs and cats involved were only subjected to mild procedures, while over , mice underwent moderate or severe procedures.Mr Agnew said more needed to be done to find alternatives to testing live animals.\"According to these stats, on average every day last year  animals were subject to often painful and damaging experiments,\" he said.\"These animals were subjected to procedures that are often painful, distressing and which cause long-term harm.\"Specically, , procedures were described as moderate or severe which inflict pain, suffering and sometimes death upon the animal.\"He added: \"Im disturbed at this rise. I want to know why we are using more animals in experiments rather than seeking alternative methods.\"Ill be writing to the permanent secretary for the Department of Health to ask how we can phase out the use of animals in these often painful and deadly experiments.\"The report states The AnimalsAct  established \"a rigorous system of controls\" for scientic work on living animals.This includes a requirement that projects and researchers are licensed as well as \"stringent safeguards on animal pain and suffering\" are in place and general requirements to ensure the care and welfare of animals.This month personal care company Unilever, which owns skincare brand Dove, called for an international ban on animal testing on cosmetics.The controversial practice has been banned in the European Union since , but research from the group Cruelty Free International suggests  million animals are still being used around the world to test beauty products every year.Humane Society International has said it hoped Unilevers stance would inspire other beauty brands to abandon animal testing completely.In September the State of Calornia announced it would ban all brands tested on animals by .The Department of Health, Queens and Ulster University had not replied to requests for a response at the time of going to press."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic updates delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Last night he said they should \"think and act as Irish people\".He has also stood over remarks made on Independent.ies Floating Voter podcast that Travellers are \"basically people camping in someone s land\". Reacting to Mr Caseys latest comments, the co-director of the Traveller advocacy group Pavee Point, Martin Collins, said the millionaires latest contribution has \"compounded the situation\". \"He has added insult to injury,\" Mr Collins said.A number of councillors who helped Mr Casey get on the ballot paper have said they do not regret giving him their vote, although most said they disagree with his comments.Despite the controversy, Mr Casey plans to travel to Cabra Bridge in Thurles to see a €.m development that has been built for Travellers who are currently living on an unauthorised site nearby.It has been reported the families want access to two stables and at least half-an-acre of land each for their horses.Mr Casey has been critical of the role played by Pavee Point in the dispute, saying they should tell the Travellers about people \"sleeping on the streets of Dublin\".Mr Casey was asked by presenter Pat Kenny about his controversial comments yesterday on the first televised Irish Presidential debate with all six candidates.\"We have so many wonderful nationalities here, its wrong to single out one particular ethnic group dferently,\" he said.\"One of the county councils who endorsed me was Tipperary, and as you know we have a housing crisis at the moment.\"When I was down there, there was €.m spent building six houses that the Travelling community wouldnt move into because they wanted sheds and two stables and one acre of land.\"Why should they be given the right to turn down a house  I think that is wrong.\"Current President Michael D Higgins has highlighted that Traveller men have  years less le expectancy than other males, and are six times more likely to commit suicide.Kenny asked candidatesthey would like Traveller people to live next door to them.Mr Higgins said: \"Yes, I have a halting site a couple of hundred yards from my house and they are wonderful people.\"And speaking earlier on RTEs Six One News he defended his position, saying: \"Theres far too much political correctness in society... I say what I think and I think what I say.\"He has received a considerable level of support on social media. However, Mr Collins said that Pavee Point has represented the Travelling community well and the candidates view of the situation in Tipperary is \"misinformed\".

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diane Dodds MEP Speaking on the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster radio programme, Mrs Dodds described talk of extending the Brexit transition period from December  to December  as “an interesting proposal”, but stressed that it “doesn’t really solve or resolve the unacceptable proposal of the backstop.”The DUP representative said extending the transition period could cost the UK another £ billion in contributions to the EU, and argued that it would be “a hard sell” for the Prime Minister in London.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson insisted that a backstop arrangement would do “nothing more than allow the north to stand still” and accused the DUP of “propping up a British government that’s creating chaos.”She went on to claim that people here support the backstop proposal.• Read related story -

Across the land, the sight of heads bowed over small screens is now ubiquitous.“But what our research shows is just how attached to our mobile phones we really are – and perhaps without even realising it.”The research also indicated that two-thirds of mobile phone userscheck their phones while in bed despite sleep issues having been linked to the blue light emitted by phone screens and other devices.Some hardware manufacturers have introduced night light features to lower the amount of blue light emitted by devices in an effort to reduce the impact of late night usage.“We can only speculate on the impact this is having in terms of our relationships with colleagues, friends and even close family – but our survey does suggest that traditional conversations are being discarded, in favour of checking our latest email, notication or message,” Mr Feldman said.Killers ‘not protected’ after RUC ice cream man murder: Police ombudsman Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.

The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water.

There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sunrsquos powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of  kilometresper second.The European Space Agencyrsquos Mercury Planet Orbiter , which will survey the planetrsquos surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Mission controllers at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, are making their final preparations Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module , in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiterrsquos  instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometerwas designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxarsquos Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiterwill study the planetrsquos internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled ldquoheat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: ldquoUK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColomboand the incredibly sophisticated set of scientic instruments on board.ldquoThe international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the newspace age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.This marks Europersquos first mission to the planet Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury.

Even aged  he was still working, enjoying meeting customers - people he always had a smile and plenty of time for.Bosco was a tall fit man, a charasmatic character who had a great sense of humour and engaging personality.He was the le and soul of a party and loved the craic.He enjoyed winding people up and could be full of devilment. He never failed to get a laugh. And he loved a laugh, a good pint of Guinness and spending time with family and friends.As a neighbour he was thoughtful, always popping in for a yarn and a cup of tea.

Indeed Bosco had been out fishing the day before he took ill just two weeks ago.Bosco Campbell was immersed in the Maghery community and was involved in many clubs and committees.He was a former Chairman, President and player of Maghery Sean MacDermott’s who held a Guard of Honour at his funeral yesterday.And he was also a member and former chairman of the management committee of Maghery Community Hall.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next.

We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
