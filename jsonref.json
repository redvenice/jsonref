Former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential front-runner, visited Virginia over the weekend to campaign with several statehouse candidates, and Republican Vice President Mike Pence held a rally on Saturday.Other Democratic presidential contenders, including U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, have also campaigned with local candidates.In one notable race, Democrat Shelly Simonds, who lost a state House of Delegates race in 2017 via random draw after the election ended in a tie, won a rematch against Republican David Yancey.Virginia\u0027s Democratic gains came despite a year of scandal for the party\u0027s top officials in the state. Governor Ralph Northam barely endured a political firestorm after his yearbook page was shown to have photos of someone in blackface and another person in a Ku Klux Klan costume, while Attorney General Mark Herring admitted to wearing blackface himself in college.Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, meanwhile, has denied two accusations of sexual assault.The legislative wins likely mean that Democrats can pass a raft of bills that Republicans had resisted, including new gun limits.

A spokesperson said on Tuesday that after all the options had been considered, a decision had been taken that the most efficient way to complete the project and safeguard visitors, staff and the collection was to close completely from 29 June 2020 until spring 2023.London’s loss will be the the rest of the UK’s gain with exhibitions and projects planned with York Art Gallery, the Holburne Museum in Bath, the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle, National Museums Liverpool and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.• Displaying more than 100 royal portraits, ning 500 years from the Tudors to the Windsors, at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.• A series of special projects with its neighbour the National Gallery. That will include the display of Holbein’s preparatory drawing of Henry VIII alongside his painting The Ambassadors – a star of the National Gallery – for the first time.• A continuation of the Coming Home project where portraits are lent to places they are most associated with. In 2020 that will include Florence Nightingale going to Derby, Richard III to York, Malala Yousafzai to Birmingham and Meera Syal to Wolverhampton.• Portrait shows touring to three National Trust properties: Mottisfont in Hampshire, Basildon Park in Berkshire, and Hughenden in Buckinghamshire.• Partnerships with schools and communities across the UK. For example a project exploring steel in Middlesbrough and football in Wembley.Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, called the redevelopment “a unique and important chapter in our history” which would transform the gallery and enable it “to become more welcoming and engaging to all and fulfil our role as the nation’s family album”.He encouraged other organisations to get in touch about working together “to circulate a national collection as widely as possible in both innovative and collaborative ways”.Precisely what will happen to the gallery’s 270 staff during the closure remains to be seen. A spokesperson said: “Closure of the gallery building will necessitate staff changes and inevitably there will be some job losses.“Where possible, staff will be offered part-time working and career break opportunities and the gallery is looking at a range of secondment opportunities with other institutions during the building period.”The FDA, the senior civil service union, said the closure would inevitably lead to potential redundancies, uncertainty and other complications for National Portrait Gallery staff and urged them to join a union to support them through any changes.Closing the gallery entirely is an unusual step, although not without precedents. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam was scheduled to close for three years for its £318m overhaul, one which dragged to 10 years.More than 1.5 million people visited the National Portrait Gallery in 201819 which also raises questions of where they might go, and whether numbers will increase for neighbouring galleries and attractions.The redevelopment project is called Inspiring People, and represents the gallery’s biggest ever redevelopment since the building in St Martin’s Place opened in 1896.The designs, by Jamie Fobert Architects, include a complete refurbishment of the building, the creation of new public spaces and a new learning centre. All that will allow a “comprehensive redisplay” of the collection.One of the most eye catching elements of the redevelopment will be a new grander entrance pointing north, to complement the current narrow entrance which feels to some like entering a Tardis. When the gallery was first built, a rich donor insisted it should not have an entrance pointing north towards the filth of Soho and Covent Garden.The gallery said it had secured £32.7m of its £35.5m target. It includes a £9.4m grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and a £6.5m grant from the trustees of the Garfield Weston Foundation of a new public wing, currently used as offices."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73bf74eb0b7502ede6380e16aadb68473507ff5e/0_0_5422_3252/master/5422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e38883b8c530eff3707c601ec716f9f","title":"like looking through butterfly wings ira cohens mylar chamber in pictures","story":"In a New York loft 50 years ago, poet, photographer and film-maker Ira Cohen hung reflective Mylar film on hinged boards, walls and ceiling, and invited visitors – including William Burroughs and Jimi Hendrix – to explore an experimental space"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05547f929de2907076ee8e09f1b296545f705ec9/0_0_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0ae704048930aa93689e033c7eba61","title":"discworld dishes moby dick bbc unveils 100 novels that shaped our world","story":"Panel of experts charged with listing the fiction that has affected them most goes for bestsellers as well as literary classicsThere’s no Wuthering Heights, no Moby-Dick, no Ulysses, but there is Half of a Yellow Sun, Bridget Jones’s Diary and Discworld: so announced the panel of experts assembled by the BBC to draw up a list of 100 novels that shaped their world.The choices were made by Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, Syima Aslam, founder of the Bradford literature festival, authors Juno Dawson, Kit de Waal and Alexander McCall Smith and journalist Mariella Frostrup. The list is intended to mark the 200th anniversary of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, widely seen as the progenitor of the English-language novel.The books chosen by the panel are those that have made a personal impact on them, and are ided into 10 categories. These include “love, sex and romance”, which features titles ranging from Jilly Cooper’s Rivals to Judy Blume’s Forever “identity”, which moves from Toni Morrison’s Beloved to Zadie Smith’s White Teeth and “adventure”, which includes Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials, Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe and Raymond Chandler’s The Big Sleep.“So many amazing novels are not on the list,” said Dawson. “As this panel of judges, we’re not qualified to say this is the definitive list, but we are qualified to say these are our favourites. We knew right from the beginning that the role of these lists, almost, is for people to disagree with them … and we could only pick 100 books.”So while there’s no Wuthering Heights, the Brontë sisters do feature on the list with Anne Brontë’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. And while Moby-Dick doesn’t appear, Herman Melville does – with Bartleby, the Scrivener.She added that she had pushed for more children’s and young adult titles to be included on the list, “because if it weren’t for the books we loved as children, we wouldn’t be readers as adults”. So alongside Orlando, Middlemarch and Our Mutual Friend, the list also features The Witches, The Hunger Games, Noughts and Crosses and The Earthsea trilogy.BBC Arts director Jonty Claypole said the list took “months of enthusiastic debate” to put together. “There are neglected masterpieces, irresistible romps as well as much-loved classics. It is a more erse list than any I have seen before, recognising the extent to which the English-language novel is an art form embraced way beyond British shores,” he said.The unveiling of the list launches a year-long celebration of literature at the BBC, headed by the new BBC Two series Novels That Shaped Our World. Beginning on 9 November, the series will explore the novel from the perspective of women’s voices, the empire and working-class experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/406e29f0276a69cb4cabda4c0d15f2b33603eade/0_142_7500_4499/master/7500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d00eb27684128680f65c9c26d295168","title":"archie roach you can reach the darkest point in our life and come back and come good","story":"With Indigenous suicide rates at an epidemic level, the songwriter regrets not talking sooner about his own battle with mental health. Telling his story through music, and memoir, has helped him heal• Read more about  Australia’s Unmissable books of 2019For the Gunditjmara people of south-west Victoria, the kneeangar – what white Australians call the wedge-tailed eagle – is the creator of the landscape. For the Bundjalung of north-east New South Wales, it is the gunggayay, or red-bellied black snake.On the spine of Archie Roach’s memoir, Tell Me Why, the gunggayay encircles the kneeangar, a logo that encapsulates the Indigenous songwriter’s heritage: his Bundjalung father Archie Senior, and his Gunditjmara mother Nellie Austin.But Roach, who first came to national attention in 1990 with his celebrated song Took the Children Away and accompanying debut album Charcoal Lane, is also the foster son of Alex and Dulcie Cox: Dad Alex and Mum Dulcie, as he calls them.The Coxes were told that Archie’s birth parents had died in a house fire. In fact, he had been stolen from them in the late 1950s at Framlingham mission, near Warrnambool. “They were used,” Roach, now 63, says when we meet, as he rests in a Sydney hotel room. “They’re blameless, as far as I’m concerned.”Alex and Dulcie cherished Archie but, he writes, “there was always a restlessness in me, like a faultline waiting to rupture”. When he was 15, he received a letter from a hitherto unknown sister, Myrtle – one of six siblings – telling him Nellie had died.The faultline ruptured. Roach writes that before leaving to find his brothers and sisters, Dad Alex – a Glaswegian immigrant who also yearned for his homeland – told him: “Bifay ye leave me and Ma, I jes wanted tae say … Well, we hope ye fin what ye lookin for, Archie.”He never saw them again.The title of Tell Me Why – which is being released alongside an album of new songs and re-recorded versions of many of his classics – is both rhetorical and a plea. “It’s trying to come to terms with it happening, rather than denying that it happened or just pushing it aside and thinking, ‘Oh, something happened to me as a kid, but it doesn’t really matter.’“It was more than that. You want to assure people, or reassure people, that this actually happened. And yourself as well.” Roach frequently slips into the second person, talking about “yourself” when he’s actually referring to himself, preserving a kind of distance.In his concerts, Roach has taken to introducing Took the Children Away by saying that every time he sings it, he lets a little bit of pain go. One day, he says, that pain will be gone and he will be free.Similarly, he tells the  that the process of writing Tell Me Why helped heal some of his grief for his estranged, now deceased adoptive parents. “I’d never talked about them before, and I was able to do that, so I was able to let that go.”Tell Me Why reveals much more of Roach than was previously known. Nearly half the book is taken up with his years of drinking in the parks and pubs and “empties” (vacant buildings) of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, as he reconnected with his surviving family members.Naturally, those years also took a terrible toll. Roach suffered from epilepsy as a result of his alcoholism, and there’s a shockingly raw description of a suicide attempt at the end of a bender, after an attempt to dry out. There are stints in hospital, and prison too.Roach has also survived a stroke, has had half a lung removed due to cancer, and gave up a kidney to his late brother Lawrence. The transplant wasn’t a success.These days, Roach needs a wheelchair to get around, and has a tendency to speak with his eyes closed. But when he fixes them on you, they’re full of light.Of his attempt on his life, Roach says it’s something he “probably should have mentioned before”, with suicide rates among Aboriginal people, including children, at epidemic levels. “You can reach the darkest point in our life and come back, and come good, even better.”But Tell Me Why is also a love story for Roach’s partner Ruby Hunter, who died in 2010. Hunter, too, had been stolen she and Roach referred to each other as “dad” and “mum” respectively.“It was a term of endearment,” Roach chuckles. But there was also more to it: “It’s good to use those words ‘mum’ and ‘dad’, they’re very powerful words when you’re a stolen kid. I suppose they take on deeper meaning when you’re a bit older, as well.”It was Hunter who kicked Roach up the backside when, on the cusp of his first album and record deal, Roach nearly walked away from music entirely. It was 1990, and Paul Kelly and guitarist Steve Connolly had billed the almost unknown artist on a gig at what is now Melbourne’s Hamer Hall, to a dumbstruck audience.Roach played just two songs, Beautiful Child and Took the Children Away. The latter song, sung in Roach’s pure, earnest voice, starts with the words, “This story’s right, this story’s true. I would not tell lies to you.”Both songs were met with complete silence. Then, as he left the stage, the applause began: “It started slowly and then it came down hard. I turned around and held my guitar up in the air, like this” – he raises his arms – “yeah!”He had first played Took the Children Away in Sydney in 1988, at a Bicentennial protest. On that occasion, too, the crowd had been left stunned and weeping. When he later played the song on a community radio station in Melbourne, the switchboard lit up.The term “stolen generations” didn’t exist then, and Roach, a shy man, was uncomfortable being a spokesman for them. “I was reluctant, I think, to put myself out there and have that sort of scrutiny,” he confesses. “It frightened me a bit.” He told Hunter he’d quit.Hunter, Roach writes, drew herself up to her full height – which admittedly was not very much – put her hands on her hips and said, “It’s not all about you, Archie Roach. How many blackfellas you reckon get to record an album?”Other Indigenous singer-songwriters followed. One, Adam Briggs, recorded a sequel to Took the Children Away, and invited Roach to guest on AB Original’s album, on which Roach spoke of bringing Melbourne to a standstill during land rights marches in the 70s and 80s.While his songs are quiet – he writes that “empathy was my impetus” – he reserves a place for anger and direct action. “A lot of people are getting upset about young people in the street disrupting traffic, especially these climate protesters,” he says.“I’m thinking, well, what’s a day’s disruption compared to the total annihilation of the planet? What’s wrong with you people? You need to make a racket! You need to be in their face.”Before he left the Cox family, Roach worshipped at a Pentecostal church in Melbourne, and even spoke in tongues. He drew comfort from the hymns that informed his own songs, and from Jesus’ words: “Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.”Roach eventually reconciled his Christian upbringing with his own heritage. “I found my own culture, which is not so much about religion but it’s about being a spiritual person, in our connection to the earth and the cosmos.”Around his neck hangs a necklace, at the end of which flies a wedge-tailed eagle.• Tell Me Why by Archie Roach is out now through Simon \u0026amp Schuster.

A Labour source said: “This is an embarrassing slapdown to Tory ministers who were blatantly trying to use the civil service for political purposes.”McDonnell is believed to have personally complained to the Treasury’s most senior mandarin, Sir Tom Scholar, hours before the planned launch of the costings, about the use of the civil service for political ends .The shadow chancellor made the complaint after weekend press reports said the Conservatives would publish official costings of Labour’s spending plans on Tuesday – the last day before purdah pre-election restrictions on the use of the civil service come into force.Labour’s legal team also wrote to Treasury civil servants to complain about the “ethics and propriety” around publishing the analysis.After the complaint from the shadow chancellor, the Cabinet Office wrote in an email to the Labour party, seen by the : “To confirm our conversation, these costings will not be published.”McDonnell said he warned the civil service that the Conservatives’ exercise was an abuse of power, telling the Independent: “I said first of all… you do not know what is in the manifesto so that is pure speculation. Secondly, this being done within hours of the formal campaign being undertaken. Thirdly, I think it’s an abuse of power.”He added: “I’m happy for anyone to examine our policies, but to do this hours before a general election campaign is I think an abuse of power. Unacceptable.”Previous governments have used the Treasury machine to criticise opposition party spending plans. George Osborne used a dossier of civil service reports to attack Ed Miliband’s policies in 2015, although its publication was in the January of that year, significantly ahead of the May 2015 election.Labour has ramped up its policy announcements in recent days, including promises to end rough sleeping and a pledge to remove all traces of privatisation from the NHS.Labour’s plans for wide-scale nationalisation came under scrutiny last month from the Confederation of British Industry, which warned the scheme would cost almost £200bn. The lobby group was later criticised for exaggerating its analysis.Earlier on Tuesday, Labour’s proposals for a four-day week with no loss of pay was given a £17bn price tag by the Centre for Policy Studies, a centre-right thinktank.Both Labour and the Conservatives have yet to publish manifestos with their full spending proposals ahead of the election. While the Tories were hoping to attack Labour’s economic record, Boris Johnson’s party has also faced criticism over its proposals to loosen the government purse strings.The Resolution Foundation thinktank said earlier this week that spending sprees aimed at ending austerity were central to the plans of both major parties and would drive spending up to levels last seen in the 1970s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ecb94fbf064d6a75d08e08ab9ad9379463f402b/0_228_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73dfadcecfd52c48126543e25e263210","title":"boeing 737 cracks ryanair grounds three planes due to cracking between wing and fuselage","story":"Exclusive: budget Irish carrier is the latest airline worldwide to be affected by ‘pickle fork’ cracking, but has not disclosed the problemAt least three Ryanair Boeing 737s have been grounded due to cracks between the wing and fuselage but this was not disclosed to the public, the  can reveal.The budget Irish airline is the latest to be affected by faults in the “pickle fork” structure, which has sparked an urgent grounding of 50 planes globally since 3 October.While other airlines, such as Australia’s Qantas and America’s Southwest, have disclosed the number of their planes affected by the cracks, Ryanair – which operates the largest fleet of 737s in Europe – has previously refused to confirm how many of its planes have been affected.Last Thursday, the airline told the  it “does not expect” the global pickle fork issue would “have any impact upon our operations or fleet availability”. can now reveal three of their planes have been affected by the issue.It is understood that experts do not regard the presence of the cracks as a safety issue as long as appropriate checks are carried out.The grounded planes have the registration numbers EI-DCL, EI-DAL and EI-DCJ. All three are more than 15 years old.Flight tracking site Flight Aware shows that DCL and DAL are both currently in a known plane repair site, the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California.The third plane, DCJ, is in storage at Stansted airport in London.A copy of internal Ryanair engineering logs, seen by the , lists all three as having “pickle fork cracks”.On Monday, Ryanair did not respond to detailed questions about the aircraft. A spokesman said it was continuing to review aircraft in line with the US Federal Aviation Authority, and “did not expect any impact on its operations or fleet availability”.On Tuesday, after being presented with more evidence, a spokeswoman subsequently added that the airline did not expect “this tiny number of findings” would “have any impact on our operations or our fleet availability”.She said Ryanair had completed all inspections on planes with over 30,000 lifetime flight cycles, and is currently inspecting those under 30,000, and had not found any further issues.A cycle is one take-off and one landing.The airline owns more than 450 737-NGs, which are the affected model. However, there is no suggestion any other of their planes have been affected.The pickle fork is a large structure that strengthens the connection between the wing and the body of the plane. Cracks were first found on 737s in China, prompting an urgent check.On 3 October, the US Federal Aviation Authority issued an urgent directive that all 737s above 30,000 flight cycles should be checked within a week.Ryanair would not say how many flight cycles the three grounded planes had completed.According to publicly available flight records, DCL suddenly stopped flying after 3 October. DAL and DCJ also stopped flying within a week of 3 October.According to Ryanair, the average age of their existing 737s is six-and-a-half years.According to the US FAA directive of 3 October, all 737s over 30,000 cycles needed to be urgently checked within seven days. Those between 22,600 and 30,000 needed to be checked within 1,000 cycles (approximately seven months, depending on frequency).However, last week Australia’s Qantas discovered cracks in three planes that were below the 30,000 limit. The three planes were at roughly 27,000 cycles.As a result, the Australian airline fast-tracked the checking process, examining all 33 of its 737s above 22,600 cycles within a week, rather than seven months.Ryanair did not respond when asked if it would do the same. The airline would not disclose how many planes were above 30,000 cycles, 27,000 cycles or 22,600.In Australia, Qantas rejected appeals to ground all its 737s, or to conduct checks of those below 22,000 cycles – of which it had 42.Globally, there are over 7,000 737-NGs in service. So far, Boeing has checked 1,000 aircraft and discovered faults in 50 of them.This includes nine in South Korea, three belonging to Southwest Airlines in the US, and 11 owned by Brazilian airline Gol. The pickle fork issue is separate to issues with the 737 Max, which is a newer model of plane designed to replace the current 737s.Last week, Virgin Australia said it had 19 737s over 22,600 cycles and none had cracks. Qantas said on Friday it had checked all 33 planes above 22,600 cycles, and found no further cracks.Dr Garth Pearce, a senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of New South Wales, said the presence of cracks was not a threat to safety.He said that as long as airlines followed the regulator’s requirements – checking older planes within a week, and other planes within seven months – that would satisfy his safety concerns.“These parts, in addition, are designed to be very tolerant of small cracks,” he said. “The fact that this incident occurred is not a scandal, it shows the industry is working as expected.“This whole process shows that regulation really does work in the aerospace industry … I wouldn’t recommend that airlines do anything other than what the regulator asked them.”He added that the percentage of cracks would drop, as the inspectors started looking at newer and newer planes.Last month, Boeing designated Victorville as the repair site for pickle fork cracks, as reported by Bloomberg.A spokesman for Boeing said it would “not provide list of customers impacted”.Ryanair has also been hit by delays to its large order of Boeing 737 Max planes, which are currently grounded worldwide as regulators test Boeing’s solution to software problems.The chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said: “We have reduced our expectation of 30 Max aircraft being delivered to us in advance of peak summer 2020 down to 20 aircraft and there is a real risk of none.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f536149f6aece9a9a3bdbc44c7a11814a5dd2b9/0_460_5740_3445/master/5740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5075e56948237596c7789e7328f1870b","title":"green streets which city has the most trees","story":"Urban trees offer huge benefits for climate regulation and personal wellbeing – and cities from Tampa to Frankfurt are intent on boosting their numbersThe Florida city of Tampa claims a number of firsts: the world’s largest pirate festival America’s longest continuous sidewalk (at 4.5 miles) and Babe Ruth’s longest ever home run (587 feet).Tampa won’t be entering the Guinness Book of Records quite yet however. The Treepedia study is not designed to be comprehensive – it only features 27 cities that MIT researchers selected out of curiosity to see how very different places compare (it has since made its code freely available online so others can calculate their own city’s tree coverage).However, it reflects a growing awareness of the value of urban trees. City-dwellers have always appreciated tree cover, a fact recognised in the premium prices for properties on tree-lined streets and those adjacent to leafy parks. As the world becomes both hotter and increasingly urbanised, the importance of trees for both climate regulation and personal wellbeing is increasingly well-recognised.“We are seeing a surge in attention around urban trees around the world … not just because they are beautiful, but because cities realise that trees are an important part of resiliency, health, wellness, happiness, economic benefit – the list goes on,” says Dan Lambe, president at the charity Arbor Day, whose Tree City USA initiative has more than 3,400 registered communities.Last year, the scheme went global.One of the main motivations behind the MIT ranking was to ascertain how trees help mitigate the so-called heat island effect in cities.Ranking cities by tree coverage remains an imprecise science, however. The Treepedia study looks at the amount of green pereceived while walking along roads and the green spaces people interact with on a daily basis, rather than measuring the total number of trees. It draws on visual data from Google’s Street View service, which registers trees visible from the tech giant’s roving, camera-laden vehicles. Meanwhile, a new, as yet unpublished, study takes a completely different approach to measuring tree canopy and arrives at very different conclusions. However, Simone Borelli, an urban forestry expert at the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), cautions against focusing too much on absolute figures. Access to trees, not their quantity, is what really matters, he argues. Can city-dwellers sense, see or, ideally, touch the trees in their city?Germany excels in this respect, with three in four urban residents living within 300 metres of a leafy green space – and in Frankfurt, the average drops to a remarkable 99 metres.Frankfurt was even named European City of Trees in 2014 in recognition of the care it takes of its trees. It has around 200,000 of them in public spaces, as well as Frankfurt City Forest, which covers around 5,800 hectares in the south of the city and is protected from being used for infrastructure projects or buildings. It is part of the city’s so-called Grüngürtel (“green belt”), situated in the middle of the metropolitan area, consists of woodland, agricultural areas, gardens, parks, sports areas, orchards and nature reserves.Mayor of Frankfurt Peter Feldmann said: “The importance of the Grüngürtel for the people of Frankfurt is such that the city council decided unanimously to protect it from building development back in November 1991. We are very proud of that fact. This provision was made possible because the city of Frankfurt owns two thirds of the total 8000 ha surface of the Grüngürtel.”But what makes tree coverage in the these forested cities higher than in others?Clearly, climatic conditions exert a huge influence. All but two of the Forest Services’ top-10 forested cities, for example, are in locations propitious for tree growth. The exceptions are Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Buenos Aires in Argentina, both of which occupy grassland-like geographies.But putting tree planting and management high on a city’s policy agenda is equally important, argues Dr Leong Chee Chiew, commissioner of parks and recreation, National Parks Board (NParks), in Singapore. “Singapore is today well regarded internationally for our clean and green living environment. This is the result of over five decades of conscientious planning and commitment at greening our city-state, starting from the very early years of our nation-building.”Provision for greenery is built into the city’s development plans so the number of trees and green spaces increase in tandem with urbanisation, he adds. For example, when a road is being planned there’s a requirement for verges to be set aside for tree planting.There are about 7 million trees in Singapore, approximately 3 million of which are along streets, in parks, residential and industrial estates. And NParks has stepped up efforts in recent years by planting more than 50,000 trees a year along roadsides, and in parks and gardens.“This sustained effort in greening has made Singapore a biophilic City in a Garden, with an environment that improves the overall physiological and psychological well-being of all Singaporeans,” says Chee Chiew.Even in densely populated or climatically unfavourable locations, prioritising trees can go a long way. The FAO’s Borelli points to the example of Milan, where the city’s main polytechnic is spearheading a drive to plant 3 million trees between now and 2030 – one for each resident of the city’s metropolitan area.Such en masse planting trees comes at a high price. China is ploughing millions of dollars into its Beautiful China reforestation policy. However, urban trees can be sacrificed to other pressures facing city authorities.The US city of Atlanta (still referred to as a “city in a forest”) was stripped of around 560,000 acres of trees between 1973 and 1999 to make way for houses, roads and retail parks, leading to localised spikes in temperature and smog.Another case in point, environmentalists argue, is the proposed £88bn fast-rail HS2 project in Britain. In September, green campaign groups called on the pending clearance of ancient woodlands to be paused until the results of an independent review are published.“HS2 has already destroyed dozens of ancient London plane trees and priceless green spaces,” the broadcaster and campaign spokesperson Chris Packham said. “It’s an insane act of eco-vandalism.”﻿Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3e81d067e7ae6ff3d12a0384c0d86a0bd717ad5/0_337_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd4adef886adf378bc3fcc062f2f97f2","title":"brexit election british politics","story":"British politics has created a situation so toxic that the public cannot bear to look at itThe Conservatives have been in government for nine years, but Boris Johnson seems not to feel the weight of that incumbency. He is seeking his first national mandate as prime minister, so doesn’t see himself as a shop-soiled candidate. But he is asking voters to return his party to office for a third time, and it wasn’t much loved to begin with.Labour has the opposite problem. There is plenty of hunger for a new direction in government, but the appetite is dulled by the sight of Jeremy Corbyn asking to be prime minister. It is risky to serve a dish that the electorate has sent back to the kitchen once already.Both of the biggest parties are trying to sell messages of renewal with messengers who are familiar and unpopular. Polls give the Tories a head start, but there is wind behind the opposition in a campaign when even the government admits it is time for a change.Johnson’s claim to be the candidate for a fresh start is contained tenuously in his promise of a swift end to the Brexit saga. He would implement his deal and a burden would thus be lifted from the nation’s shoulders. The prime minister argues that Labour’s policy is to avoid having a policy, deferring the choice, prolonging the pain, which is true enough. The brighter the spotlight on Corbyn’s fence-sitting, the wobblier Labour look.But Johnson has a tricky job selling his plan while also trying to insulate it from scrutiny. He wants people to know there is a deal, but not to care what is in it. There is a flaw in the strategy that makes Brexit the central issue, while running on a platform that appeals to public weariness with the topic. That problem feeds back into the incumbency issue. There is something dissonant in a campaign that says vote for me so we can end this nightmare that I told you would be brilliant vote for the Tories to move on from the only thing Tories seem to care about. Hardline Conservative Eurosceptics have so much pent-up revolutionary frustration, they think they haven’t even started yet. That blinds them to the possibility that the public are tired of having them around.A six-week campaign is long enough for those contradictions to show, especially with Nigel Farage flapping around drawing attention to them. His claim that Johnson’s deal does not effect a clean enough break is ridiculous – it is a severe separation – but the Brexit party had nowhere to go but harder still. And its target audience has been groomed by Tory radicals to feel betrayed by anything that postpones the gratifying instant of rupture. Already Johnson is being tested on post-Brexit transitional arrangements. He says they won’t have to be extended beyond December 2020.They will. A free-trade agreement with Brussels cannot be negotiated by the end of next year. The going rate is more like five years. Under Johnson’s plan, a miserably familiar landscape sweeps into view: Brexiteers pretending something impossible is easy, ruling out compromise and denouncing as traitors any who counsel delay. Meet the new rows over Europe, same as the old ones.The Liberal Democrats have correctly identified article 50 revocation as the efficient way to settle the technical question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it is not something any government likely to be formed after this election could reasonably do, as Jo Swinson must know. The politics of aborting Brexit are as gruesome as the economics of going through with it. There is no good outcome now, only different routes to realising that it was a stupid idea in the first place.With a sustained display of incompetence, cowardice, delusion and ideological mania, British politics has created a situation so monstrous and writhing with venom that the public cannot bear to look at it. Brexit is like the mythical Gorgon that turns to stone all who meet its gaze. It must instead be stalked indirectly, using the monster’s reflection in their polished shield.That is why the election will be only obliquely about Brexit. It will not feature rational evaluation of Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe. These campaigns never do. The referendum drove big red and blue buses down every social fault line in the country without arriving at a functional definition of Brexit. The 2017 election was more animated by fox-hunting and dementia care than customs unions and regulatory alignment. Even when politics appears to be about Brexit, it conspires to be about something else: jostling for position in a Tory leadership race pro-remain guerrilla manoeuvres in the remote hills of Commons procedure.With parliament dissolved, anything relating to the substance of negotiation in Brussels will fall off the agenda because it is a boring subject for most voters and always has been. Meanwhile, neither of the two candidates to be prime minister is going to offer an honest appraisal of why leaving has been so difficult and why it brings no material benefit to the country.There will be ample talk of something called Brexit, but that word will continue to be a proxy for grievances only tangentially connected to EU membership. Or it will be a tint on the lens through which other issues – the NHS, crime, education – will be projected. If British politics was capable of sustaining a focus on the banal reality of continental integration it would have happened by now. And of all the climates in which to cultivate measured debate on the subject, a frenzied, polarised election campaign is the least hospitable. We will get to the end of it and, whatever the result, the monstrous tangle of ugly Brexit choices will still be there. The Gorgon will not be slain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f677d42c059848433f6801a3a15b5b51881ea11/0_122_5778_3467/master/5778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbc569d87b20d1b13916aecae6b27670","title":"michael gove tweets election","story":"One thing that separates 90s kids (me) from the shallow and terrifying TikTok generation, who know how the wifi works on their iPad without having to Google it on their phone first (anyone born this millennium), is that they don’t have the same inbuilt expectation that America is always exactly one season ahead of where we are.Take Friends, for instance. Americans, with their two-litre cans of soda and lurid neon corn snacks, knew about Joey and Rachel kissing months before we knew about Joey and Rachel kissing they went through the boom-and-bust cycle of loving then hating the Ross’s pet monkey storyline a full half-year before we did. And it wasn’t just TV: they were ahead on trends and fashions, and cool phrases and new kinds of inline skates and limited edition Pogs. America, we thought, was the future and Britain, we figured, was the slow-moving past.This has changed. Thanks to streaming and always-on digital culture and slickly maintained piracy websites and 24-hour news and Twitter, we know things at the same time that America knows things, we watch things concurrently with them, and we all got disappointed by the Game of Thrones finale at the exact same time. Where America once trendsat, we now straddle alongside, tucked up in the nook between the neck and the shoulder, nuzzling in.So now we’ve caught up it’s high time for our first yee-haw, hometown-style America-inflected election, and by that I mean we are ripe for a too-online campaign dominated by brief flashes of trending topics, banana-skin troll accounts slipping up previously unknown elected officials, probably some accusations of Russian interference – and, most importantly, outlandishly brash lies being tweeted out in earnest then rigorously fact-checked in seconds by dedicated teams of reply guys. And, obviously, Michael Gove was first to kick things off.If you don’t spend the several hours of last weekend looking at Michael Gove’s Twitter account, I’ll catch you up: on Sunday night Gove got drawn in by what looked, smelled and tasted a lot like a troll account claiming to be a Momentum member (100 or so followers, inexplicable string of random numbers in the account name, Palestine flag emoji, display name that didn’t quite match the actual name, that sort of thing) that was blasting out antisemitism under a #JC4PM hashtag, using the name “Joe Woods”. Gove saw the tweet and called out leading members of the vocal left, imploring them to root out antisemitism in their party and using the Joe Woods account as an exemplar. They all pointed out that Joe Woods almost certainly didn’t exist Momentum itself confirmed Joe Woods didn’t have a membership. Gove doubled down once, then doubled down again somehow and demanded they solve antisemitism by, ironically, quote-tweeting antisemitism and blasting it out to the 133,000 or so followers he has on Twitter. Can someone stop this antisemitism I keep spreading, please? Would be really good if that could get that looked at cheers.Debacles like this are bad (obviously) but good (bear with me) for setting the overall tone of the election to come, which I think we all admit, much like a New Years’ Eve party, needs a theme to really get going. Previous elections have had themes, or at least an rough idea: Brexit for the last one, debates for the one before that, tuition fees and bigoted women before that, \u0026ampc, \u0026ampc, \u0026ampc. The theme for the big bad election of 2019 is, at this early stage, leaning towards “theatrical misinformation”, and a lot of that is to do with how the internet has turned into a beautiful precision tool to make high-profile figures embarrass themselves by not really knowing how to use it – but persistently using it anyway.Gove isn’t the first one to get suckered in, at a point, I must remind you, that is barely a week into the election cycle.The Change UK MP Mike Gapes, a man with the defeated air of a coach driver having his keys tossed round by laughing teenagers at a motorway service station, somehow got conned into endorsing a mock tactical voting website that recommended voting for Mike Gapes in every constituency.Meanwhile – and I barely know how to explain this – the BBC politics live editor Rob Burley and many of his too-online blue-tick friends got suckered in by an #FBPE parody account that accused him of manufacturing an audience plant on Question Time which included cutting a young Tory fox hunter’s hair “to make him look like a regular working-class youngster” – a claim so bizarre and amazing it was bound to go viral. The fallout was predictable: Burley firmly asserting that he didn’t work on Question Time suggestions that he take legal action against the parody account some legitimate hand-wringing from ultra-ironic leftwing shitposters about the fine grey line between wilful misinformation, lighthearted joking that becomes serious the second someone falls for it, and the constant need to be sincere in case we get carried away and accidentally vote for Brexit. When it’s day two of an election and BBC staff are already having to deny forcibly giving haircuts, you know we’re in for a good one.This was a tone-setting week in leading figures falling for things online, and frankly a banner one, too. Thought it was bad when we were all getting tricked by that big red bus, didn’t we? But three years later, and somehow everything is worse. There will be – and mark my words as if I were a witch on a moor making a blood promise that you will be king – mark my words: there will be much, much, much more of this to come.A running theme in The Discourse so far is the classic “should 16-year-olds be allowed to vote YN?” – which seems more pertinent then ever, when such a vast swath of the Brexit voting public has conspired to die of old age before it even got delivered. It’s the same back and forth as ever, really: on one side, people pointing out that 16-year-olds can marry, work, leave home and join the army, so why not vote on the other hand, furious parents pointing out that their son is still asleep at 2pm, that’s why. I don’t personally think that drinking a Red Bull for breakfast and having an Xbox Gold account should preclude anyone from voting, but I am enjoying parents very literally selling their own children out as idiots for Twitter clout, so it’s hard to say really which side is good or bad.• Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant.

Not enough is being done to protect academic freedom from financial, political and diplomatic pressure.”The committee highlighted the role of China-funded Confucius Institutes officials in confiscating papers that mentioned Taiwan at an academic conference, the use of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association as an instrument of political interference and evidence that dissidents active while studying in the UK, such as Ayeshagul Nur Ibrahim, an Uighur Muslim, were being monitoring and her family in China being harassed.The committee accuses some academic organisations, such as Million Plus, which represents 20 modern universities, of complacency.Bill Rammell, the chair of Million Plus, told the committee he had “not heard one piece of evidence” that substantiated claims of foreign influence in universities.The committee said the government’s focus was on protecting universities from intellectual property theft and risks arising from joint research projects. “This is not enough to protect academic freedom from other types of interference such as financial, political or diplomatic pressure,” the MPs said.The Foreign Office’s evidence to the committee highlighted the lack of government advice to universities, the report says, adding ministers have not coordinated approaches to the issue, either within Whitehall or with foreign governments such as Australia and the US.The report points out that a 2019 international education strategy white paper mentions China more than 20 times in the context of boosting education expertise to the Chinese market, but with no mention of security or interference.The committee concluded: “The battle for university students or trade deals should not outweigh the international standards which have brought freedom and prosperity to the UK and the wider world. The government should provide any strategic advice to universities and not used its key sanction tools such as ‘Magnitsky powers’ to curb interference on human rights grounds.”Ministers can curb interference through the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act passed 17 months ago, the report said.However, ministers previously told the committee they could not use the so-called Magnitsky amendment, contained in the act, until the UK had left the EU. In June the FCO finally admitted this interpretation was legally incorrect, and the powers could be used independently of the EU while still an EU member.The FCO has still to lay the necessary statutory instrument to introduce the power, 17 months after the act became law. The foreign affairs select committee pointed out that the power, touted by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in pre-Conservative party conference interviews, will be delayed still further by the general election.The committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, also asked the FCO to explain its failure to use sanctions in response to repression by state authorities in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.On the question of Hong Kong, where violent protests continue and local elections are due to be held later this month, the committee has urged the government to assess the reputational damage to the UK of British judges continuing to sit on the Hong Kong court of final appeal. The committee warns there is a danger of the UK appearing to be complicit in supporting and participating in a system that is undermining the rule of law.In a bid to support the protesters, the UK should grant residency to Hong Kong citizens who are British national (overseas) passport holders, the report said.Tugendhat said hard-won freedoms were under threat in the UK. The FCO had been “found wanting in three policy areas: autocracies’ influence on academic freedom the use of sanctions against autocratic states and their supporters, and the UK’s cooperation with other democracies in responding to autocracies”.An FCO spokesperson said: “The UK is a passionate defender of democracy and the rules-based international system, showing leadership on issues from climate change to media freedom. When we leave the EU, we will set our own sanctions regime and hold to account those who commit serious abuses of human rights.“We will look at this report closely as we continue to bolster our efforts to promote and uphold our democratic values.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7e9da152f94cb8a62f06044dec3bf5ccf3b4985/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=484d21f8537c844d5080889f46bf6d56","title":"new zealands bird of the year 2019 the most important election aside from the real one","story":"What started as innocuous good fun has evolved into a national obsession, complete with voter fraud, skulduggery and high passionsThe data team picked up on them first – 310 “dubious” votes from an IP address in Australia, sending one trend line suddenly, suspiciously skyward above the others. Something funny was going on with the shag.Of course, by then – the 13th year of the competition – organisers knew to expect dodgy dealings in New Zealand’s bird of the year poll.If a nationwide vote to name a favourite native bird sounds like innocuous good fun – a creative means of celebrating unique, threatened fauna – you may be underestimating bird of the year. Coordinated by the Royal Forest \u0026amp Bird Society, an environmental nongovernmental organisation, it is often described as the country’s most important election – second only to, you know, the actual elections. Since 2017, too, it has had the same validation as two other Kiwi creations, pavlova and Russell Crowe: Australia has tried to pass it off as its own.From a total of 900 votes received (some by post) in the first vote in 2005, bird of the year has grown to about 28,000 in 2015 and more than 48,000 in 2018 – nearly double the number that just elected the mayor of Wellington.For this year’s competition, voting has been changed to proportional representation, allowing five choices, owing to persistent feedback that it was “too hard for people to choose just one bird”, according to a Forest \u0026amp Bird spokeswoman, Megan Hubscher. “We’re seeing some interesting campaign strategies starting to take shape around that as well – for example, the penguin species are grouping together to campaign for ‘five ticks to penguins’.”As in politics, electioneering has become more advanced. Each bird has a campaign manager or team, who stop at nothing to give their species the edge. In the past there have been Tinder profiles (for the black stilt), tattoos (of the saddleback) and celebrity endorsements (by Stephen Fry and Bill Bailey, for the kākāpō and the takahē).Team Kereru promised to “govern for the many”, while Jacinda Ardern – who had backed the black petrel or tāiko, “the bogan of birds” – accepted the outcome of the democratic process with dignity. A seabird is yet to win bird of the year.Another underdog is the banded dotterel or pohowera, a skittish little plover, for which George Hobson of Wellington has served as campaign manager since 2015, when he was 11 years old. His campaign was “pretty average” back then, he admits, winning just under 150 votes this year he has been directly contacting businesses, NGOs, “basically as many people as I can” to ask for their support. His highest profile supporter so far is the former PM and UN development programme head Helen Clark.Hobson, now 16, says a vote for the nationally vulnerable “underbird” is a vote for ersity: “Out of the 14 bird of the year winners we’ve had, eight of them have had names beginning with the letter ‘k’ – so we really need to change it up a little bit. And we’re playing a reasonably fair and straightforward campaign – compared to some others.”Not every bird plays by the rules – the black-billed gull ran a notoriously foul-mouthed campaign in 2017, calling the kiwi “a fat flightless fuck” – and the competition is reliably derailed by voter fraud. In 2018 the shag was among 16 species to be boosted by fraudulent votes. In 2017 someone in Christchurch used a random email address generator to lodge 112 votes for the white-faced heron. (The black-billed gull called it racist.)And in 2015 hundreds of illegal votes for the North Island kokako sent it briefly to first place, before the bird’s campaign manager nobly reported foul play. The culprits, two sisters in Auckland, were later identified by their apologetic father.“I actually think we were mostly impressed that two teenagers went to the effort of hacking the system for their favourite bird,” says Kimberley Collins, then competition coordinator. “We were like, ‘Hey, maybe don’t do it again – but good on you for caring so much.’”Collins, a freelance science communicator, managed bird of the year for four years and remembers it fondly as a “stressful time”.This is her first year not formally involved, though she is backing the hoiho, the yellow-eyed penguin. “And one of our campaign values is we don’t heckle other birds, because we think other birds are awesome.”The passion – and occasional skulduggery – is a testament to that personal connection that most New Zealanders feel to their native birds, Collins says: “There’s a bit of friendly heckling but also a lot of support, because we’re all people who care desperately about our native birds, and We don’t want to see any extinctions in our lifetimes.”In the absence of any large native mammals – there are two species of bat that, by and large, fail to capture public imagination – New Zealand’s idiosyncratic birdlife serve as its best known and loved symbols of its unique bioersity. Some New Zealanders would even have their namesake bird on the national flag, as was memorably established in the 2015 referendum.The challenge for bird of the year, Collins says, has been striking the balance between keeping it fresh and fun for the public – “but also catering for the bird nerds who get, um, quite caught up in it”.A teenager once sent her a spreadsheet of every bird species and subspecies from New Zealand, the Chatham Islands and the sub-Antarctic islands. There were more than 200 – not practicable for an online poll.Another voter emailed Collins “multiple times, absolutely furious” at the inclusion of the pukeko because the swamphen species is also found in Australia. The nation’s enthusiasm for its endemic wildlife is not always matched by efforts to understand or protect it. A 2016 Lincoln University study found that the perception of native species’ condition is largely adequate to good. Yet a report by the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services  this year found that more than 4,000 animals and birds were at risk of extinction.The serious side to bird of the year is engaging the public in the breadth of New Zealand’s birdlife, beyond species that appear on the banknotes – as well as the challenges they face. For Hobson, staring down his fifth campaign year, he admits: “I’d quite like to see a banded dotterel win” – and with the former PM’s backing, the chances of the “small little brown birds that run around our beaches” have never been better. “If we can connect people with our beautiful birds, then that’s almost a gateway for them to start caring more about conservation,” he says.Collins agrees that a passion for birds can lead on to an interest in the rest of New Zealand’s flora and fauna. The New Zealand Plant Conservation Network already runs plant of the year, she notes.“I’ve always personally been a big advocate for bat of the year, because it would be so easy to run,” she says. “Two bats. One tick.”• Voting is at birdoftheyear.org.nz.

Italian fashion house Gucci announced it would go fur-free in 2017 and auction off all its remaining animal fur items. In 2018, London fashion week became the first of the big fashion events to commit to banning fur. When Prada announced it would stop using fur in its collections in May, activists hoped the move would reignite a campaign that had taken its foot off the pedal. Most recently, Macy’s announced it would stop selling fur items by February 2021, making it the biggest US retailer to do so, and last month California became the first US state to ban animal fur products.Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society International, called the Queen’s decision to “go faux” from now on “the perfect reflection of the mood of the British public, the vast majority of whom detest cruel fur, and want nothing to do with it”.Her Majesty is no stranger to fur – she wore leopard-skin stoles in the 1950s and attended the opera draped in fur in the 40s.Peta used the news to call on the Queen to rethink the fur worn by members of the Queen’s Guard and “complete the policy by ordering that the fur be replaced by the humane, luxurious faux bearskin that Peta has helped develop alongside faux-furrier Ecopel and designer Stella McCartney”. The Humane Society International called on the government to make the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of fur.Kelly’s book has also brought to light claims that the royal dresser wears in the Queen’s shoes before engagements, “to ensure they are comfortable and that she is always good to go” that the Queen requested to say the line “Good evening, Mr Bond” when she appeared alongside Daniel Craig during the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012, and that she was very happy to share a hug  with Michelle Obama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afaea9f9d89ec2222e81675bae8b5128d714319f/723_284_3890_2335/master/3890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a17446876512bad6988e568e6ecf51b1","title":"colin farrell penguin the batman talks","story":"The actor is in negotiations to join Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano in a neo-noir take on the DC superheroColin Farrell is in negotiations with Warner Bros to play the Penguin opposite Robert Pattinson’s Batman.According to Deadline, the actor could be returning to the comic book world for the first time since his role as Bullseye in 2003’s Daredevil. In the new interpretation, called The Batman, Pattinson will play the Caped Crusader as a detective in a neo-noir take on the character.“His morality is a little bit off. He’s not the golden boy, unlike almost every other comic-book character,” Pattinson said about the character to the New York Times. “There is a simplicity to his worldview, but where it sits is strange, which allows you to have more scope with the character.”The Cloverfield director Matt Reeves is behind the project which has also recently secured Paul Dano as the Riddler, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman and Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon. Today it was also revealed that Andy Serkis is in talks to play Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne’s butler previously brought to the screen by Michael Caine in Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy.“What’s exciting about Batman is how it relates to now and also how personal it can be,” Reeves told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. “It’s very much a point-of-view-driven, noir Batman tale. It’s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it’s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional.”Farrell was last seen in Disney’s live-action Dumbo and next year he stars alongside Matthew McConaughey in Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen and sci-fi drama After Yang.Production on The Batman is set to start late this year or early 2020 with a 2021 release date.

The Champions League holders are within touching distance of the knockout stages again and will appreciate every opportunity to finish the job early given the workload ahead.Liverpool moved top of the group courtesy of another fine goal against Genk from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, his fourth in four games, and Napoli’s failure to beat Salzburg. They can secure progress with a game to spare by beating Carlo Ancelotti’s side at Anfield later this month.That may be asier said than done but, having gone 24 European home games unbeaten, Klopp’s team will have the confidence and, given their December fixture list, the incentive to tick off another priority for the season before travelling to Salzburg for the final group game.This was a mundane contest and routine victory, delivered by Georginio Wijnaldum’s early improvised finish and Oxlade-Chamberlain’s second-half winner. The Belgium champions retained hope of securing a draw until the end owing to Liverpool’s inability to kill off the game. Alisson’s important save from Bryan Heynen nine minutes from time ensured they did not.Mundane was just fine for Klopp. Winning with a much changed team, with key players rested and without any injuries before Manchester City’s hugely significant visit in the Premier League on Sunday, was, as he put it, job done.The Liverpool manager, who deployed Oxlade-Chamberlain in the Roberto Firmino role between Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi, said: “It was clear it would be a bit tricky in some departments because the front three never played together in these positions or in a formation like this. We wanted to have Ox between the lines, give him the space to turn and run at the last line with options right and left. That worked pretty well sometimes and we could have scored more often.“The longer the game goes, the more the momentum goes to the other team if you don’t finish your situations off. ‘Job done’ is the headline for the game, pretty much, but the group is not decided. It’s a tough group. We are first in the table but we want to be first after the last match day and now we have to play two tough games, and two important ones.”Liverpool’s task and the spectacle were complicated by the more conservative approach that Genk adopted compared with their 4-1 defeat when the teams met in Belgium two weeks ago. Felice Mazzu’s side suffered their fifth domestic defeat of the season at lowly Eupen at the weekend. That reverse, coupled with a punishing start to their European campaign, prompted a five-man defence at Anfield as the Genk manager sought to restore confidence and solidity in his ranks.“We took a risk by coming here to play the best team in the world with a new system and without having time to work on it on the pitch, so I am very proud of the players,” Mazzu said.Liverpool prospered down Genk’s right flank in the first half with James Milner almost as potent creatively as the man he replaced at left-back, Andy Robertson. Origi, who started his career at Genk, was involved in the breakthrough when he released Milner down the left. There was an appeal for offside but the veteran had timed his run to perfection. A low cross driven across the goalmouth struck Carlos Cuesta and his fellow defender Sébastian Dewaest before dropping into the run of Wijnaldum, who hooked the ball into the roof of the net from close range.The European champions maintained the pressure and dominance of possession but lacked the clinical touch to put the game beyond Genk. Gaëtan Coucke saved well with his legs from Naby Keïta after a surging run by Oxlade-Chamberlain gave the midfielder a clear shot. Both Salah and Origi dragged decent opportunities wide of Coucke’s left-hand post when free inside the box.Genk had offered nothing as an attacking threat for the opening 40 minutes. Almost inevitably they equalised from their first meaningful attack. Trent Alexander-Arnold showed good awareness to prevent Ally Mbwana Samatta connecting with an inviting cross from Joakim Maehle by flicking the ball out for a corner. From the resulting delivery by Heynen, Samatta expertly timed his run between Oxlade-Chamberlain and Milner to send a thumping header past Alisson at the near post.Genk’s belief soared but, as in Belgium, they were tormented by Oxlade-Chamberlain when he was found inside the area by Salah’s intelligent lay-off. The England international shaped to turn with his back to goal, Maehle bought it and looked on aghast as the midfielder used the space he had created for himself to drive a low finish beyond Coucke.

Jürgen Klopp indicated the decision was made under pressure but was the least problematic solution available.Klopp had threatened to withdraw Liverpool from the competition over a fixture clash with the Club World Cup and dismissed the idea of playing different teams in the competitions only on Friday. Liverpool have since requested the game at Villa Park takes place as planned on Tuesday 17 December – the day before their first game of the Club World Cup in Qatar. The EFL announced on Tuesday it had agreed to the proposal to avoid disruption to the semi-final stages, the FA Cup and future Premier League matches.Asked whether Liverpool had come under pressure from Fifa or the EFL to accept the unprecedented schedule, Klopp replied: “Kind of. Do you want me to be really in trouble with Fifa? No. Do we want to be in trouble with the EFL? Probably not. You only play the Club World Cup if you win the Champions League and that doesn’t happen in your life five million times. You have to take the opportunity.”Liverpool have been in talks with the EFL for several months. The European champions have given a commitment to the EFL to field a team in the quarter-finals “that is largely consistent with those that have participated in earlier rounds of this season’s competition” and meets the competition’s selection requirements.Klopp handed five youngsters their home debuts in the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal in the fourth round but also started players who would be expected to feature in Qatar – James Milner, Divock Origi, Joe Gomez, Naby Keïta, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Adam Lallana.Liverpool could field a similar side at Villa and fly first-team regulars to Qatar afterwards for their second CWC game on 21 December. No final decisions have been made on the composition of Klopp’s squads or on whether the manager will oversee both matches, although that is unlikely.The EFL’s football services director, Dave Cookson, said: “The EFL has long acknowledged this competition provides those clubs with large resources with the opportunity to rotate their squads knowing that teams who wish to be successful have to be prepared to play a large amount of matches over the course of the season.“Therefore, in these exceptional circumstances the decision was taken having received clear assurances from the club that there will be a level of consistency in team selection, a feature which is key to ensuring integrity is maintained. We recognise the challenges Liverpool face in this matter and appreciate the efforts made to find a practical solution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5fe2369102ab3d9b5116fca70b90c457961a42e/76_39_5319_3192/master/5319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efc6a026cffddc68790075d2cd1b38ed","title":"chelsea soul youth ajax champions league","story":"Ajax were majestic and fearless – even with nine men – but Chelsea’s comeback shows something is stirringKids, huh? Midway through the second half on a chilly, boisterous, increasingly wild night at Stamford Bridge this game simply fell apart.Best perhaps just to stick to the numbers. With 62 minutes gone Ajax had no fans, 11 players and a three‑goal lead. With 71 minutes gone Ajax had nine players and no lead. They still had no fans. Chelsea had scored two own goals and two penalties. Chelsea had played four at the back (terribly) and then three at the back (progressively). And the score, somehow, was 4-4 as it would stay, somehow, until the end.The match had passed through at least two distinct eras. First was the age of well-grooved Ajax dominance, the pass-and-move incision that took them to a 4-1 lead. After that came the witching hour, that breath of post-Halloween mischief when suddenly the air began to crackle, the moon shone a strange shade of blue and this wholehearted Chelsea team took the game by the throat.It was, above all, a brilliantly entertaining spectacle. Chelsea had taken 22 shots at goal and really should have won. But Ajax were thrillingly reckless too. With nine men on the pitch after Daley Blind and Joël Veltman had been sent off during The Happening – a blur of fouls, handballs and yellow cards – they kept on pouring forward in search of a winner. It was majestic, fearless and shot through with a wonderful Cruyffian arrogance.And, yes, here is an obvious takedown to all the goodwill generated by Chelsea’s ragged rearguard. The fact is they were taken apart for an hour. Ten minutes before that double sending-off, just before Donny van de Beek’s low shot bulged the Chelsea net to make it 4-1 Frank Lampard could be seen already turning away, a horrible smile on his face.Lampard had watched as Christian Pulisic gave the ball away high up the pitch, as the Chelsea centre-backs, who had played through a mist of confusion all night, left huge untended green spaces inside their own area. Van de Beek had time to take a breath and admire the mist flooding down over the low white roof lights before clipping the ball into the corner.At that stage Chelsea had not just been opened up. They had been shivved and sliced, meat pulled away from the bones. It was a gentle kind of butchery, one that owed quite a lot to the subject on the blood-soaked bench, a Chelsea team intent on helping to lower the knife.There seemed an easy narrative, Chelsea’s enforced, ad hoc youth policy schooled in the realities by the European masters of succession. Ajax became a footballing nursery because of something innate to the Dutch sporting culture, an economic necessity, but also a quasi‑intellectual rigour. Chelsea have gone down a similar route because they got busted for tapping up other clubs’ young players.There are one or two differences there and there were differences on the pitch, too. In the opening 40 minutes Mason Mount and Pulisic completed five passes between them. By half-time the same pair had given the ball to an Ajax shirt 11 times, one fewer then they had managed to their own players.Ajax were too compact, too vigorous, too cute in their movements. Meanwhile Chelsea defended with all the resistance of an overly dunked digestive biscuit, three of the four Ajax goals scored from the kind of spaces that speak to some kind of systems failure, a shutdown, a category mistake.With five minutes gone it was already 1-1. A Quincy Promes free-kick was deflected in, then equalised by a penalty that owed a pre-assist to Mount’s driving run. At which point Ajax began the orderly process of taking the game away, right up until that 11-minute spell of turnaround.What to make of all this? It will be tempting to see in Chelsea’s performance only chaos, weak spots, a loss of control. But this is also to disregard something vital about the way teams work. There has been so much talk this week of Chelsea cranking up the purchasing arm straight away if their transfer ban is overturned. It seems remarkable that a club that has finally found a little soul should risk all that by rushing back out to the market. Or rather, it would if you haven’t been watching for the past 15 years.But there was also something precious on show here. Chelsea gained a point – keeping them level with Ajax – on spirit, warmth and the will to seize the game when the opening came. It might yet come to nothing. Even four points from the final two games could still leave them short of second place. But there was life here, too, for all the raggedness and a sense above all of something taking root."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d4f54ec26ce07113bf54b22b4c3409a12de84b/545_45_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83c43d9b0880fcd9bb5dc97fc6c14f8","title":"frank lampard hails chelsea spirit comeback ajax","story":"• Chelsea were 4-1 down before drawing 4-4• Lampard: ‘The players really pushed tonight and I loved it’Frank Lampard praised Chelsea’s spirit after they fought back from 4-1 down to claim a point against Ajax and keep their hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League alive on a dramatic night at Stamford Bridge.Chelsea were outplayed for long spells by the Dutch champions and were on their way to an embarrassing home defeat midway through the second half. Ajax had taken a commanding lead thanks to strikes from Hakim Ziyech and Donny van de Beek and own-goals from Kepa Arrizabalaga and Tammy Abraham.Yet César Azpilicueta reduced the deficit and Ajax unravelled, losing both of their centre-backs, Daley Blind and Joël Veltman, to red cards in the move that allowed Jorginho to score his second penalty of the night.Down to nine men, Erik ten Hag’s side cracked when Reece James, Chelsea’s 19-year-old right-back, equalised and they were relieved when Azpilicueta had a potential winner ruled out after VAR spotted a handball by Tammy Abraham.“For a performance like today you need characters and personalities,” Lampard said. “At 3-1 down at half-time, it’s easy to turn it in. Even easier at 4-1. But we never did. I keep saying it about the experienced players. Those players really pushed tonight and I loved it.”There was a mixture of relief and deflation for Lampard at the end. The draw keeps Chelsea level on points with Ajax and Valencia with two games left. Valencia, who thrashed Lille 4-1 in the group’s other game, host Lampard’s side later this month.“I always felt this group was going to be tight,” Chelsea’s manager said. “I felt teams could take points off each other. We’re in it but we certainly have work to do. We need to go to Valencia and Lille come here. Both of those are very tough matches. I felt today we could have won the game and that’s with respect to Ajax because they are a top team. The performances in Lille and at Ajax should give us confidence. Valencia have had a great result tonight and that will give them confidence that they can go through.”Lampard, who lost Mason Mount to an ankle injury during the second half, was impressed with James after he brought the youngster on at half-time. “Reece is a fantastic young player and he gives what you saw,” he said. “He is going to be a great player for this club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2d9aae4fef4272e4b44aac7d99f73f349bfdf/0_173_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a603598092306d6181ed640887ca36","title":"boats burgers and whale bones cambridge for kids","story":"From playgrounds to punts, mazes to museums, animals to afternoon tea, Cambridge is packed with kid-happy things to see, do and eat. Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge.

So if you want the inside scoop on family fun? Talk to an under-10, of course. Six-year-old Londoner Indy Williams – with help from mum Kate Faithfull-Williams – shares her favourite city spotsI love London because it’s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right next to a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie. Look out for the new Thames virtual reality experience by One London Bridge. It’s like a big pair of goggles that lets you see all the wildlife in the Thames, like seahorses, seals and even dolphins and sharks.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van. They do spicy pizzas for grownups too. The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It is a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs. Once I saw a beautiful brown horse.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

It’s a traditional Georgian seaside resort, with an art deco pier (which won Pier of the Year 2019), old-fashioned amusements and ice-cream parlours, a new big wheel and a lovely, long pebbly beach.When the sun shines ...It’s easy for us to get to Worthing from Brighton, but Londoners can get there easily too – the direct train from London Victoria only takes 90 minutes. This year, the Worthing Observation Wheel opened. At 46 metres high, it’s the tallest observation wheel on the south coast, and is open from April to October. While you can’t quite see my house from the top, it has amazing views all along the coast and across the South Downs national park.If you don’t fancy swimming in the sea then go to Splashpoint, a fun leisure centre with slides and a ing pool that is close to the beach.For smaller kids, say eight and under, I recommend The Worthing Lido, a small amusement park with rides like the spinning teacups and the Disney Express train. My brother, sister and I always like playing on the 2p slot machines in the arcade.Is Worthing worth it on a rainy day?We don’t just come to Worthing when it’s sunny. Sometimes I like it more when it’s not, as it means we can go to the Dome Cinema on the seafront. It was called The Kursaal when it opened in 1911 and had a rollerskating rink on the ground floor and a cinema on the top floor. It’s a shame it doesn’t have the rollerskating rink any more, but I like watching films in the old-fashioned auditorium with vintage seats. My mum says it was in the movie Wish You Were Here, which was filmed in Worthing, and there’s lots of old cinema memorabilia in the Projectionist’s Bar.On the way down to the beach, we pass Harold Pinter’s old house, and pop in to the Worthing Museum and Art Gallery. It’s free to enter and has loads of cool stuff, like piles of Roman coins and tools found nearby at Cissbury Ring, an iron age fort. I like the 19th- and 20th-century clothes they have on display – Mum always swoons over the sparkly Chanel dress from the 1930s. But my favourite bit is the cabinet of swimming costumes throughout the years. I think it’s crazy that people back then used to wear knitted bathers!Getting hungry?While I’m happy with candy floss and ice-cream, the folks insist on having something more substantial when we visit Worthing. The Beach House on the seafront is one of my favourite places. Located between the pier and the Dome, it has a sunny terrace overlooking the beach and serves posh burgers, lots of vegan and vegetarian things (for my veggie sister) and local craft beer for thirsty parents.If we don’t want to leave the beach, Mum will order a takeaway from Pizzaface, a cool Brighton pizza shop that has just opened in Worthing. They also like CrabShack, another little restaurant by the sea that serves fresh crab and zingy cockle popcorn. But for a special meal try Pitch on Warwick Street, which is run by local chef Kenny Tutt, the winner of MasterChef 2018.Old-fashioned seaside treatsWhen I was younger, I loved riding a quadracycle, one of those big four-wheeled bikes with a stripy roof, along the seafront. But now I’m 13, it’s become a bit embarrassing to ride one with your parents!One thing I’ll never grow out of, though, is a knickerbocker glory from Macari’s, a cafe and ice-cream parlour on the seafront that’s retro inside. Apparently it’s been open for nearly 60 years, and has always been run by the same family. Mum says the knickerbocker glory still tastes the same as when she was a kid.It’s about a 15-minute walk from Macari’s back to the train station, just in time to catch one of the regular trains back home to Brighton.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets with Southern (T\u0026ampCs apply).

But does it help men find their dream mate - or just encourage street harassment?In an upmarket bar near Oxford Circus in London, I am watching two men hit on women with all the desperation of a doomed cavalry charge. But without the heroism.Mike and Raj (not their real names) circle the bar, scanning for women, drinks held at an awkward right angle to their chests. When they identify a target, they approach. The women stiffen, their smiles tightening. They swirl drinks with straws and chit-chat politely before mentioning boyfriends – real or imagined. The men retreat, regroup, identify fresh women. Advance, engage, retreat. On and on it goes.I’m standing with the man coordinating this operation, the British pickup artist Johnny Cassell, as he watches as Mike and Raj – his students – run drills. Tonight is the culmination of Cassell’s intensive, day-long “Impactful Connection” workshop. For £700, Cassell promises to help men “master the art of attracting the women you truly want”. But watching as Mike and Raj hit on women indiscriminately,  it looks as if any women will do.It has been a long and disturbing day. Arriving at the venue, a four-star Mayfair hotel that morning, I had found Cassell, 31, in a black mood: a client had just dropped out. Tall and handsome, with a wolfish air, Cassell switches between being charming and cold. He does not like being contradicted or mocked. At one point during the session, I joke about spreadsheets and GDPR violations. Cassell is visibly displeased.For the uninitiated, pickup artists (PUAs) are typically men – female artists are much rarer – who attempt to coax women into having sex with them through a mixture of flattery, psychological manipulation and coercion. The movement has a surprisingly long pedigree, dating back to Eric Weber’s now almost 50-year-old manual How to Pick Up Girls. Today, this seems relatively sedate stuff. Weber writes, “the most important tenet of a pick up is that it’s mutual … Women are entitled to say ‘no’, plain and simple.” But the community really exploded into the public consciousness with the publication of Neil Strauss’s 2005 international bestseller The Game, which sold 2.5m copies. It introduced a generation of men to the murky, underhand world of pickup artists and their nefarious tactics, such as negging – insulting a woman to undermine her confidence, and make her feel as if she has to seek your approval – or peacocking, where you dress flamboyantly as a talking point to hit on women. I went to university two years after The Game was published, and watched its influence spread like a virus through the men in my year: I don’t think I went on a night out in 2007 without some drunk rugby player trying to “neg” me.What was once an underground community has grown into a seduction industry valued at $100m (£75m). “The basic premise of all seduction teaching and practice is that interactions between men and women are subject to certain underlying principles that, once understood, can be readily manipulated,” explains Dr Rachel O’Neill of Warwick University, the author of Seduction: Men, Masculinity and Mediated Intimacy. “This is an impoverished view of sex and relationships, in which intimacy is less something to be experienced for its own sake and more something to be achieved for other ends.”Attending today’s workshop are Mike, a 31-year-old tech worker, and Raj, 26, who lives in Dubai and works in finance. We sit around a circular table in a panelled conference room. Oil paintings of horses stare down at us. “I’ve been doing this for 14 years,” Cassell says. “It started off as a need for myself. Now I teach other people.”Raj uses PUA terminology abundantly. “I have an issue with approach anxiety,” he says, meaning that he gets nervous hitting on women for the first time. He also refers to “sarging”, the process of picking up women. Both Raj and Mike are (perhaps unsurprisingly) edgy around me. I shunt my chair into a corner and arrange my features into a neutral expression.The workshop begins with Cassell urging Raj and Mike to pick their dream women. Raj favours Kylie Jenner Mike opts for Amber Gill, from Love Island. With the right mindset, Cassell says, they can bring their dream women into existence. He says reassuring if somewhat oblique things such as: “You are not a mass-market product,” and, “If you are getting rejected, you haven’t worked out what you want,” and, “The magic word here is, choose.” (Cassell writes “choose” on the whiteboard.)Pop psychology session over, Cassell teaches them a conversation model. When approaching a woman, they should begin by making an assumption, before using a hook to draw her into conversation. Next they should challenge her, then introduce a time constraint and close the interaction by asking for a phone number. Raj and Mike hunch over their notebooks like dutiful schoolboys.In recent years, Cassell has been describing himself as a dating coach as well as a pickup artist, and avoids the worst excesses of the PUA community, such as sexually coercive tactics. Notorious pickup artist Daryush Valizadeh – known as Roosh V – was accused of advocating legalising rape, on private property, in comments he later said were satirical. The American pickup artist Julien Blanc was banned from entering the UK in 2014, after 157,000 people signed a petition protesting against his visit. Earlier this month, pickup artist Adnan Ahmed – who called himself “Addy A-Game” – was jailed for two years after being convicted of threatening and abusive behaviour. Ahmed would harass women on the streets of Glasgow, causing them distress, and offered tips on his YouTube channel on how to overcome “last-minute resistance to sex”.While his patter is assured, Cassell’s teaching feels to me very similar to the message of Neil Strauss’s seminal pickup bible. At one point, Cassell suggests challenging a woman who is into Crossfit by telling her that Crossfit is for people who aren’t really good at any sport. This appears to be textbook negging.Conversational model learned, it’s now time for what Cassell refers to as fieldwork, but would more accurately be termed street harassment. Thus follow two of the most dispiriting hours of my career, as I walk around central London in the rain, watching as Raj and Mike pester women. They pretend to ask for directions, and after the woman has pointed out the route, say: “Actually I just wanted to talk to you,” or, “You look cute.”At one point, Mike stops two women on Oxford Street and pretends to ask for directions. After they walk on, Cassell sends Mike chasing after them – he is convinced one was being flirtatious, because she crossed her legs while speaking to Mike. (She tells him she has a boyfriend.) Outside Fortnum \u0026amp Mason on Piccadilly, there is a surreal chat about whether the men should approach a young woman shopping with her mother. Cassell decides in favour of it, but by then, thankfully, the women have moved on.As a young woman who has experienced street harassment throughout my life, it is an extraordinarily uncomfortable thing to observe. I know that, on a fundamental level, women do not want to be approached in this way by strangers on the street. Not when they are running errands, or chatting on the phone, or on their way home from work. We want men to leave us alone.But I am here to observe. So I say nothing and we squelch on through the rain. I am struck by the fact that all the women being approached are uniformly young, slim, white – and uniformly polite. They smile and refer to boyfriends, but with the exception of one woman Mike interrupts having a cigarette outside Pret – who looks furious – they do not seem put out. Why don’t any of these women tell Mike and Raj to get lost?“Women are socialised not to challenge men,” explains Dr Bianca Fileborn of the University of Melbourne, an expert in gendered street harassment. “But this response may also be about managing the situation safely.” When you confront a stranger you risk escalating the situation. “You don’t know what’s going to happen next. These are men who’ve already crossed your boundaries … deflecting them, by telling them you have a boyfriend – in effect, saying, ‘I’m the property of another man, please leave me alone’ – can be a strategy for managing the situation.”As we walk, Mike is having an internal tussle. “You do wonder, am I bothering people?” he admits. “Especially with things like #MeToo. But then I think, you’re being nice. You’ve gone up to someone and said they’re attractive.” This message – that the men are doing a good thing, and that women enjoy being hit on in the street – is continually reinforced by Cassell. He urges them on, an officer rallying his troops. “I want you to take that shot. You’re just making someone feel better about themselves.”After Raj is rejected outside Topshop (who knew so many women in central London had boyfriends?), Cassell reassures him he has done nothing wrong. “She’s going to call her friend and say: ‘Oh my God, this guy just hit on me!’ You made her day.” Outside Piccadilly Circus tube station, the cold rain whipping my face, Cassell repeats: “You’re just making someone feel better about themselves. It would be selfish not to.”That’s not true. I think I am witnessing street harassment – something Fileborn makes emphatically clear. “This behaviour has a profoundly negative impact on women. It’s often excused as flirting, or seen as good-natured. And on the inidual incident level, I can understand why you might think that: someone came and spoke to you in the street, what’s the big deal? But for many women, these aren’t one-off experiences, but are repeated constantly, often from childhood. They add up.” She sighs. “I don’t think men live with this experience of being intruded upon and having people feel entitled to your time.”On we walk. I think about the smartly dressed man who said something crude as I was having lunch at a former job. I told him not to talk to me like that. His fury was sudden and total. “Fuck you,” he snarled, as I recoiled in terror. I always remember how quickly the rage came, like it had been there all along. Eventually, we head back to the hotel. As the men write down their aspirations for the future, Cassell, surreally, puts on the score to Inception.We decamp to the hotel restaurant and eat while making stilted conversation. It is not an easy meal for anyone. The men feel that I am judging them. Mike says he thinks men should be physically stronger, so they can protect women, and waits for a response. I chew my food. Cassell tells me about a girlfriend who would prefer to pay a handyman rather than ask him for help. He didn’t like that, he says. It made him feel redundant. “What do you think about that?” Cassell says, fixing me with a cold look. I make a feeble joke.And so, to the bar where the staff know Cassell and don’t seem to mind that he is bringing men into the venue expressly to pester women. For the next three hours, Cassell identifies groups of women. The men trot over obediently. “Try that blonde at the bar,” he tells Raj. “You’d only be adding to her night. She looks bored.” Cassell suggests going up to a woman, saying “Trick or Treat?”, and then holding her wrist. At one point, Cassell sends Mike to sit with two women who are having a quiet drink. “What should I say?” Mike pleads. He is vibrating with nerves.In that moment, I feel sorry for Mike. It is easy to judge these men, but they are painfully introverted and shy – even childlike in the way they look to Cassell for answers. I don’t think they are bad people. But they are denying women the chance to exist in public spaces without being treated as objects of desire. Just to be free, without an imaginary boyfriend or a place you need to be.The night wears on. “I’m not sleazy,” Cassell says, apropos of nothing. My feet hurt and my chest feels tight with emotion. I say goodnight. Raj and Mike look relieved I’m leaving. On and on they circle, men on the prowl."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36751615c8bc3b22ca0fdd3ae64e71f6e821389/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e628a1913427d59623335872d3827f2","title":"the attachment secret are you a secure avoidant or anxious partner","story":"It’s difficult to find lasting love, but by recognising your attachment type you can be more conscious in your relationships and stop self-sabotagingIt was the breakup that changed Amir Levine’s life. Fifteen years ago, he told his partner that he was falling in love with him and wanted them to move forward as a couple. His partner fled, moving across the country. The end of the relationship was especially painful for Levine. At the time he was a student at Columbia University in New York, where he is now assistant professor of clinical psychiatry. He was working in a therapeutic nursery programme, helping mothers with post-traumatic stress bond with their children. Through it, he became fascinated by the science of adult attachment.In the 1950s, the influential British psychologist and psychiatrist John Bowlby observed the lifelong impact of the earliest bonds formed in life, between children and parents, or primary caregivers: attachment theory, which has been widely researched and drawn upon since then. There are three major styles of attachment: secure, anxious and avoidant.When Levine came across attachment theory as a student, no one seemed to have applied it to adult romantic relationships but he immediately saw the relevance to his own heartbreak. His boyfriend had an avoidant attachment style.It was a revelation to Levine now he knew why their relationship hadn’t worked. “It didn’t make it less painful, but I could understand it better. I was surprised that no one had taken those concepts and translated them into something that people could use.”For 15 years, he has been doing just that, at Columbia, in private practice, and as an author. With his friend and fellow psychologist Rachel Heller, Levine wrote Attached, a practical guide to harnessing adult attachment theory to find lasting love, described by its authors as “the manual we wish we’d had when we were dating”. The idea is that by recognising your type you can identify a suitable partner, be more conscious in your relationships and stop self-sabotaging.“It’s not you, it’s my attachment style,” may sound like a gift for commitment-phobes, but the response to Attached suggests it has really helped people, says Levine. First published in 2010, the book has been updated to include stories from readers who found it “a profound relief to discover that their needs for closeness are valid”.There is an assumption that everyone has the “capacity to love in the same way”, says Levine, but our attachment styles act like programming: “It goes much deeper than communication – it affects our perception of the world, without us really knowing it.”Anxiously attached people tend to be overly preoccupied with their partners and whether they love them back, while avoidants equate intimacy with a loss of independence and deploy distancing strategies. (You can find out your type by doing the quiz at AttachedTheBook – if it is not immediately obvious.)Learning about which style they are can change people’s lives, says Levine: “They are stopped from doing the same thing that hasn’t worked for them.”You are not necessarily stuck with your style: according to a four-year study, one in four people do change over time – often as a result of a relationship with someone who has a secure attachment style.Anxious and avoidant types are drawn to each other, despite their incompatible styles: as the person seeking closeness works harder to get it, their avoidant partner pulls away, thus reaffirming their separate beliefs that relationships are unfulfilling or restrictive. Levine’s pop culture example is the film 500 Days of Summer, with Zooey Deschanel’s Manic Pixie Dream Girl character a textbook avoidant.People in anxious-avoidant relationships can change their behaviour with introspection and, often, therapy. Cate Mackenzie, a London-based psychosexual therapist, cites American couples therapist Hedy Schleifer’s turtle-and-octopus theory, in which one is inclined to retreat, the other to reach out. Mackenzie says anxious octopuses can be overly critical of avoidant turtles, who may have internalised shame about avoidance. Her aim is to soften their exchange, by encouraging both partners to open up and better understand each other, “to build a new paradigm”.But, she adds: “Even if one person was more of a turtle in another relationship, it can change – the person with the higher desire becomes the octopus.” Dr Rob Weisskirch, professor of human development at California State University, says attachment theory is a useful tool for understanding nuance in relationships, but it’s also possible to overestimate its importance. It doesn’t necessarily mean you are destined to have bad relationships.“There are plenty of external experiences that can be additive for healthy relationships,” he says. In other words, nothing is set in stone.Attached is mostly geared towards helping people who are still floundering in the dating pool – particularly anxious types, who are more vulnerable. Avoidants are relatively glossed over, Levine admits. “We never thought they were going to read this,” he says. Nevertheless, this avoidant found it an illuminating read.Levine’s dating advice is to be upfront about your needs as predetermined by your type, and to try to identify your potential partner’s type. For example, if you recognise that your anxious attachment style means it is important to you that your partner texts back quickly, make it clear early on. How they respond to a relatively low-stakes request will give you a clue to their own triggers.People tend to go with the flow and find out over time, but that initial stage is crucial, says Levine. “When it’s left up to chance, you’re lucky if you find someone who is nourishing and helpful – if you’re unlucky, you don’t. It’s important to be able to ask for what you need.”The “spark” that guides many people’s decisions doesn’t necessarily indicate long-term compatibility, he says. “And once you start to like the person, and make them special and unique to you, it’s hard to undo it.”The premium placed on a securely attached partner can create its own pressures. Avoidants often distract from promising romantic prospects by fantasising about “the one”, while Mackenzie warns that “high-achieving octopuses”, in particular, can become overly preoccupied with a checklist of traits.Levine is sympathetic to anyone who is struggling to find a partner. “When we are in a relationship we tend to forget how hard it is to be alone, to hope to find someone, to go out on yet another date. Even if you’re the one who is rejecting, dating is a very stressful time.”He and Heller make it clear that our choice of partner powerfully affects our ability to thrive in the world – and that being clear-eyed about your needs in a relationship, and what would make you happy, is the first step towards success.Attached: How the Science of Adult Attachment Can Help You Find – and Keep – Love, by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, is published by Bluebird, £9.99.

Roger Leatham, director of business affairs, referred to the email in a witness statement.In the email Swain wrote: “Jeremy has been pretty understanding and indicated to David that he wants £1,500 (think that’s half his current rate) but hinted that he would probably settle at £1,300. I believe stand-in presenters have been paid £1k and been very happy (easy money as it’s so little work). Let me know if that’s enough ammoinformation to get him to £1,300.”In 2018, the BBC agreed to commission two more series of Points of View, 20 programmes in total, at a lower tariff. The BBC spoke to Vine offering him £1,300 per episode plus employer’s national insurance contribution, which would bring it up to a cost to the BBC of approximately £1,500.The public broadcaster has said it was justified in paying Ahmed less than Vine due to differences between news and entertainment shows. The BBC has argued that Newswatch is a news show which requires different presenter appeal to Points of View, which is an entertainment programme.Simon Miller, the series producer for Points of View, argued against the suggestion that the show required minimal effort, and told the tribunal, “That is not a fair description, and does not reflect Jeremy’s role in the programme.”He added that as a presenter Vine had a “glint in his eye” and in his witness statement said the show had always been a bit “cheeky” and was able to deal with issues in a lighthearted way. When Claire Darwin, representing Ahmed, asked whether Vine was “a bit of a lad”, Miller responded that being cheeky was a personality trait that was not dependent on one sex or another. Anne Robinson, who presented Points of View from 1987 to 1997, “is famous for doing the wink,” Miller added.James Mallet, the series producer at Newswatch, said audiences did not want the personality of a presenter to be introduced in news programmes. “I would not expect that to happen because the feeling amongst the audience is that they want the news and news programmes to be delivered straight and neutral,” he told the tribunal.Earlier on Tuesday, the BBC presenter Emily Maitlis voiced her support for Ahmed. She said: “As somebody who has been in a similar position, my heart goes out to her. I think it’s a really important thing that she’s doing, fighting for other people who’ve got unjust and unequal imbalances.”She added: “Presumably it is a nationwide or an international problem that we’re all trying to understand and get to grips with, and whether we need more transparency or not is clearly the big issue.”Ahmed is suing the public broadcaster for £693,245 in lost earnings over claims of unequal pay. She has told the tribunal that Vine was “gifted” his primetime Radio 2 show by BBC management and handed opportunities that were not available to ambitious female presenters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ada2dfe3dade54af7d5f79494812d6ea78d9ac9/0_247_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03261037a711ef2290b7f16216c5c5d2","title":"gary younge to join manchester university as sociology professor","story":"Award-winning journalist will leave position at the  but continue to write for paperGary Younge, the award-winning  journalist, author and broadcaster, is to join the University of Manchester as a professor of sociology in the school of social sciences.He will leave his position as editor-at-large at the , which he joined in 1993, but continue to write for the organisation.

The second crashed into a field. Both had tumbled from a B-52G Stratofortress after a mid-air refuelling snafu that led to a wing falling off and three of the eight-strong crew dying in the resulting crash. If either of the 3.8 megaton bombs had detonated that day in January 1961, Big Daddy Road in North Carolina would have suffered the equivalent of 250 Hiroshimas.“Given the nature of basic human ineptitude, one question stands out,” said the US comedian sagely, in Rich Hall’s Red Menace (BBC Four), his deadpan history of the cold war. “How did we not blow each other up?”Good question. In hindsight, it is amazing that there are humans around to have hindsight. The bomb in the tree had its arming switch set to “on”. Why didn’t it go off? The faithful of Big Daddy Road had an answer: God used His manual override. Attendance at the local baptist church tripled the year after the incident.Cold war Americans were less likely to kill Soviets with nuclear weapons than themselves, Hall argued. At Los Alamos in 1945, one scientist was rearranging tungsten carbide bricks around a plutonium core for a test called “tickling the dragon’s tail”. But he inadvertently dropped one of the bricks on the core, producing a blue flash of light, a mule kick of heat, and 25 days later his death from radiation sickness. The core was moved to a new site to keep it safer, but within a year another physicist was beating out time with a screwdriver between two beryllium spheres that surrounded the core so he could hear metronomic changes on a Geiger counter. “When he reached the approximate tempo of The Girl from Ipanema,” Hall reported, “the screwdriver slipped, the spheres came together – blue light, mule kick and nine days later he was dead.” That’s the next episode of Horrible Histories’ Stupid Deaths sorted.Russian scientists were not to be outdone in this race to climb Mount Stupid. One Soviet physicist put his head in a particle accelerator, which had an interesting consequence. Half his face didn’t age thereafter. Perhaps, suggested Hall, we should all do the same to attain eternal youth. No, really, after you, Mr Hall.Worse, the Soviets built plutonium facility No 817 in the Urals after the second world war and pumped its waste into a river. In 1957, waste tanks exploded, sending up radioactive clouds that spread over an area inhabited by 270,000 Russians, only 11,000 of whom were evacuated. Hundreds died. Hall noted the site of the Kyshtym disaster has been rebranded as the East Ural Nature Reserve. To be fair, that sounds nicer than Still A Carcinogenic Radioactive Wasteland.While Russian and American brainiacs were busy self-harming or narrowly avoiding slaying millions of their own citizens, other patriots fought proxy conflicts in basketball, chess and ice hockey. Even literature became a front in the cold war. The CIA funded a Russian edition of Pasternak’s banned Doctor Zhivago and leaned on the Nobel committee to give the author the literature prize. It was, Hall supposed, a brilliant secret weapon devised to bore as many Russians to death as possible. Only the fact that nobody finished the book explained why its body count was disappointing.Hall’s thesis was that the red menace was all sizzle and no steak. Rather, unprecedented US affluence produced anxiety – all those tail-finned Cadillacs and over-sized barbecues might disappear just as quickly as they had appeared. Such anxiety only needed a nudge from Senator Eugene McCarthy and allegorical sci-fi films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers, to escalate into full-blooded terror of the Other.As for the Russians, Hall supposed, “The idea of invading America didn’t enter their minds. They were too exhausted.” Purges, show trials, bread queues, five-year plans, gulags, religious persecution and pumping athletes with performance-enhancing drugs – all militated against reds being under American beds. They were most likely asleep in their own.Who won the cold war, Hall asked himself. Nobody, he replied. Instead, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former foes copied the worst of each other. America’s president is more Stalin than Kennedy in his lies, intimidation and smear tactics. Putin’s Russia has become ruthlessly capitalist. “It’s a gas station with rusty nukes out back,” said Hall. Which made me feel smug until I realised Britain is becoming like Russia – minus the gas station."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d4a9cd327e30c48b228050e30df4aee2ad2a3/488_245_2980_1789/master/2980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d7886508bd83a3a3080083e7a9c613","title":"david attenborough the making of a british icon","story":"Patrick Barkham joins Anushka Asthana to chart the rise of one of Britain’s best-loved personalities: the natural history broadcaster David Attenborough.

On Sunday, he put himself into what he imagined would be the mindset of Kushila Stein, a 45-year-old New Zealand woman lost at sea for close to three days.“I had an image of her being hungry and thirsty,” he said. “I tried to get into her head and think of what she would do. I imagined her beginning to despair and I thought of her doing whatever she could to survive.”In 119, the rescue boat the Greek coastguard officer has captained for the past decade, he also knew every moment would count. Stein had been adrift for longer than anyone he knew. Although an accomplished seafarer, the Warkworth native had not been seen since 1 November when, driven by the desire to “stretch her legs”, she had left the yacht she was helping to sail from Turkey to Athens and rowed in a dinghy to the nearby island of Folegandros.A text message from the Aegean isle was the last anyone had heard of her. Sent to Mike, the Englishman she was travelling with, it stated she was on her way back to the yacht. But that was before she had lost control of the inflatable dinghy after an oar had fallen overboard and then been driven off course by strong winds.Marietakis, 46, knew she might be preparing for the worse. “We were brought in after seven vessels, a combat helicopter and military plane had failed to find her,” he told the  from his base in Heraklion, the Cretan capital, on Tuesday. “All my thoughts were trained on finding this one human being. I knew that if we didn’t, she would probably not survive.”In 19 years of heading search and rescue operations, the coastguard officer says he has learned to train himself to “focus solely on the senses where nothing else exists and you can almost see better and hear better”.“We were looking for this little speck of a grey dinghy that in the ocean was so indistinguishable and so hard to see,” he said. “A plane and a helicopter had flown over the same area. She had spotted both and each time tried to catch their attention and they had missed her.”It took Marietakis and his two-man crew more than four hours to reach the waters between Folegandros and Crete, 60 nautical miles north-west of Heraklion, where the dinghy was eventually found.Stein, wearing a waterproof jacket, gym trousers and trainers, waved frantically. “She was clearly exhausted but very level-headed, very composed,” he said. “She had gone without fresh water and I think had begun to despair. She had survived on boiled sweets, which she had kept in a tiny pouch. By the time we found her, she said she had one left.”The hardy New Zealander was wet, cold and dehydrated when the Greek rescuers lifted her to safety. Plainly fearing the worst, she had taken the precautionary measure of writing her mother’s name and contact details on the side of the dinghy.But, as an experienced sailor, she had also done everything she possibly could to survive – wrapping herself in the few plastic bags she had with her, rationing the boiled sweets, her only source of sustenance, and regularly drying out her socks – her mother, Wendy, told media outlets in New Zealand.When search aircraft flew overhead, she tried to catch their attention by waving the one oar she still had.“She had drifted a very long way, over 40 nautical miles south of Folegandros,” said Marietakis, adding that the crew gave her water, coffee and croissant as soon as she was on board. “She was so happy. She hugged and kissed us but, if truth be told, I don’t know who was more overjoyed, us or her. We had saved a human being and she had survived to tell the tale.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad8ec55df7b51719982ed8e7f035bb5d6ff12fa/259_280_2804_1682/master/2804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840c16d4816c16e966566915d1263d03","title":"teenagers sentenced for of irish 14 year old ana kriegel","story":"Boys, now 15, are youngest people in Irish history to be convicted of murder Two teenage boys have been sentenced to life and 15 years respectively for murdering a schoolgirl who was lured to an abandoned house, savagely beaten and sexually assaulted in a case that has horrified Ireland.A judge in the central criminal court in Dublin on Tuesday sentenced one boy to life in detention, with the sentence to be reviewed after 12 years. The other received 15 years, with the sentence to be reviewed after eight years.They were 13 when they killed Ana Kriégel, 14, in a derelict house in the Dublin suburb of Lucan in May 2018. Because of their age they were not named and were referred to as Boy A and Boy B.Now 15, they became the youngest people in Irish history to be convicted of murder when the jury returned unanimous verdicts in June after a harrowing seven-week trial that evoked comparisons to the 1993 James Bulger atrocity.Mr Justice Paul McDermott deferred sentencing until this week to take into account probation and psychological reports.He said the killers could gain freedom while they were still relatively young men. “When that will be is not yet determined but much is based on your behaviour and attitude during your detention.”Addressing both boys, he said: “You will have to carry the guilt and shame of your involvement for the rest of your lives … at least you will have the opportunity to reconstruct yours in a positive way. Will you take it? You have the opportunity for a future and second chance, something you so wrongfully and cruelly denied to Ana.”He said Ana’s life was of “supreme importance” and that she had lived it “with energy, fun, imagination, love, dancing and music”.Prosecutors said Boy B called at Ana’s house and led her to a nearby derelict house where Boy A, whom she had a crush on, was waiting. He had assembled a “murder kit”: zombie mask, black gloves, shin guards, knee pads. His weapons were a long stick and a concrete block.Boy A received an eight-year sentence for sexual assault, to run concurrently with the murder sentence.During the trial, Boy A denied murder but the court heard he now appears to have accepted he killed Ana. He still denies sexual assault. Boy B admitted watching his friend attack Ana but still maintains his innocence in the murder.The boys will remain in Oberstown, Ireland’s only child detention campus, until they turn 18, when they will be moved to an adult prison to serve the balance of their sentence.The judge said there was little guidance relating to sentencing children for murder because “thankfully” there were so few cases. He had the power to impose a life term but that was not mandatory in the case of minors.In a victim impact statement, Ana’s mother, Geraldine, eulogised her daughter, who was adopted from Russia as a toddler, and spoke of the anguish of losing her.“She was wild and wonderful, electric, so full of fun, madness and laughter … she was the love of our lives.”She said there was no way to describe the pain and nightmares that followed the murder. “We brought Ana to live in a ‘safe’ place, a quiet country village, a leafy suburb, where the only sounds in the morning are doves cooing. No one could suspect the evil that lay in waiting for her. No one could anticipate the darkness that swirled in the souls of those that murdered and violated her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf2f040f4980bda5261bd52a93df4e86023b4a/0_0_4526_2715/master/4526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1f0323d696f7dd2266f5275f9ae5b1","title":"vladimir putin calls for reliable russian version of wikipedia","story":"President says user-edited site should be replaced with Big Russian EncyclopaediaVladimir Putin has called for the creation of a more “reliable” Russian version of Wikipedia.The president told a Kremlin meeting on the future of the Russian language: “As for Wikipedia … it’s better to replace it with the new Big Russian Encyclopaedia in electronic form,” RIA Novosti news agency reported. “At least that will be reliable information, presented in a good, modern way.”Putin was referring to a Russian encyclopaedia published between 2007 and 2014 in paper form.The government plans to allocate nearly 1.7bn rubles (£20.7m) to developing a Russian online reference resource similar to Wikipedia in the next three years, according to government documents published in September.Putin was responding to a comment by a university rector who complained about the use of Wikipedia by courts to reach verdicts.The widely used Russian-language Wikipedia, known as Vikipedia, says it has more than 1.5m articles.In 2015, Russia briefly banned Wikipedia over an entry on a form of cannabis.

Photograph: Alan BetsonA group of schoolchildren in burgundy jumpers, grey trousers and kilts milled around the ground floor of the Central Criminal Court on Tuesday morning, chatting, laughing, schoolbags swinging from their shoulders.Two floors up and a universe apart, two children of roughly the same age sat quietly with their families behind the closed doors of Court 9.Boy A and Boy B, as they have been known throughout the trial, were there to hear the sentence that would be handed down to them for the murder of another child, Ana Kriégel.Two children, waiting to be sentenced for the murder of another child. There is little by way of legal precedent, and no preparation for us a society, for something like this. Only twice before in modern times have children in Ireland been found guilty of murder, Mr Justice Paul McDermott said, as he delivered sentencing on Tuesday. Boy A and Boy B are the youngest people in the history of the State to be convicted of murder.The enormity of the task before him, and the extent of the devastation suffered by the families in his court – Ana Kriégel’s most of all – was reflected at times in the judge’s demeanour and the length of the judgment, which continued for one hour and 45 minutes. At one point towards the end, he paused, took off his glasses and rubbed his face. When he spoke again, his voice was lower.Ana’s voiceThere was a sense throughout much of the trial for her murder that Ana’s own voice had not been heard. That changed last week, when she was brought vividly into the heart of proceedings in her mother Geraldine’s victim impact statement. And the judge again put her at the centre of his remarks in court on Tuesday. “Anastasia Kriégel’s life is and was of supreme importance,” he said at the outset.She was “a lovely and loving child within a loving family”.Turning to her parents, he said: “There is no solace for them in this process. Ana’s murder has resulted in a sentence which is lifelong. The death of a child and the manner in which it occurred has caused them deep misery and the destruction of their lives.”Even the longest sentence would end at some point, whereas the suffering of the deceased victim’s family would be permanent, he said.Geraldine and Patric Kriégel, accompanied by five supporters, sat to one side during the sentencing. They were calm and perhaps more at ease than they had been during the trial, as Geraldine made notes throughout the proceedings in an A4 notebook.Boy A was accompanied to court by his parents and both grandfathers. Boy B’s father, who had been absent from the sentencing hearing on October 29th, was back in court, along with the boy’s mother and two other family members.The reaction to the sentences, when they finally came, was muted. Boy A was given a life sentence, with a review after 12 years, for murder, and a concurrent sentence of 12 years for aggravated sexual assault. His mother began to weep quietly. He clutched her arm.For Boy B, the sentence was 15 years, with a review after eight. Boy B’s father rubbed his son’s shoulder as it was delivered. The boys rarely looked up, and never at one another.Ordinary boysThese are boys who, the evidence in the trial had suggested and Mr Justice McDermott noted again on Tuesday, were remarkable before May 14th, 2018, for their apparent ordinariness.Boy A, his grandfather previously said, was a loved and loving boy, with a passion for drawing and model-making. Boy B, the court heard during the trial, still liked Transformers and playing with Pokémon cards, and he had a striking intelligence. Both boys came from stable, law-abiding, loving and socially engaged homes, the judge said.It was a murder that happened in “a normal, well-established urban community, on a normal sunny May afternoon on a normal working day”, carried out by two boys who, the court heard, showed no evidence of depression, mental illness or psychotic disorder no evidence of risk-taking behaviour or poor impulse control no factors in their social or family backgrounds no difficulties with authority.There was, it seemed, no explanation, no sense to be made of it at all.Addressing the boys directly at the very end of the hearing, the judge said: “You will both have to carry the guilt and shame of your involvement in, and responsibility for, her death for the rest of your lives.”“You will have the opportunity for a future, a second chance – something of which you so wrongfully and cruelly deprived Ana Kriégel.”Standing outside the court afterwards, Ana Kriégel’s parents gave a short, dignified statement that was steeped in pain. Her father said: “Forever is not long enough. Please remember Ana and keep her in your hearts, somewhere.”Expressing “extreme gratitude”, Geraldine Kriégel paid tribute to Det Insp Mark O’Neill, who had led the murder investigation, and to liaison officer Sgt Siobhán McIntyre “for holding the family up through all this pain”.And she thanked the media for its understanding during the tragedy, “our family, our friends and our neighbours, and thank you to all the wonderful people out there who supported us and kept us going”.After they left and a brief Garda press conference had ended, the family of Boy B came quietly out the same door, unnoticed by passersby and the few remaining members of the media. They hurried away in the opposite direction, their own grief and disbelief etched across their faces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4073202.1572984496!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"forever is not long enough kriegel family speak after sentencing","story":"Patric and Geraldine Kriégel made an brief statement outside the Central Criminal Court after the sentencing of two boys for the murder of their daughter Ana.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Geraldine and Patric Kriégel at the Criminal Courts of Justice after the sentencing hearing.

Mrs Kriégel also said her family wished to thank the media, for being so understanding the victim support unit “our family, our friends and our neighbours, and thank you to all the wonderful people out there who supported us and kept us going”. Mr Kriégel said “justice has been served for Ana” following the sentencing.“The judge has decided on the sentence and that duty lies with him alone. For our part, we can only say that forever is not long enough. Please remember Ana and keep her in your hearts, somewhere,” he said before the couple left holding hands. followed by family and friends.Supt John Gordon, flanked by Det Insp O’Neill and Chief Supt Lorraine Wheatley, said their thoughts were with the Kriégel family.“We would like to extend our sincere sympathies to the family and the extended family who have borne this trial with great dignity,” he said. The murder inquiry was a difficult and complex one and, he said, and he wanted to acknowledge the support and help received from the community. “Without their help we wouldn’t be in the place we are today.”Supt Gordon acknowledged the work of the gardaí involved in the case, under the leadership of Det Insp O’Neill and Chief Supt Wheatley, who he said had dealt with the case with a high degree of sensitivity. “Each and every one of them stepped up to the mark.”Supt Gordon said it was a difficult case for all concerned “and raises many questions for many people about the care of young people in our society today and we would like to bear in mind at this time that the role of protection of our young people is not just a matter for An Garda Síochana but is for each and every one of us”.

The exact level of the coffee cup levy is yet to be finalised, and will depend on “market research”, but it is expected to be either 10 cent, 15 cent or 25 cent It will apply to all single-use cups, including compostable cups. The environmental levies will be introduced in phases. As well as the levy on coffee cups and the increase in the plastic bag levy, the first phase will also see medium weight plastic bags – often sold as heavy duty bags – hit with the plastic bag levy for the first time. Other charges in the first phase, set to be completed by the end of 2021, include a €5 per tonne waste recovery levy that would apply to landfill, waste and export and an increase in the landfill levy from €75 per tonne to €80 per tonne. The second phase, completed by the end of 2023, will include levies on take-away containers. A third phase will see charges on retail food packaging, such as plastic used for baked goods, fruit and vegetables. Coffee shops will also be asked to display a range of prices: the cost of a coffee in a reusable cup the cost if a single-use cup is used and the cost of having a coffee on the premises using the coffee shop’s own cups.All money raised from such levies will be invested in environmental initiatives, such as programmes to tackle litter and waste.Mr Bruton said “a coffee cup levy has clear benefits for the environment”, noting that 22,000 disposable cups are used every hour."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4073346.1572971767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"owners of defective apartments aim to hold government to account","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tApartment owner Andrew Prior and Kath Cottier, head of new lobbying group the Construction Defects Alliance, outside Leinster House. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Apartment owners from more than a dozen different complexes across Dublin who face repair bills due to construction defects have come together to form a lobbying group looking for State redress.The Construction Defects Alliance will address the joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing on Thursday, when it will tell members of its aim to have the Safe as Houses report implemented.In 2016, an Oireachtas housing committee report, Safe as Houses, recommended the establishment of a redress scheme to assist homeowners whose defective houses were built prior to the 2014 building regulations. It suggested a number of funding mechanisms, including an industry levy and a tax rebate scheme.The Construction Defects Alliance is led by Kath Cottier, director of housing services with Clúid Housing, who is also chair of the Beacon South Quarter owners’ management company.The alliance also has the support of the Apartment Owners’ Network as well as people involved in more than a dozen developments near Swords, Blanchardstown, south Meath, Dublin city centre, Dublin 6, Dublin 12, Stillorgan and Sandyford.Speaking to The , Ms Cottier said the purpose of the group is to “hold the Government to account”.“I really think there has been an injustice for people, and I see how it really does affect people’s lives. It’s about money, but it’s also about stress, and about being comfortable where you live and your home as well.”Ms Cottier says a number of political parties have shown interest in the construction defects issue, but she would now like to see proposals on manifestos in the lead-up to the next general election.“Many political parties are very interested, they genuinely do understand the concerns and the issues that we’re presenting. We would like recognition of that in people’s manifestos so that there is an opportunity when it comes to forming a government and deciding on the programme for government, it is given a high priority.”Andrew Prior, a homeowner in Beacon South Quarter, is originally from Bradford in the UK, where a fire engulfed the soccer stadium and killed 56 people in May 1985.‘Not our fault’“This is not our fault. The reality of it is that we bought this apartment for €375,000, the Government got €44,500 in VAT on that when we bought it, which is a considerable amount of money.“The builder won’t engage and the solicitor tells us it’ll be €750,000 as a minimum to take a case, with a 20 per cent chance of success – but I did nothing wrong. I have done nothing wrong here,” Mr Prior said.Sinn Féin spokesman on housing Eoin Ó Broin welcomed the group’s formation.“To date groups of owners who have discovered latent defects in their homes have been left to their own devices, and it was a very long and frustrating process trying to work out what needed to be done.“The fact that a very significant group of homeowners have come together is very positive and hopefully that group can now put pressure on the State to do something about it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4073681.1572991209!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord original citizens assembly gay byrne takes precedence","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin described Gay Byrne aptly as  “perhaps, our original Citizens’ Assembly”. Photograph: Nick BradshawTDs were in no doubt about their first item of business this week. It involved a change to the usual running order. There was no argument about it.An almighty procedural row blew up a little later, but that was on a different matter.On the occasion of the death of Gay Byrne, the Dáil was unanimous in its wish to pay tribute to Ireland’s all-time favourite broadcaster before giving consideration to anything else.Sometimes our parliamentarians are slow to catch on to the public mood, often far too many cautious steps behind what the public has been thinking for a long time.Beginning with business as usual on Tuesday was not an option.A book of condolences was placed in the main lobby of Leinster House, a rare occurrence. It last happened in June 2016 after the murder of the British Labour MP Jo Cox.The Ceann Comhairle led the way. Seán Ó Fearghaíl deemed it “appropriate” that Dáil time be given to join the “national outpouring of respect and recognition – respect for the colossus that Gay Byrne was on the world stage of public service broadcasting and recognition for the role he played as a catalyst in the evolution of Irish society over the past 50 years”.Sentiments and memoriesHe was followed by a succession of party and group leaders echoing familiar sentiments and memories expressed by so many since Monday’s sad announcement. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar expressed condolences on behalf of the Government.Of all the leaders who spoke so warmly of the man universally known as “Uncle Gaybo”, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin put it best, astutely observing “he was, perhaps, our original Citizens’ Assembly”.The truce in honour of Gay then gave way to the knockabout hostilities which so exasperated the broadcaster when he was behind the microphone.Hospital overcrowding would have been another bugbear. And it’s still a burning issue in today’s Dáil.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald asked the Taoiseach to “imagine” what it would be like if he was sick and had to go to hospital today. Imagine how worried he would be and how worried his family would be with the thoughts of him having to go into a hospital creaking under the strain and pressure.“Upsetting and terrified” is how Mary Lou imagined it would be for him.He didn’t need to imagine any of her scenarios. “I am a doctor by profession” he declared, outlining his years (seven) working in the public health service. Not to mention his time as a minister for health. Which he did, even though it isn’t a topic he should be boasting about.‘Trust me, I’m a doctor’Nonetheless, Dr Varadkar doesn’t have to be told by the likes of Mary Lou or anybody else about conditions in emergency departments for staff, patients and their families. He’s known about it for years and years, man and boy.“We are making every effort to improve the situation,” said Leo “Trust me, I’m a doctor” Varadkar.He isn’t the first doctor to become minister for health. Remember James Reilly? Others too in recent times such as Rory O’Hanlon and John O’Connell – and three times health minister Michael Woods (although he was a doctor of horticulture, specialising in tomatoes).We ran our eye along Tuesday’s Cabinet turnout to see if the jobs match the portfolios, the way Leo’s does, ignoring the fact that he was no great shakes in health.Next to him, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Transatlantic yachtsman. Fair enough.Then Josepha Madigan, Minister for the Arts and a solicitor. A profession which, given some of the court reports of insurance claims, could certainly claim an affinity with the creative arts.Eoghan Murphy, Minister for Housing. He worked with a variety of NGOs in “international arms control” and in the area of nuclear disarmament. Which is slightly worrying in this massive housing crisis.Richard Bruton, economist and Minister for Communications. Because economists are great at communicating.Joe McHugh, Minister for Education, a teacher. Charlie Flanagan, Minister for Justice, a solicitor. Is this the Taoiseach’s simple method for selecting Ministers?Good in theory, not so good in practice.‘Money message’The method of selecting motions for debate is far from simple. It caused absolute ructions in the chamber during the Order of Business, which happens straight after Leaders’ Questions.Richard Boyd Barrett of Solidarity-People Before Profit was fuming. His group’s motion to change standing orders, another name for the rules of the House, was down for discussion on Wednesday evening but thrown off the schedule at the last minute by the Ceann Comhairle’s office.This is an interesting one. It concerns a thing called a “money message”. It was put into the Constitution by Éamon de Valera to ensure that the Opposition can’t wrest control of the national coffers from the Government. If the Opposition devises legislation which makes a call on State funds, it cannot proceed unless a money message signed by the Taoiseach is forthcoming.In a piece in The  in June, former clerk of the Dáil Kieran Coughlan wrote that the Fine Gael government’s use of this money message to block opposition Bills was “unprecedented” in the last 50 years of the Dáil.So while the Government crows about the openness of new politics and how so many opposition private members’ Bills are being accepted and discussed and voted upon, most of them crash on the rocks of this little-known rule.If Boyd Barrett was incandescent, his colleague Bríd Smyth was a conflagration. How dare the Ceann Comhairle stop them introducing their Bill to prevent the Government abusing the money message?Sabotage was mentioned several times. It was “at the very least, shoddy” and at the very worst “totally undemocratic” railed Smyth.The Ceann Comhairle wasn’t entirely unsympathetic but he said he was acting on the advice of the Clerk of the Dáil and the parliamentary office.He had to suspend proceedings, declaring he wouldn’t be bullied, as Boyd Barrett and colleagues roared in protest.“Seriously. What is the point of this charade?” he asked, disgusted. “This place has brought itself to a new low.”Through all the upheaval, the Taoiseach calmly studied his phone or made notes on his folder. Not in the least bit moved.His Government is playing fast and lose with this rule because it can. It’s lousy and everyone knows it.It’s probably too complicated to bother the voters, though. And that’s all that matters.Tributes and assessments by those who knew him best"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons november 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Only children are more likely to be obese because their parents spoil them with unhealthy food and drinks, study findsDemocrats claim victory over Trump-backed governor in KentuckyGrace Millane murder trial: Court hears how British backpacker died in New ZealandScientists from around the world declare climate emergencyFunding pledge to avoid general election polling stations ruining school nativities, government announcesLabour risks \u0026#39Ed Stone\u0026#39 moment as it issues its 10 policy commandments for 2020Shopping trolley warning as Asda admits 100k of their scan and go devices are unsafe for childrenDonald Trump offers to send the US army to Mexico in response to Mormon murdersOpen Championship and Ashes should become \u0026#39protected\u0026#39 TV events to \u0026#39unite the country\u0026#39, say LordsAll children to receive whole genome sequencing at birth, under ambitions laid out by Matt Hancock  \u0026#39Was my daughter a victim?\u0026#39 Mother\u0026#39s anguish after teenage nursery worker accused of sex attacks on childrenComment: This is a Brexit election.

avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament through the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs).Created with Sketch.These products may become more costly in the trade war Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Orange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsOrange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsSuch changes have the potential to “vastly increase devolution of food safety regulation”, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland - which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

plans to prepare for Brexit, and just under three in 10 have put plans in place specifically for a no-deal scenario. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) have specific plans which prepare them for a Brexit extension.Rosie Bailey of CitySprint, said: “SMEs sit right at the heart of our economy. While it’s great to see that they feel upbeat and resilient, thanks to many years spent flexing their business to suit the times, it’s clear that they also need some extra support to help navigate the specific complexities of Brexit.“With time running out, business owners should take immediate steps to seek out the information they need to understand the potential impact of Brexit in whatever form it takes and put clear plans in place to help their organisation mitigate these.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Actual output has come in above the level that polls have suggested.Nonetheless, the figures demonstrate the level of confidence among British businesses and\u0026nbspshow Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has received only a “lukewarm” reception from British firms, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Services account for four-fifths of UK output and had, until recently, remained relatively\u0026nbspresilient in while construction and manufacturing contracted sharply.Brexiteers have got it so wrong on the slumping poundAmong the worst-hit sectors has been the car industry which has seen investment collapse since the 2016 EU referendum. New data released on Tuesday showed a further 6.7 per cent slump in the number of vehicles rolling off production lines in October.Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.The decline was driven by a 13.2 per cent drop in demand from private consumers. Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament through the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs).Created with Sketch.These products may become more costly in the trade war Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Orange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsOrange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsSuch changes have the potential to “vastly increase devolution of food safety regulation”, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland - which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe report also suggests EU safeguards on food standards will be weakened as soon as the UK leaves, with the Government planning to scrap the requirement for independent scientific assessments on the safety of pesticides and allowing minister to lower thresholds for labelling when genetically-modified crops are used.Professor Erik Millstone, emeritus professor in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, said: “Our analysis suggests Brexit SIs will allow ministers to exercise considerable powers of discretion when authorising ingredients in pesticide products, amending GMO authorisations and thresholds for labelling, authorising food additives and approving substances for animal carcass washes.“Ministers may issue guidance impacting substantive policy content or make new rules governing food safety by secondary legislation, without proper parliamentary scrutiny and using powers that exceed those vested by the EU in the European Commission.“Those considerable powers could be a way to overcoming parliamentary resistance and public opposition to aspects of a UK-US trade deal.”Recommending that devolved nations have “strong oversight over UK external trade negotiations”, the study also calls for primary legislation to be required where there could be major policy changes on food safety.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

suggests.Only a third of 1,000 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) surveyed by distribution company CitySprint said they had seen the government’s “Get Ready For Brexit” advertising campaign.One in five said they had not seen or accessed any government guidance or support since 2016, raising questions about how well prepared smaller businesses are, according to the report.Almost half of those polled said they do not believe the government has done enough to help businesses prepare for Brexit.Despite the findings, half of SMEs said they felt more confident than they did 12 months ago, and

plans to prepare for Brexit, and just under three in 10 have put plans in place specifically for a no-deal scenario. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) have specific plans which prepare them for a Brexit extension.Rosie Bailey of CitySprint, said: “SMEs sit right at the heart of our economy. While it’s great to see that they feel upbeat and resilient, thanks to many years spent flexing their business to suit the times, it’s clear that they also need some extra support to help navigate the specific complexities of Brexit.“With time running out, business owners should take immediate steps to seek out the information they need to understand the potential impact of Brexit in whatever form it takes and put clear plans in place to help their organisation mitigate these.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Actual output has come in above the level that polls have suggested.Nonetheless, the figures demonstrate the level of confidence among British businesses and\u0026nbspshow Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has received only a “lukewarm” reception from British firms, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Services account for four-fifths of UK output and had, until recently, remained relatively\u0026nbspresilient in while construction and manufacturing contracted sharply.Brexiteers have got it so wrong on the slumping poundAmong the worst-hit sectors has been the car industry which has seen investment collapse since the 2016 EU referendum. New data released on Tuesday showed a further 6.7 per cent slump in the number of vehicles rolling off production lines in October.Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.The decline was driven by a 13.2 per cent drop in demand from private consumers. Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and ScotlandUniversity staff will pay around £40,000 more into their pension – but they will receive nearly £200,000 less in retirement following reforms to the pension scheme, the UCU says.Increased contributions and other changes to the universities superannuation scheme (USS) mean that many people are suffering substantial losses, the union has previously warned.Jo Grady, general secretary of the UCU, said: The first wave of strikes will hit universities later this month unless the employers start talking to us seriously about how they are going to deal with rising pension costs and declining pay and conditions.Students face disruption as university staff back strike actionShe added: Universities can be in no doubt about the strength of feeling on these issues and we will be consulting branches whose desire to strike was frustrated by anti-union laws about reballoting.Last week, UCU members backed strike action in two separate disputes, one on pensions and one on pay and working conditions.Overall, 79 per cent of UCU members who voted backed strike action in the ballot over changes to pensions.In the ballot on pay, equality, casualisation and workloads, 74 per cent of members backed strike action.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA number of elite universities - including Cambridge, Durham and Bristol - are among the institutions being hit by strikes.As well as the eight strike days, union members will begin other forms of industrial action when they return to work.This will include working strictly to contract, not covering for absent colleagues, and refusing to reschedule lectures lost to strike action.A Universities UK spokesperson said: We are hopeful that the dispute can be resolved without industrial action, but plans are in place to ensure that any potential disruption to students and staff is minimised.They added that the pensions changes were both fair and reasonable and said\u0026nbspthe scheme was one of the best in the country.\u0026nbspWe hope that UCU will now join us to consider governance reforms and alternative options for future valuations, which deliver a shared set of principles, increased transparency and a sustainable scheme, they said.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspUniversities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents employers in the pay disputes, said the strike action will be damaging to students.A spokesperson said: “Having achieved strike votes in only 57 of the 147 Higher Education institutions where it balloted, we are dismayed to see UCU’s decision to ask its members to take such extensive and damaging strike action over its national pay demands.\u0026nbspThis is after UCU has failed to secure its members\u0027 support in the large majority (90) of institutions where it also balloted following a big campaign over nearly two months.It is completely unrealistic in the collective pay arrangements for UCU to attempt to force all 147 employers to re-open the concluded 2019-20 national pay round.The outcome was already at the very limit of what is affordable and the ballots confirm that the vast majority of employees in these institutions understand the challenging context.University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Researchers will study how weightlessness and space radiation affect the ageing process. The goal is to develop new flavours and properties for the food industry.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bottles flew up aboard a Northrop Grumman capsule that launched from Virginia on Saturday and arrived at the International Space Station on Monday. Each bottle was packed in a metal canister to prevent breakage.Universities in Bordeaux, France, and Bavaria, Germany, are taking part in the experiment from Space Cargo Unlimited, a Luxembourg startup.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberWinemaking uses both yeast and bacteria, and involves chemical processes, making wine ideal for space study, said University of Erlangen-Nuremberg\u0027s Michael Lebert, the experiment\u0027s scientific director, in a company video.The space-aged wine will be compared to Bordeaux wine aged on Earth.

Also on board: an oven for baking chocolate chip cookies, as well as samples of carbon fibre used by Italy\u0027s Lamborghini in its sports cars.Budweiser has already sent barley seeds to the station, with an eye to becoming the beverage of choice on Mars. In 2015, a Japanese company known for its whiskey and other alcoholic drinks sent up samples. Scotch also made a visit to space in another experiment.As for high-flying wine cellars, this isn\u0027t the first. A French astronaut took along a bottle of wine aboard shuttle Discovery in 1985. The bottle remained corked in orbit.The space station\u0027s current crew includes three Americans, two Russians and an Italian.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.130 Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, ParisIt\u0027s the mysteriously serene smile of this painting\u0027s subject – thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant – that has given it universal fame. The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body.

Nobody can be sure how this Battle for Britain will pan out, any more than in .Tory election manager Isaac Levido told staff this week: “There is a steep and narrow path to victory.”Another aide says: “It is unknowable. This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma. But the blighter Bercow has gone at last.Long live the new Speaker, whoever he or she may be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Evenwe can argue about the “weather” bit.Two contestants, though, go straight into the all-time Apprentice Hall Of Fame, alongside the greats like Paul Torrisi and Stuart Baggs.First is Cockney barrow boy Thomas Skinner, who sticks out among the boys like Ray Winstone in a touring production of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, and has turned out to be a lot more likeable than I was expecting.The second, though, most certainly hasn’t. For she is Lottie Lion, the librarian and wine snob who’s given to quoting Shakespeare: “For though she is but little she is a massive pain in the a**e.” Or words to that effect.All your worst office nightmares rolled into one, this girl. An undermining, ­passive-aggressive crawler who can swivel on a sixpence, depending on which way Lord Sugar’s wind is blowing.“In business there is no room for ­gambling.” “Hang on. Business is a gamble. You don’t take risks, you get nowhere.” “Yes, risk-taking is important, Lord Sugar.”Lottie’s also not helped by the fact she’s often right and most certainly wasn’t to blame for the failure of the scavenger hunt task which disintegrated, in ­shameful fashion, right at the start when team Empower’s Pamela Laird asked: “Does anyone know when the Second World War started ” Silence. They didn’t know when it started, ­finished, or even what side was responsible for killing Biggie and Tupac.A media meltdown followed, yet, amid the general despair, no one bothered to thank The Apprentice for the public ­service of flagging up this ignorance, because that’s not what happens with this show. Instead, it gets accused of stuff.This year, inevitably, it’s been called racist and claims have been made that the first four candidates were sacked due to their skin colour, rather than the fact they were completely useless or ­produced a “bespoke ­corporate ­lollipop” that looked more like a vibrator.It’s only Twitter that’s saying these things, of course, but they need to be quashed as the BBC is actually dumb enough to listen to these imbeciles and forget Sugar’s first winner was Tim Campbell and his show is about the only place on the network where black and minority ethnic people will be treated entirely on their merits.Get rid of The Apprentice and, I guarantee you, its ­precious and entertaining hours will be filled with the same mollycoddling, box-ticking, ­condescending, right-on ­b*****ks that fills most of the rest of the Beeb’s output.Treasure this show while you still can .The One Show, Matt Baker: “I’m very much looking forward to talking about your play, Meera [Syal].”The X Factor: Celebrity, Louis Walsh to Jenny Ryan: “Very few people can sing Shirley Bassey but you nailed every single note.”With a Black  Decker staple gun and no anaesthetic.ONLY two places there’s ever likely to be a demand for Vinnie Jones to sing Lip Up Fatty, by Bad Manners.One of them is Piers Morgan’s Hollywood wake.Thankfully, that’s probably still a good  or  months away.So I’ll stick with the other, X Factor: Celebrity, where we were already several horrors into the night when Martin Bashir’s brain developed technical issues, just as he was about to assault the second verse of EasyLike Sunday Morning.“I’ve forgotten the words . . .“A wah wah-waaah wanna be freeeee.“I do apologise.”Not necessary, Martin.Vinnie’s manic can-can took the initial sting out of things a couple of turns later.And, when it came to the climax, Simon Cowell dodged his decision and the public voted-off Jonny Labey and Victoria Ekanoye instead of a startled Bashir, who gasped: “What has happened ”You stayed silent. They sang.

But in the meantime, it’s important to take whatever diabetes medication helps you to manage your blood sugar levels properly to prevent long term complications.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You wanted a child who looked more like you.But rubbishing the suggestion Mrs Mander replied: I do not look white and I do not look Hispanic. We were advised not to tick every box, we did not mind what ethnicity the child was, we were willing to offer any child a loving home. All the correspondence felt like it was the colour of my skin which was why we were rejected.”The court heard Adoption Berkshires gatekeeper Ms Loades single-handedly rejected the Manders adoption application. She told the court she deferred the application indefinitely because the couple wanted a young under-three years old, simple needs child.Ms Loades claimed the council had a lot of older vulnerable children who needed placing for adoption so she told Mr and Mrs Manders to come back another time.The court was told social worker Shirley Popat visited the couple’s five-bed home in Maidenhead to assess them. But in a  phone call she “confirmed she would not accept our application due to our cultural heritage and our only other option was to adopt from India or Pakistan, Mrs Mander said.Recalling a phone conversation between her husband and the social worker, Mrs Mander added: I could hear from his voice that something wasn’t right.I heard something about cultural heritage,” a smartly-dressed Mrs Mander told the court. I felt that I should have the same right to enter the process as anyone .”Katherine Foster, defending, told the couple: “You are now determined to attribute racism to these social workers. You interpreted it as being racist when it was not.”Ms Foster conceded Mr Mander, the Vice President of an IT company, had dismissed the issue of race in a meeting. She said: “On April  Shirley Popat visited your home and your husband emphasised that you both have pale skin and touched his arm to show that point.The Manders claim direct discrimination on the grounds of race, in breach of Section  of the Equality Act  and the European Convention on Human Rights.The pair say they should not have been rejected from even joining the approved adopters register because of where their parents were born.

Presenter Susanna Reid asked the Shadow Cabinet minister five times how Labour would campaign in a second referendum.Unable to give a straight answer, he blustered: “Well, in a sense, what I campaign for is secondary because what we are saying is that it is for the country to decide.  We’re saying less power to politicians, that’s where we have been struck for the last ½ years.”Ms Reid asked him againLabour wanted Britain to leave the EU or remain. An almost incoherent Sir Keir muttered: “The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you.”He also revealed that while he will be in charge of Labour’s bid to renegotiate Brexit, he has already ruled out voting for the deal in a second referendum. Instead he wants Britain to Remain. But challenged on this bizarre stance, the rattled frontbencher said: “That is missing the point.”Sir Keir went on to say the EU’s Customs Union would have to be “reconfigured” because it only allows Member States to set the negotiating mandates for free trade agreements .Labour wants to rip up the rules so the UK can negotiate FTAs “in conjunction” with the bloc. But EU diplomats warned there was “not much” the bloc could do to involve Britain in shaping its trade policy other than drawing up a “consultation” role.And in a major blow to Mr Corbyn’s election hopes, outgoing Brussels boss Jean-Claude Juncker last night panned Labour’s vision. Speaking about Mr Corbyn’s plan to negotiate a new deal with the EU and then put it to a second referendum, Mr Juncker told the BBC: “Honestly spoken, I don’t think that this is a realistic approach.”But the Labour boss defended the policy, insisting his party can negotiate a brand new agreement with the EU in less than three months.He said: “Keir and I have spent many, many hours in Brussels and other European capitals. We wouldn’t be saying thiswe didn’t think it was realistic and do-able.”But Mr Juncker wasn’t the only senior EU official to dismiss the idea. One senior source said Mr Corbyn’s strategy was “not credible” and “delusional”.Another admitted that rewriting the PM’s deal to include a closer relationship would be “easy” to achieve within three months, but added: “Less straightforward is what the UK may ask on EU trade policy.”KEIR STARMER: You get a referendum...you get the choice between the best deal that can be secured...or Remain.SR: And what are you going to campaign for in that second referendum KS: What I campaign for is secondary...SR: Hang on, hang on, I need to know what you believe in  Do you think we should leave or remain KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you.SR: But I am voting for you...Do you want to leave or remain KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. I’ve said many times what my personal position is.SR: You want to remain.KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. But that is missing the point.SR: So I am voting to stay in the EU...Are we leaving or remaining KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. We are going to, within six months, have a referendum and we are going to say here is the best deal that can be secured and it is going to go up against Remain and we are going to let the public decide.SR: It will be such a good deal that you yourself will vote against it KS: Well we are duty bound to get the best deal…SR: But how can it be a really good dealyou are going to vote against it After Sir Keir’s sloppy interview, he and Mr Corbyn travelled to the swing seat of Harlow, Essex, to insist Labour’s contorted Brexit position was in fact “very simple”.But Mr Corbyn refused to rule out reversing the EU referendum result altogetherthat helps him get the keys to No.He said: “All I can say is we are campaigning to win this election with a majority Labour government. We are not campaigning to form a coalition with anybody. We’re campaigning to go into office to carry out our manesto and that’s exactly what we’re going to be doing for the next five weeks in this election campaign.”Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson has already “ruled out” a deal to put Mr Corbyn in Downing Street. But former Labour MP Chuka Umunna — now a Lib Dem — hinted a back-room arrangement may be possibleLabour ditches its leader.He added: “The two main parties in their current configuration are not fit for purpose.”“The Labour Party can’t deliver that change and are a vote for the opposite — more delay and uncertainty. They won’t rule out revoking Article  altogether and want unlimited immigration, which would put pressure on our NHS.”In another stump speech, Mr Corbyn will insist the December  election is not about him, as he sets out his stall to be PM.

Yet the way Ahmed’s case has been pumped up as a great cause celebre for women is frankly ridiculous.The real scandal is not that a highly paid female BBC presenter has been paid less than a male one. It is that the BBC is lavishing such fat pay on any of them while pleading poverty and ending free TV licences for people over .Ahmed’s case for equal pay is very weak. It is based on the argument that presenting Newswatch — which holds BBC’s news programmes to account — is of equal value to presenting Vine’s old show, Points Of View, which invited comments from the public on a wide iety of BBC programmes.The BBC claims the disparity is down to the fact that Points Of View is classied as entertainment while Newswatch comes under news.  Surely a more direct comparison would be between what Ahmed is paid and what her male predecessor, Raymond Snoddy, was paid.She received the same as he did. How is that gender discrimination   But while the BBC might have a strong defence in Ahmed’s case, it doesn’t endear the corporation to me.Every time the BBC Charter comes up for renewal, it poses as a terribly worthy public ­service broadcaster putting out serious, educational programmes no commercial broadcaster would touch.Unless the Government allows it to jack up the licence fee, it argues, it will mean no more David Attenborough, no more news correspondents in Mogadishu.Then, as soon as the BBC Charter is renewed, it goes back to pumping out the same old entertainment shows, many of them indistinguishable from commercial TV.A genuine public service broadcaster would not pay Gary Lineker £.million a year, Graham Norton £,or Huw Edwards £,.Compared with the fattest of BBC fat cats, Samira Ahmed might well feel undervalued. Yet earning £ for presenting a -minute programme would be a dream for many TV licence-payers, many of whom do not even earn that amount of money in a week.The BBC is merciless in its efforts to collect what is really a tax on TV ownership. Unlike other unpaid utility bills, failing to buy a TV licence is a criminal offence, leading to low-paid people struggling with finances being dragged through the courts.Last year, , people were prosecuted for non-payment. By the way,  per cent of them were women — possibly because they were more likely to be at home during the day when TV licence enforcement officers tend to call. That is the real gender unfairness, not highly paid female BBC presenters receiving less money than male presenters.Ahmed’s case has highlighted the old boys’ world from which the BBC hires its presenters.  Vine, she claims, was “gted” his Radio  show without any proper recruitment process. BBC management then allowed his agent to jack up his salary.The BBC seems to see itself as immune from the pay restraint where in the public sector. When David Cameron became Prime Minister, he said any public body would need an extremely good excuse to pay anyone more than the £, a year he then earned.Yet the BBC’s accounts for   show it paid  “on-air talent” salaries in excess of this figure.  While there have been token reductions for some male ­presenters, such as the now- retired John Humphrys, many have seen salary increases.High pay doesn’t end with the presenters. There were also  BBC managers and executives who were paid more than the PM last year.  If the BBC wants to justy the TV licence, it needs to be cutting excessive pay among its board and ­presenters.If it wants to be a commercial station, on the other hand, it should give up the licence fee and find funding from subscriptions and ­advertising.  Then it wouldn’t be our business how much its executives and presenters were paid because their salaries would come out of the pockets only of people who chose to subscribe to its programmes.This is particularly important now, in the week that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have vowed to sort out the threat of over-s losing their licence fee exemption.As it becomes an urgent election issue, the worst look for the BBC is to be seen throwing money at presenters rather than the people it needs most — its loyal viewers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would put us at greater risk.“The Americans would be very wary indeed about having the same broad confidence in intelligence sharing.”The concerns stem from Corbyns perceived support for anti-West states and his opposition to Trident.Back in April, Corbyn was branded a danger to Britain after signalling he would scrap Trident in a car-crash interview with Andrew Marr.Corbyn went against his party’s official position by saying he was not sure a promise to renew Trident nukes would be in Labour’s election manesto.Several former defence chiefs, Labour cabinet ministers and high-ranking diplomats have since expressed their concerns over Labour moving to  Downing Street.The former defence secretary Lord Hutton of Furness confirmed that a Corbyn premiership would “place a major question mark over the continued operation of a vital source of intelligence.”He said: “It’s impossible to look at it with anything other than extreme alarm.His views on Nato, his anti-Americanism, his failure to support any single British military expedition since he came into parliament, his opposition to nuclear weapons and his support for Putin’s Russia — his world view is completely at odds with every postwar Labour leader.”Whitehall sources have also claimed that Labour leader’s director of strategy Seamus Milne could be banned from seeing the most sensitive intelligenceCorbyn wins the election.It comes as Corbyn suffered a major blow as Brussels blasted his “delusional” plan to renegotiate Boris Johnson’s deal and secure a say over EU trade talks.EU officials and diplomats told The Sun that Labour’s bid to rip up the rules of the Customs Union so the UK can negotiate FTAs “in conjunction” with the bloc would meet fierce opposition.But one EU source warned: “Less straightforward is what the UK may ask on EU trade policy. The first thing would be a UK request for an extension, with a justication for that.”Another added that Corbyn’s strategy was “not credible” and “as delusional” as Boris Johnson’s pledge to negotiate a trade deal before the end of December ."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Rees-Mogg “profoundly” apologised for suggesting Grenfell victims should have used common sense and ignored fire service guidance not to leave the burning tower block. Mr Rees-Mogg’s apology came after an LBC appearance on Monday, during which the Commons leader had discussed London Fire Brigadeapossaposstay-putapos policy and said: If you just ignore what youaposre told and leave you are so much safer. I thinkeither of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do, and it is such a tragedy that that didnapost happen. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen defended the Commons leaderaposs comments, suggesting he would have made a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice.    And he said: We want very clever people running the country, donapost we  He told BBC Radio ’s PM programme: He is an extremely intelligent and compassionate human being and his comments regarding Grenfell were uncharacteristically clumsy but we have to put them into the context of Jacob. Jacob is a leader, he is an authority figure and what he has failed to realise is that in a le-threatening and stressful situation most people, most of the public, will probably defer to the advice of an authority figure – be that someone from the fire authority or the police – and not come to their own conclusions. As we know with regard to Grenfell, that advice was flawed. Host Evan Davies told Mr Bridgen people had taken issue with the suggestion that Mr Rees-Mogg would not have died because he was cleverer than the people who took the fire brigadeaposs advice, Mr Bridgen said: But we want very clever people running the country, don’t we, Evan  That is a by-product of what Jacob is and that is why he is in a position of authority. What he’s actually saying is that he would have given a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice.   Labour MP David Lammy called on Mr Rees-Mogg to resign.He said: “I’m disgusted, shocked. I’m thinking about those poor people who lost their lives, including my friend Khadija. When you look through the report, it’s clear that many of them stayed put because they were advised to do so. To describe them as lacking common sense is not just insensitive, it’s unforgiveable. These are people who had been complaining - about the building, the renovation, the conditions they were living in. It’s clear that there was flammable cladding. We find out that there were firemen who could have knocked on doors, who didn’t. All the rest of it.

We wanted to look after our family and friends.    “That’s the best feeling. But we knew we had to make long-term plans for the children. “We got financial advice, and knew we had to be careful. They may not be independent, so there’ll have to be support.” Darren said he did miss the routine of work but added: “Friends told me, ‘You don’t get that Sunday afternoon dread or Monday morning blues!’” Mum Stella, , elected to stay in the family home, and his brother Troy, , has their old house.

She writes: If Her Majesty is due to attend an engagement in particularly cold weather , from  onwards fake fur will be used to make sure she stays warm.  Humane Society Internationalaposs Claire Bass told the: We are thrilled that Her Majesty has officially gone fur-free. Queen Elizabeth’s decision to aposgo fauxapos is the perfect reflection of the mood of the British public, the vast majority of whom detest cruel fur, and want nothing to do with it.Our Head of State going fur-free sends a powerful message that fur is firmly out of fashion and does not belong with Brand Britain. The UK banned fur farming almost two decades ago because it was deemed too cruel, now we must finish the job and ban fur sales too.Back in  the Queen was criticised for wearing a long brown fur coat on Christmas morning .

Fur farming was banned in  because itaposs a cruel industry that no longer represents British values.

The organisations has issued a rain weather warning for north-east England from am tomorrow to am on Friday.Up to mm of rain could hit parts of Yorkshire, bringing almost three quarters of the mm average rain total for November in one day. The Met Office alert says there is a chance some communities could become cut off by flooded roads, in addition to potential public transport disruption. The warning states: Rain, prolonged and occasionally heavy, will affect much of Yorkshire, along with parts of northeast of England and the north Midlands during Thursday.    The rain will gradually ease overnight and clear away during the early hours of Friday. - mm of rain is expected over quite a wide area, with - mm falling in a few locations over high ground, through the period. The Environment Agency said flooding is possible - but not expected - on Thursday and Friday. A flooding forecast by the organisation states: Widespread surface water and river flooding is possible but not expected on Thursday and Friday as rain falls on already wet ground across parts of the north of England, the Midlands and Lincolnshire. Local flooding is also possible more widely across the Midlands, East Anglia and the north of England. Properties may flood and there may be travel disruption.  It will be a chilly start for many this morning, with temperatures of C in central England and even lower in parts of Scotland. The mercury is not expected to climb above C and will dip down to C in the north this evening. Tonight will be cloudy with patchy rain in the evening for many, especially central and western areas. However it will be dry for a time in northern Scotland and south-east England. Through the night it will become cloudy with showers or longer spells of rain for most, with snow likely over the hills of Scotland, particularly the Grampians. Tomorrow will be mostly cloudy with outbreaks of rain in Northern Ireland, southern and eastern Scotland.    There will be rain at times too in England and Wales, although there will be occasional bright spells in south Wales and south-west England. Further snow once again expected in the high grounds of Scotland, with temperatures dropping to freezing. It will be chilly but mostly dry with sunny spells on Friday, after any early rain clears away from south-east England.

By accusing the tower block’s residents of lacking common sense, the Cabinet minister betrays his contempt for the public. Another such moment is an outraged rape victim demanding the resignation of Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns. A leaked email has contradicted the senior Tory’s claim he didn’t know about a Conservative candidate – his former aide – causing the trial of her alleged rapist to collapse. The backlash against Tories who care little for little people leaves Boris Johnson, a PM out of touch himself, looking more cynical than ever with his endless  Brexit promises. Rees-Mogg’s callousness wasn’t just about Grenfell.  It exposed an arrogant Conservative Party mindset, sneering at ordinary folk and blaming them for the effects of the Tories’ own ideology of deregulation and austerity. Labour’s demand for real change looks more compelling than ever.

But working in the gig economy left the couple exhausted and struggling to budget. Joanne, , and Joe, , from south Yorkshire, accepted zero hours roles picking and packing warehouse items for a large online retailer, via an agency. “When I took the job I was told it was a -hour week, but they cancelled shts at short notice. You get a text the day before,” Joanne says. “You don’t get paid for those days, soyou’ve got childcare booked you end up paying out but not earning anything. Trying to budget is just impossible. In the whole seven weeks I was there, I earned only £,..”  Stacey Francis , , found similar problems when she took on packing work near her home in Harrogate. “You never knew what hours you were doing from one day to the next,” she says. “I was on the minimum wage and really needed the job but I’d never do that kind of work again. You don’t have any proper rights.”  A new film,  Sorry We Missed You , from the team that made  I, Daniel Blake , is released in cinemas from today. It reveals the pressures faced by gig economy workers, including those packing orders for online and other retailers. One in five of these warehouse workers in the UK is a EU migrant, making them especially vulnerable to exploitation. As Joe, a trained chef, explains, he and his colleagues were under huge stress. “It’s slave labour,” he says. “They check you all the time, every hour sometimes, to make sure you’re picking enough items.  “People would be called up to the third floor then you’d never see them again. They’d been sacked, mid-sht at am and left to walk home.” A  TUC report makes it clear that workers like Joanne, Stacey and Joe are being denied basic rights – and that the gig economy model is broken, saying: “Employers have sought to manage the financial risk that comes from the inability to guarantee a constant demand for a product or service by employing workers on contracts that offer flexibility for the employer, at the expense of pay and certainty for the employee.” New film exposes grim work reality "},{"url":null,"title":"couple sell everything live debt","story":"NewsCouple sell everything they own to live debt-free on bus with daughter and dogWill Watson and we Kristin, from Jacksonville, Florida, have been keen adventurers since they were childrenShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  NOV NewsWill Watson and we Kristins baby Roam has travelled more than , with them \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

You can’t say: ‘Don’t worry about it boys, we can just turn up and we’ll get the right calls this time’.“You need to put your stamp on the match and hurt whoever you are playing. They will be thinking the same. The talk will not be about that game. It will be about this match and what it means to us as a club.”The Dens gaffer is in no doubt his side are a “stronger group” this time around.And he points to the quality that’s been added since in the shape of former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans.“I would say we are a stronger group,” James said.“We have added quality to the group. However, United will be stronger, too, because, although they didn’t make wholesale changes, they have been able to work with their players and they have been on a good run.“I think the benefits we have had on the training ground they will have had as well.“They may not have needed as much work but we felt we did need to put in the work on the training field in terms of how we go about things.“I think you can see that and, hopefully, you will see it on Friday night again.”He added: “I still don’t think we are completely there.“I don’t knowI will ever think that. In terms of training and that, then yes.“The international break came at a good time for us because we hadn’t yet had the chance to integrate Graham Dorrans into the squad.“We also had Jamie Ness coming back so it was a really good time to get a week’s training done.“Then we have had the games coming in thick and fast and you can see the benefit of that week.“The boys have been getting to know each other and what’s good and their strengths.“It is tough to just tell them that, you need to work on it day in, day out on the training field. I think even the top teams will tell you that.“Getting a settled squad after the window shut and being able to work with the boys – that has certainly helped us.”Meanwhile, the Dens boss is hopeful left-back Jordan Marshall will be fit to start on Friday after he limped off early in the - win over Morton last week.James said: “He is OK, I think. We left him out of training yesterday but he is gradually getting better. Hopefully, we caught it at the right time.“He did look a bit tired the other night, as did some others. We are asking Jordan and the others to press hard in the game but, hopefully, he will be all right.“The fans have taken to him and I can see why.

defeat suffered at Cappielow five weeks ago where Forster feels the Dark Blues let a result slip through their grip.The big centre-back reckons the squad has come a long way since then but knows Dundee must be wary of David Hopkin’s men.He added: “If you look at the last game you can see we limited Morton to very few chances and they scored from a set-piece.“They are a big strong team so credit to them for that because they must work on set-pieces and they put the ball in the box at every opportunity.“That’s their style and it worked that day. But I think we had more than enough chances to win the game comfortably.“Since then we have been a lot more clinical so we’re looking forward to tonight and we’re confident we will come away with three points.”Playing tonight also gives Dundee the chance to get a headstart on their rivals at the top end of the Championship table.Three points would put them above Inverness ahead of Caley Thistle’s home match with Dundee United and level with Ayr.With top and third playing each other it is a chance to make up some ground on at least one of them but onlythey can pick up the victory.Forster added: “It can be a good thing and a bad thing playing first, depending on which side of the fence you are looking from. For us, we are looking to go and win the game, get three points and try to put a bit of pressure on the other teams who are playing tomorrow.“We obviously had the game on Tuesday but we’ve recovered well and worked a bit on what we are planning to do on the pitch tonight through the week.“We are looking forward to it, we have a bit of momentum and we are looking to try to keep that going.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48108931-240x180.jpg

before an accident at work changed his le in .Fast-forward four years – and the former road worker contemplates taking his own le every single day.A visibly distressed Scott today revealed he has dealt with a tumultuous few years that have transformed his le.The death of his sister Jennie Cameron was among a number of family losses in a short period of time.Her brave battle against cancer was documented in the Eveningbefore she died on the day she was due to be married in September .Scott was admitted to Carseview the following month after attempting to take his own le.Now the former St Saviour’s High pupil is urging for greater aftercare support for those struggling with mental health issues.He said: “Since I had an accident at work it has sort of spiralled from there.“From being a man who used to work to support his family to being like this is incredibly hard to take.“I was in Carseview on two separate occasions the month that I attempted to take my own le.“I still have suicidal thoughts daily.”His fiancée, Cheryl, had to become his carer as the family attempted to rebuild their le in Brechin.An unfortunate brush with the law had seen Scott appear in court earlier this year.The police found a haul of antique knives in his car on Fairbairn Street.Dundee Sherf Court heard Scott was encouraged to start collecting knives by his mental health nurses when he was staying at the Carseview Centre.Scott added: “I had just bought the antique knives that day.“It was a case of wrong place, wrong time, after dropping off a family friend.“That pending court case didn’t help with my on-going issues.”Scott had hoped with the support of the community mental health team he could get his le back on track in Angus.He admitted a lack of regular support had seen his progress “stall”.He added: “Whether its a lack of funding or overworked staff, I believe there are failings in the system.“I know of others who are in a similar position to me who feel they can’t get the help they need.“There are massive gaps in the system.”Scott said he wanted to tell his story so that people could be more aware that mental health issues “don’t just go away”.He added: “Despite leaving Carseview my mental health issues didn’t stop the day I left that door.“It is an ongoing struggle and you need those support measures in place.“I want to get the help to turn this around.“Although we have things like Mental Health Awareness Week I believe there is still a lack of understanding of the struggles people face.”A spokeswoman for Angus Health and Social Care Partnership said, “Multidisciplinary community mental health teams are available in every town in Angus.These teams include nurses, doctors, social workers, psychologists and allied health professionals.“Community Mental Health Teams also commission third sector services to deliver care in the home and the community

months in fridays dundee derby","story":"Dundee United centre-back Mark Connolly could be in line for his first start in over two months in Friday’s derby at Dens Park.However, the -year-old will have his work cut out to displace the backline that defended so solidly in Saturday’s - win at Inverness .At the weekend, Connolly made histo first-team duties from the bench since tearing his hamstring in the last derby, a - win over rivals Dundee, on August .And boss Robbie Neilson says he could be ready for a starting spot at Dens on Friday.He said: “Mark has a reserve game tomorrow but we felt it was a good opportunity with a few minutes to go to get him out there and get him some first-team game time.“If he comes back in again, he’s had that bit of a test on his hamstring.“He’s trained magnicently and I think he’s in the best condition I’ve ever seen him, even when he was a kid at Kilmarnock. He’s really looking after himself and has been a great example to everyone so we just wanted to get him back on the pitch.”Goals from strikers Nicky Clark and Lawrence Shankland added to a first-half own goal by Caley Thistle defender Shaun Rooney as United racked up an impressive - victory in the Highlands.The goalscorers may get the plaudits but the Tannadice gaffer was delighted with the work done by his backline, giving Connolly some work to do to earn back his starting spot.Robbie added: “When you go to a place like Inverness, the backline is the most important thing for you.“Inverness put the ball up to Jordan White right on top of your back four and it can be easy to drop off. But I thought our two centre-backs and full-backs kept the game nice and tight which allowed us to get pressure on the midfield. That allowed us to push on.”Caley Thistle boss John Robertson felt Shankland could have been red-carded in the first half for an elbow on Jamie McCart.He said: “The assistant is standing  yards away and should have seen a clear elbow. It’s a tangle and maybe Lawrence is trying to free himself but, accidental or not, he has caught him with his elbow.”Robbie said: “Shanks has just tried to barge him back out of the way. The linesman was  yards away and the ref  yards away. The swarming of the referee blows everything out of proportion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"tell-us-old-steamie-memories-win-tickets-classic-show","story":"GLASGOWS old steamies prompt many a memory for those, like Mary McCusker, who remember when they were found in all of the city neighbourhoods."},{"url":null,"title":"notre-dames-pupils-speak-keep-us-unique-keep-us-all-girls","story":"PUPILS from Notre Dame High School will hold a peaceful protest outside Glasgow City Chambers to tell councillors to \"Keep us all-girls\"."},{"url":null,"title":"generous-glasgow-girl-8-gives-birthday-fundraise-disability-charity","story":"A generousyoung Glasgow girl is planning to celebrate her birthday with a twist ndash by raising money for a charity that has supports her disabled cousin."},{"url":null,"title":"thief-forcibly-drags-girl-15-seat-carjacking","story":"A THIEF forcibly dragged a teenage girl from a passenger seat during a broad-daylight carjacking."},{"url":null,"title":"marks-spencer-hiring-christmas-staff-glasgow---apply","story":"Marks  Spencer are on the lookout for  seasonal staff in Glasgow to help get busy families ready for the festive season."},{"url":null,"title":"south-lanarkshire-council-leader-apologises-ram-yer-union-yer-hoop-tweet","story":"A Scottish council leader has been slammed for a controversial tweet featuring a banner with the message ldquoRam yer union up yer hoop."},{"url":null,"title":"party-time-glasgow-decides-mps","story":"VOTERS in Glasgow will elect seven MPs at the General Election next month."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-former-notre-dame-high-school-pupil-speaks","story":"Mothercare collapse"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-casino-set-facelift","story":"A GLASGOW casino is set to undergo a multi-million pound revamp incorporating a Chinese theme."},{"url":null,"title":"drivers-paying-nose-stations","story":"Commuters in Glasgow are facing huge parking billsthey choose to park and ride on trains across the country."},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/19303383.jpg ","title":"main aims for lethal strike duo alongside cosgrove","story":"Buoyed by his first competitive Aberdeen goal, Curtis Main is confident he can forge a lethal strike partnership with Sam Cosgrove.Summer signing Main admits to frustration at both his lack of goaland game time since moving to Pittodrie.Chances have been limited and he was also hit by setbacks such as the dismissal last month against Hibs which he maintains was not a red card.Aberdeen opted not to appeal that sending-off and any momentum Main hoped to build was subsequently derailed by a two-game ban.However, the -year-old was given another opportunity when pitched in alongside prolic striker Cosgrove in a -- against Kilmarnock.It paid off as Main ended his competitive scoring drought and Cosgrove hit his th goal of the season.Main reckons they can become a dangerous duo in attack.He said: “I have no doubt Sam and myself can play together.“We showed against Kilmarnock there were spells in the game when we linked up really well.“I think everyone will be pleased with how we played attacking wise.“It is nice to play up there with another striker and you can build a relationship and work off each other’s game.“We are both imposing players but both link up well on the floor. It is not just one-dimensional.”His goalscoring performance against Kilmarnock was only the fourth start for the former Motherwell striker this season.Dons boss Derek McInnes has understandably opted to primarily use prolic striker Cosgrove to lead his attack.Cosgrove scored  times last season and is already closing in on that landmark again.Main said: “Absolutely, I have been frustrated. I just want to be on the park, playing minutes and scoring goals.“That is what I came here to do.“Behind the scenes I am working as hard as possible every day to put myself in a good position so that when the opportunities do come I am able to take them.“I have just had to keep my head down, work hard and wait for opportunities.“A few weeks ago I felt good in that gamebut unfortunately that didn’t go to plan.“I had to stay patient, stay ready and stay fit.“I am more than confident in my own ability. It is just about being on the park and showing everyone what I can do.”Main admits he has had discussions with manager McInnes about his lack of game time since signing on at Pittodrie.He said: “The manager is open and honest and I have had conversations with him through the season so far.“It is a competitive squad and it is about putting myself in a position to be in the squad and be in the team.”McInnes handed Main the opportunity to impress in the - draw with Hibs in his last appearance for the Dons on October .His strong performance was derailed when referee Don Robertson handed Main a straight red for a challenge on Stevie Mallan in the th minute.Main was shocked by the decision then and the red still rankles.He said: “It was disbelief. Absolute disbelief. I still maintain it was a good tackle. I think the boy made way too much of it.“I might have grazed his foot but there were a couple of incidents in the game where he was rolling round, which is totally unnecessary.“Unfortunately that is sometimes the way the game is played.“It was disheartening because I was in the team and had an opportunity. I felt I was playing well but I just had to forget it, put it to the back of my mind and wait for the next opportunity.“Thankfully that has come around very quickly and I managed to do something with it.”Main netted in the - pre-season friendly draw with Inverness Caley Thistle in July as part of the build-up to the Europa League campaign.He was delighted to finally score in a competitive match for Aberdeen and hopes it will be a catalyst for many more.He said: “ It was overdue and I am pleased that I have that goal.“Now I just have to move on and try to build on that.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/SNS-19607994-Aberdeen-v-Kilmarnock.jpg ","title":"mcinnes hails dons for bouncing back","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes today praised his under-pressure squad for bouncing back from their Celtic humiliation.The Reds were slaughtered by supporters and critics for the recent - loss where all Celtic’s goals came in the first half.McInnes demanded an immediate reaction and set a target of maximum points from the remaining three games before the international break.Aberdeen have delivered six with back-to-back wins against Hamilton and Kilmarnock.They travel to Ross County on Saturday before the Premiership goes into a week’s shutdown for the Euro  qualiers.McInnes said: “There was a bit of scrutiny on us after Celtic and I think the players have done extremely well to win both games with both clean sheets.“It is just a start for us and hopefully we can go on and get a third win in a row against Ross County next week. And go into the international break feeling a bit better about ourselves.”McInnes opted to partner strikers Sam Cosgrove and Curtis Main in a -- system against a Kilmarnock side struggling to field recognised centre-backs due to injury and suspension.It paid off with Main netting his first competitive goal for the Dons since his summer move.Cosgrove also scored to take his tally for the season to  goals.McInnes believes the score-line should have been more emphatic as Aberdeen were denied a penalty claim by referee Kevin Clancy.Cosgrove was brought down by a clumsy tackle from Stephen Hendrie in the box in the second half but the whistler waved play on.McInnes said: “We should have had a penalty with Cosgrove in the second half when he got wiped out in the bottom corner.“We also hit the post so it was good to get the third goal to add a bit of polish to the result.“Kilmarnock don’t normally lose too many goals so I am pleased with that scoreline against them.”The international break will give McInnes and his first-team squad the time to move into the new £ million training facility at Kingsford.Although the youth academy officially moved into Cormack Park yesterday, the first team squad have delayed it.Following the official opening by Sir Alex Ferguson on Thursday, they used the facilities for the first time the following day.McInnes said: “Cormack Park is a huge step forward for the club. It is brilliant facility for us all to enjoy.“We trained there on Friday with the team and it was the first chance the players had really got to see it.“We will train there again on Friday because we are not moving in full-time yet.“The academy kids and coaches started there on Monday and we will move in the following week.”Cormack Park is phase one of a £m plus development at Kingsford with phase two the delivery of a ,-capacity stadium.That was initially scheduled to be opened in summer  but that date is likely to be moved back a year until summer .McInnes said: “The players getting that first sense of Cormack Park and enjoying our own environment is fantastic for the professional side of the club.“However, it is great for the whole region.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out. Someone needs to get a grip of this in Kilmory and at the HSCP.The weather helped, but the Mid Argyll Triathlon seemed to be a major success yet again.

In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to. The senior students were then tasked with spending their money on Halloween treats that would later be donated to the local foodbank at Kilmory.Funds for the shopping trip were raised by a staff pumpkin carving session. Pumpkins, grown by the school#s science department, have been purchased by staff in preparation for the carving event that will take place next week. The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNumbers drawn in Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery on Monday October  were ,  and .

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions. Most notably, George received the MBE from Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace on December , , ‘for services to the community in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute.’Maureen Keith, daughter of the Provost, handing over a bouquet to the Queen after the presentation ceremony.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery. We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site. Nothing will change in respect to their co-operative membership of First Milk, and we will continue to collect and pay for their milk on the same basis as before.#James Barbour, chairman of the Kintyre steering group, added: #It was the right thing to investigate all avenues to seewe could keep the creamery open in Kintyre. There was widespread enthusiasm from the local farmers to try to secure the future of the site and genuine support from First Milk, the Scottish Government and the local community, along with a successful crowdfunding campaign.#Despite all of this we were not able to find a financially viable long-term solution for the creamery.

That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river.

Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

Bruce also appeared to confuse Vote Leave with the Leave.EU campaign.The young woman defended her position, but was told by Bruce ldquono criminal charges were brought.The right-wing journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who was a list, then jumped in to say: ldquoThe vast majority of allegations about both Leave campaigns were found to be completely untrue. This was propaganda.The audience member was correct, however ndash Vote Leave broke the law. Yet, any viewer would have left the programme believing the opposite.This is a critical failure by the BBC. The national broadcaster is meant to provide unbiased, accurate reporting. It did the opposite on Question Time.This General Election is one that will be fought on lies, deceit and manipulation. Thatrsquos why facts, truth and trust are the most vital issues for the electorate.Herersquos a reminder of what the BBC should have told viewers. Vote Leave was fined pound, for breaking electoral law over spending limits. In March this year, it dropped its appeal against the fine. Vote Leave was fronted by Boris Johnson. Cummings was campaign director.The Electoral Commission said: ldquoSerious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system and it is vital, therefore, that they are properly investigated and sanctioned.A day after Question Time aired, it emerged evidence relating to overspending, which could lead to criminal charges against Vote Leave, had been passed by police to the Crown Prosecution Service.The House of Commonrsquos Privileges Committee said Cummings had committed a contempt of Parliament by not appearing to give evidence when ordered as part of an inquiry into fake news.The fact that Question Time acted as a distributor for lies on an issue which is right at the very heart of Brexit and the forthcoming General Election makes the broadcasterrsquos failings ever more egregious.I donrsquot see bias at every turn with the BBC. Irsquove mostly great respect for the broadcaster in terms of its journalism and also its cultural output. When I see it attacked by both right and left, Leave and Remain, unionists and Yes voters, Irsquom pretty confident itrsquos doing its job and holding all sides of the political spectrum to account. Demonstrations against the BBC and hate campaigns against reporters run contrary to every democratic bone in my body. I see them as the first steps on the path to authoritarianism and populism.However, the BBC as a whole suffers from a fatal weakness: its automatic default position is to defend the status quo. When authority speaks, it accepts and parrots, it doesnrsquot question and interrogate. Radical voices are subjected to withering scrutiny, reactionary voices are treated with respect and dignity. This skews debate and immediately sets up imbalance.We saw the same problem here in Scotland during the independence referendum. The knee-jerk position was to subject the Yes campaign to forensic investigation, while broadly accepting most of what the No campaign said on face value. Both sides should have been put under the same pressure.There are also flaws built in to Question Time, which are now becoming damaging to democracy. The show isnrsquot about debate and getting to the facts, itrsquos TV clickbait. Itrsquos about screaming matches and outrage. Itrsquos a shock-jock show dressed up in the boring clothes of a politician.:Election : Jeremy Corbyn accuses Boris Johnson over NHSHere in Scotland, wersquore used to the games Question Time plays. Eyebrows were raised when a former UKIP member called Billy Mitchell appeared on the show for the fourth time in Scotland. Mitchell claimed he was invited by the showrsquos producer.The damage done to the BBCrsquos reputation by last weekrsquos show was immediate and deep. Shahmir Sanni, the whistleblower who exposed Vote Leave spending, said: ldquoOh my f**king God. Theyrsquore not even trying to hide it anymore! This audience member recalls Vote Leave breaking electoral law and Fiona Bruce literally lies saying lsquothey were cleared of those accusationsrsquo.Wersquoll be in serious trouble during this electionthe BBC shatters trust in itself. The public needs the BBC more than ever as an arbiter of whatrsquos true and whatrsquos lies in this era of mass manipulation and propaganda.Johnsonrsquos government is currently sitting on a report into Russian interference in British democracy. Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney-general, has called for its publication before the election.:Glasgow set to host BBC Question Time in run up to general electionThe Labour Party has began to question Dominic Cummings links to Russia. Emily Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary, wrote to the government asking about his connections to Russia and the level of security vetting to which hersquos been subjected in Downing Street.Amid all this, wersquove the truly grave threat Facebook poses to democracy. The social media giant will allow British politicians to run  ads on the site. To make the matter even more disgusting, the policy is being championed by Facebook executive Nick Clegg, the former LibDem deputy Prime Minister, who once spoke out about ldquothe colossal scale of the lies spread by the Leave campaign.Johnson and his new Tory radicals are also shameless in their deceit. Outgoing European Commission President, Jean-Claude Junker, said yesterday of the EU referendum: ldquoSo many lies were told, including by current prime minister, Boris Johnson, that there needed to be a voice to counter them.Chief among the voices countering lies should be the BBC. It shouldnrsquot be amplying hoods. Perhaps, one starting solution would be to change the format of Question Time by adding in a fact-checker service. While the  debate, a team of journalists could sit behind them double-checkingwhat they are saying is true. If they lie, fact-checkers should interrupt the show and tell viewers the truth.

additives and approving substances for animal carcass washes.ldquoMinisters may issue guidance impacting substantive policy content or make new rules governing food safety by secondary legislation, without proper parliamentary scrutiny and using powers that exceed those vested by the EU in the European Commission.ldquoThose considerable powers could be a way to overcoming parliamentary

Eschewing the bright lights, she has settled instead for her own tiny craft bakery in a th century village in rural Perthshire where she quietly and happily puts in a -hour day. Itrsquos from this modest ndashinfinitely pretty ndash base that she hopes to influence our relationship with food for the better.Not that shersquos about to disappear completely: with its white-painted -year-old stone walls, original black range, front door draped with garlands of dried flowers, the setting for her glass-fronted display of fresh craft bakery items, Aran, is the last word in Instagrammability. Named after the Gaelic for bread, it is also the title of her second cookbook.ldquoYeah, it was a bit of a ballsy move, she agrees of her snap decision to buy the bakery in . ldquoItrsquos been wonderful. I call it my flour oasis. Wersquore perched on little white-painted stepping stools in a corner of the busy shop floor, trying not to get in the way of the constant stream of customers ndash a combination of locals and tourists ndash looking for her trademark homemade croissants, cakes, pastries and sourdough breads which have sustainability hard-baked into every bite.Shedden put her studies on hold ndash she was doing a history of art degree at St Andrews ndash to set up Aran with her friend Angus and her boyfriend of just five months at the time, James Irvine, who now manages the Birnam Arts Centre. The pair live together in the flat above the shop. A crowdfunding campaign raised pound, for refurbishment and grants from the SSE windfarm community fund, combined with a bank loan and proceeds from her first book Gatherings, made her long-held dream possible.ldquoIrsquod immediately become jealous when Angus told me he had a lsquobread shedrsquo, a place where he would create loaves upon loaves post-work and early in the morning, she says. ldquoHis magic little set-up was exactly what I had been looking for. It took a year for the trio and other family and friends to get the bakery open.I remark on how busy Aran is, and am informed it does some  transactions a day . The elongated Scottish tourist season means they are busy all year round rather than the traditional Easter to September.ldquoPeople have no idea how much work goes into this and how much we bake every single day, she says. A production kitchen on a small industrial park up the road in Birnam has helped alleviate the flow.So far, so impressive.But Irsquom intrigued.Alongside gorgeous recipes on how to make the goodies in the bakery ndash think Whisky Eccles cakes, pistachio and lime loaf, or butternut squash and Birnam honey loafndash her new book features little drop-in biogs of her regular customers and staff, many of them men, and also of her father. So the female vibe of her previous book, in which she praised the influence of women on home cooking, seems to have morphed into something more collegiate and collaborative ndash as well as less sugary-sweet. Aran follows a day in the le of the bakery, hour by hour and ritual by ritual, and there are recipes for sandwiches, salads, savoury tarts and sandwiches ndash and a heavy emphasis on sourdough breads, brioches and croissants.So, does running a bakery span the genders  ldquoYeah, it used to be all women but the balance is more even now. In fact, I call my team lsquoThe Boysrsquo, she says. ldquoGatherings was more focused on home and family whereas this is much bigger and wider in scope and people. What wersquore doing here is definitely more collaborative. People of both genders bring in ideas and suggestions, either orally or from memory, and we try them out. Wersquore doing continual RD and things are developing organically. And in the village, the wider community spirit is strong.She makes a point of sourcing ingredients, including the all-important flour, from the community and from Scotland as much as possible. Salmon is from the Dunkeld Smoke House, honey from master beekeeper John Taylor, and fresh produce is from the organic Dunkeld and Birnam Community Growing, known as The Field, and from Blackhall Farm. Butter is from Grahamrsquos Dairies, although her Lescure patisserie butter ndash good for croissants and pastries due to its high fat content ndash is from France. With Brexit in mind, she is looking for alternative local sources to provide her with the  kilos she goes through every week.ldquoThe really important thing for us is to be sustainable, she says.Her message about eating sensibly is also strong, and she cites the Rome-based food writer Rachel Roddy and the Irish writer Diana Henry as her food heroes for their ldquosensible approach to healthy eating.In Aran, she writes: ldquoSugar gets a bad rep, as does gluten, sadly. But my principles remain the same throughout this bizarre time. Use proper and honest ingredients and think of food as a source of fuel and satisfaction, not as something to fear or discuss negatively.Kale, which she says, ldquogets all the attention by the clean-eaters, and I worry it will put people off it, features strongly in her salad section alongside squash, carrot tops, heirloom tomatoes and asparagus. Therersquos a foraged nettle and pea quiche in a nod to Scottish culinary history and nettle pudding, ldquothe oldest recorded pudding in the book, but unlikely to make a reappearance.Her misgivings echo those expressed in the  Gatherings, in which she lamented the number of people of her age-group that she knew to have eating disorders or troubled relationships with food, and how ldquoearth-shattering that could be.The equal balance between sweet and savoury in Aran is notable, and again echoes the authorrsquos desire to change perceptions that baking is all about sweetness and stodge.Does she think her peer-group ndash at almost  she is somewhere between a Millennial and the younger so-called Generation Z ndash are confused about food and diet  ldquoYes, she replies, without hesitation. ldquoI am from the generation with arguably the most delusional approach to food. Therersquos so much noise surrounding it on social media. The influencer set are hugely to blame when it comes to diet issues. People arenrsquot sure about where they stand as they receive mixed messages almost every day.With veganism gaining in popularity among Gen Zedders, does she offer vegan options  ldquoA couple, but thatrsquos not something we do massively, she replies, with an almost imperceptible sigh. ldquoApart from the fact that itrsquos very hard to cater for every possible dietary requirement, our ethos here is hugely based on local, as opposed to dietary.ldquoTherersquos quite a contentious discourse about veganism. I think itrsquos doing more damage to the planet than eating dairy from the farm  miles down the road.\"As well as her concerns about food miles, she also has health worries. ldquoI think itrsquos crazy to eliminate so many food groups at once, as veganism advocates. Itrsquos about cutting out a huge amount of the foods wersquove been eating for thousands of years. Problems seem to have occurred with the processed foods wersquove had available for the last  years. Tradition has never done us any harm. Now everyonersquos terried about their health.Sipping milky tea and casting an eye over the ever-forming queue at the counter, she continues: ldquoIt makes me laugh when people come in to our bakery looking for gluten-free. But you can eat our sourdough bread because itrsquos slow-fermented for  hours, which reduces the gluten content dramatically, is more easily digested and therefore better for your gut. I spend a lot of time trying to tell people to try sourdough because itrsquos the best thing you can possibly eat.ldquoI tell them thatthey buy a supermarket loaf they should toast it before eating it to finish off the baking. Itrsquos over-processed and over-yeasted to bake in minutes rather than days and contains  ingredients instead of just three or four. When you eat it itrsquos going to keep cooking in your stomach and make you feel heavy and bloated. Bread should never feel heavy.ldquoEverything processed is why wersquove lost touch with fresh food. E-numbers, additives, colourants, preservatives and so on are all man-made and, of course, theyrsquore going to cause damage and health problems. Naturally occurring ingredients are hardly to blame.Traditional Scottish iced gingerbread, almond and pistachio croissants and chocolate brownies are her biggest sellers. ldquoItrsquos OK to have sugar in moderation. Little and often, she says, smiling. Her own favourites are the sourdough sandwiches made fresh every day and filled with locally sourced greenery. ldquoWe donrsquot do them to order, otherwise wersquod be making cheese and ham every day, she says, grinning.She already has her eyes on the future, and hopes to open a village greengrocers soon. ldquoWe want to stay in Dunkeld and open a village store where things will be properly sourced and we can support the local area, she says. ldquoAt the moment we can only buy plastic-wrapped apples from Spain at the local Co-op. Wersquod like to further help the local growers and producers, while completing the circular system in terms of sustainability, cutting food waste and increasing food security.She concedes that shersquos in the privileged position of being in the main street of a historic village which is popular with tourists with no large supermarkets or fast-food chains to dilute her influence. The local independent butcher, smokehouse, deli and whisky shop are hardly going to do that. In fact, she believes she is part of wider grassroots movement in Scotland that is being fed ndash and in turn consumed ndash by social media.The downside of being part of the Gen Z zeitgeist is she has in the past fallen foul of social mediarsquos more unpleasant side. A self-taught cook who grew up in Dunkeld, Shedden suffered a Twitter backlash when, as a contestant on GBBO, she said shersquod forgotten to switch on the electric oven because her parents had an Aga at home that she had over  cookbooks, most of them French and that she had picked up a recipe for biscotti while travelling in Italy. Such comments resulted in the Twittersphere posting that she was ldquotoo posh, ldquotoo middle-class and ldquotoo professional ndash comments that were picked up by the tabloids.She says now: ldquoI havenrsquot been on Twitter for months. I love Instagram, itrsquos a great way to communicate and a huge part of our business comes through it. It also helped us market our Crowdfunding campaign. It is about sharing. It is far more my vibe and less threatening than Twitter.ldquoThrough Instagram it never fails to amaze me how many fantastic wee independent food places, producers and initiatives there are right across Scotland now, she adds. ldquoI think people are a lot more aware of what theyrsquore eating and where their food comes from. They are aware of sourcing and what theyrsquore putting in their systems. Theyrsquore more interested in that than in price. I like to think that from our tiny part of the planet wersquore changing things bit by bit.Aran, Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland, by Flora Shedden, is published by Hardie Grant at pound.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND BIRNAM HONEYWe do our absolute best to source as many local ingredients as possible, and always encourage customers to come through the door with any of their own goods.

They give birth to a single calf each year, and those that reproduce earlier in the year have more offspring over their letime.This is partly because of an association between the genes that causes the hinds to give birth earlier and higher overall reproductive success.As a result, genes for breeding earlier have become more common in the Rum red deer over time.Professor Pemberton said: ldquoWe are seeing hinds respond dferently during their letimes. A female that has a calf on a certain date in a cold year will have a calf on an earlier date following a warm summer. Something is changing that the animals are responding to and it seems to be the summer temperatures before the rut which is promoting grass growth.After a warm summer, the animals are coming into oestrus earlier, mating, conceiving and birthing earlier but after cold summers the findings were reversed, said Professor Pemberton.She said: ldquoSome of the changes wersquore seeing is because things are getting warmer and the animals are responding to that in their letimes, which wersquore calling plastic change.Traditionally the calving season has been from mid June but due to the altered environmental conditions, researchers have noted the season beginning as early as late May.The study also shows that the rutting season, antler casting and cleaning are all shting ndash and by a very similar time.The findings indicate that red deer could continue to thrive under changing weather: ldquoIn principle,the population can evolve, which is very strongly suggested by the data, then it will allow it to do well under changed environmental conditions.But more research on the impact of winter weather would need to be carried out to understand the final consequences of climate change.The study is unique in that it is teasing out the ious dferent causes of the calving changes, although researchers across the world are investigating how organisms are adapting to environmental change.Professor Pemberton said: ldquoThere has been a lot of discussion on whether animals are going to be able to change genetically and fast enough so this would be an indication that perhaps they will be able to.The research, published in the PLOS Biology journal, was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.Sally Thomas, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos director of people and nature, said: ldquoThese findings are a fascinating example of the impact climate change may be having on wildle.ldquoMore and more research is demonstrating climate change is influencing species across the UK and the world. We are seeing growing evidence of the effects on Scotlandrsquos nature.ldquoSome species are finding it dficult to deal with changes, while others are moving northwards as conditions begin to change."},{"url":null,"title":"everyones-loser-brexit-general-election-race","story":"OK: Europe was always going to dominate, but why do all the parties seem to lose any sense of reality as soon as they talk about it Jeremy Corbyn made a valiant effort yesterday to pretend that Brexit was really about the NHS. Malign forces are gathering in Mordor, in the shape of American pharmaceutical companies, waiting for their Dark Lord Trump to gobble up the NHS and force costly medicines down our throats.The Labour leader then came out with a claim that Brexit would cost the NHS pound million extra per week in higher medicine costs. This was remarkable for being even dafter than the poundm on the side of Boris Johnsonsrsquos Big Red Bus.It is based on a remark ndash subsequently retracted by Donald Trump ndash that ldquoeverything would be on the table in trade talks with the UK. The POTUS was talking even more nonsense than usual, because there really is no prospect of a public service like the NHS being anywhere near the table in trade talks. And thatrsquos not me talking, but the Nuffield Trust, the leading NHS think tank.Nor is there a serious risk of American pharmaceutical companies forcing up the cost of medicines through open competition, as Mr Corbyn claims. The reason, according to the Nuffield, is because competitive tendering for drug prices has been going on for decades, and the NHS does very well out of it. As the biggest health-care purchaser on the planet, it gets the best prices from Big Pharma.The purpose of all this was to ert attention from Labourrsquos actual policy on Brexit, which is not to have any policy at all. ldquoWe recognise why people voted Leave we recognise why people voted Remain, said Labourrsquos Employment spokeswoman, Laura Pidcock, yesterday. ldquoWe are not the party of either: we are the party of both.Therersquos a philosophical debate to be had on whether it is possible to be both for and against Brexit. But in politics itrsquos usually called ldquonot having a clue. Labour intends to negotiate a new Brexit deal in three months, and then put that to a referendum in another three months. Thus will Britain be inof the EU by next June.Letrsquos set aside, for the moment, the fact that Brussels says it is not prepared to reopen the Withdrawal Deal, for a third time, or extend Article , for a fourth time. Labourrsquos Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer, says the European Union will accept Labour terms because theyrsquoll be all about ldquostaying in the customs union and in regulatory alignment with the single market.In other words, this means rejoining the EU in all but name, as the head of Labour for a Peoplersquos Vote, Mike Buckley, admitted on LBC yesterday. Leave voters might have a view about holding a Remain v Remain referendum.Donrsquot get me wrong: I wouldnrsquot objectBritain went down this route. But it would mean restoring free movement, joining the European Economic Area , continuing to pay into the EU budget , accepting EU trade negotiations and remaining under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.But these are things that Labour have repeatedly said they do not want. And after negotiating this spanking new deal Mr Starmer says he would then campaign against it. Those of us with long memories recall Labourrsquos ldquolongest suicide note of . This is the shortest.Labourrsquos confusion over Brexit rather disguises the fact that the Tories are also split. Mr Johnson surprised MPs by delivering a new Brexit deal, with the Irish backstop moved to the Irish Sea. But the UK would still remain under Brussels rule during the transition period and could still find itself beholden the ECJ in the subsequent trade deal.He has gone the long way round Brexit and found himself back where he started. Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party are not going to let him forget that  per cent of the new Brexit deal is actually the old Theresa May Brexit Deal.Tory hard-liners agree, but they are keeping quiet because they realise that,they donrsquot back Mr Johnsonrsquos Brexit, they probably wonrsquot get any Brexit at all. Their hopes are pinned now on forcing a World Trade Organisation trade deal after the transition period and delivering hard Brexit by stealth.As for the voters, I suspect many of them just want to see the whole Brexit madness stopped. Which to be fair is what the Liberal Democrats are proposing: to revoke Article . But there is one slight problem with this: the UK voted to leave the EU.It might very well do so again in a repeat referendum.

Malign forces are gathering in Mordor, in the shape of American pharmaceutical companies, waiting for their Dark Lord Trump to gobble up the NHS and force costly medicines down our throats.The Labour leader then came out with a claim that Brexit would cost the NHS pound million extra per week in higher medicine costs. This was remarkable for being even dafter than the poundm on the side of Boris Johnsonsrsquos Big Red Bus.It is based on a remark ndash subsequently retracted by Donald Trump ndash that ldquoeverything would be on the table in trade talks with the UK. The POTUS was talking even more nonsense than usual, because there really is no prospect of a public service like the NHS being anywhere near the table in trade talks. And thatrsquos not me talking, but the Nuffield Trust, the leading NHS think tank.Nor is there a serious risk of American pharmaceutical companies forcing up the cost of medicines through open competition, as Mr Corbyn claims. The reason, according to the Nuffield, is because competitive tendering for drug prices has been going on for decades, and the NHS does very well out of it. As the biggest health-care purchaser on the planet, it gets the best prices from Big Pharma.The purpose of all this was to ert attention from Labourrsquos actual policy on Brexit, which is not to have any policy at all. ldquoWe recognise why people voted Leave we recognise why people voted Remain, said Labourrsquos Employment spokeswoman, Laura Pidcock, yesterday. ldquoWe are not the party of either: we are the party of both.Therersquos a philosophical debate to be had on whether it is possible to be both for and against Brexit. But in politics itrsquos usually called ldquonot having a clue. Labour intends to negotiate a new Brexit deal in three months, and then put that to a referendum in another three months. Thus will Britain be inof the EU by next June.Letrsquos set aside, for the moment, the fact that Brussels says it is not prepared to reopen the Withdrawal Deal, for a third time, or extend Article , for a fourth time. Labourrsquos Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer, says the European Union will accept Labour terms because theyrsquoll be all about ldquostaying in the customs union and in regulatory alignment with the single market.In other words, this means rejoining the EU in all but name, as the head of Labour for a Peoplersquos Vote, Mike Buckley, admitted on LBC yesterday. Leave voters might have a view about holding a Remain v Remain referendum.Donrsquot get me wrong: I wouldnrsquot objectBritain went down this route. But it would mean restoring free movement, joining the European Economic Area , continuing to pay into the EU budget , accepting EU trade negotiations and remaining under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.But these are things that Labour have repeatedly said they do not want. And after negotiating this spanking new deal Mr Starmer says he would then campaign against it. Those of us with long memories recall Labourrsquos ldquolongest suicide note of . This is the shortest.Labourrsquos confusion over Brexit rather disguises the fact that the Tories are also split. Mr Johnson surprised MPs by delivering a new Brexit deal, with the Irish backstop moved to the Irish Sea. But the UK would still remain under Brussels rule during the transition period and could still find itself beholden the ECJ in the subsequent trade deal.He has gone the long way round Brexit and found himself back where he started. Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party are not going to let him forget that  per cent of the new Brexit deal is actually the old Theresa May Brexit Deal.Tory hard-liners agree, but they are keeping quiet because they realise that,they donrsquot back Mr Johnsonrsquos Brexit, they probably wonrsquot get any Brexit at all. Their hopes are pinned now on forcing a World Trade Organisation trade deal after the transition period and delivering hard Brexit by stealth.As for the voters, I suspect many of them just want to see the whole Brexit madness stopped. Which to be fair is what the Liberal Democrats are proposing: to revoke Article . But there is one slight problem with this: the UK voted to leave the EU.It might very well do so again in a repeat referendum. But the Liberal Democrat ldquoPM-in-waiting, Jo Swinson, says shersquod just ignore that. Itrsquos like the head girl telling everyone that they canrsquot have fizzy drinks.

Based on the suggested p per item charge planned for the Scottish DRS, a -can pack would have £. deposit added to the usual cost price, while four two-litre bottles would incur p in fees.When faced with this choice, two thirds of shoppers currently buying cans in multipacks said they would likely switch to plastic bottles. Even with a p flat-rate deposit, half of those polled said they would still choose larger bottles over multipacks.This could mean millions more plastic bottles being produced each year, potentially ending up as litter – the problem the DRS aims to solve. Alupro representatives are meeting MSPs at the Scottish Parliament today to call for a range of refundable levies to be set, based on the capacity of each container. Rick Hindley, executive director of Alupro, said: “We are very concerned thatthe same deposit fee is applied regardless of container size, it will have a signicant impact on multipacks of aluminium cans. “The majority of consumers buy multipacks, and these will become twice as expensive as the equivalent volume in plastica depositscheme is introduced with the same deposit fee. “This would be a signicant up-front cost for household budgets and, as our survey has confirmed, it will influence purchasing habits.”He urged the Scottish and UK governments to consider the impact of other schemes – the German drink can market is only just starting to recover from a  per cent drop in can sales when a deposit scheme was launched in .He added: “Our survey found  per cent of people are concerned that a depositscheme could increase the consumption of plastic. We must avoid this scenario playing out in the UK.”Unlike plastic, aluminium cans are endlessly recyclable.Three quarters of the aluminium ever produced is still in use today,while three quarters of all plastic made is now in the marine environment.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish wild deer provide early proof animals evolving in response to climate change","story":"Wild deer living on a Scottish island have provided some of the first proof that animals are evolving in response to climate change, new research has found.Scientists have discovered that red deer on the Isle of Rum have undergone genetic changes that have helped them adapt to rising temperatures and shting weather conditions in recent decades.They say the results of the study show Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution in action.Previous studies have shown the dates deer on Rum produce their young has been moving forward since the s, at a rate of about three days per decade.Analysis shows alterations in the animal’s genetic make-up have played a key role in the rapid sht in birth dates that has taken place.This has been partly due to the effects of warmer temperatures on the deer’s behaviour and physiology, but also due to genetic changes caused by natural selection.The research team made the discovery using field records and genetic data collected on Rum over a -year period since .They say the study provides rare evidence of evolution happening quickly enough to be seen over a short timespan.Academics from the universities of Edinburgh, St Andrews and Cambridge and the Australian National University took part in the study. “This is one of the few cases where we have documented evolution in action, showing that it may help populations adapt to climate warming,” said lead researcher Dr Timothée Bonnet, of the Australian National University.Professor Josephine Pemberton, from the University of Edinburgh’s School of Biological Sciences, said: “Long-term studies of inidual letimes are one of the few ways to understand how populations respond to environmental change and how to manage its effects.”Sally Thomas, director of people and nature at Scottish Natural Heritage, which manages the Isle of Mull nature reserve, said: “These findings are a fascinating example of the impact climate change may be having on wildle. “More and more research is demonstrating climate change is influencing species across the UK and the world.”Female red deer, known as hinds, give birth to a single calf each year. Those that reproduce earlier in the year have more offspring over their letime, the researchers say.The findings show this is partly because of a link between the genes that make hinds give birth earlier and higher breeding success. As a result, these genes have become more common in the Rum population over time.The study, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, is published in the journal PLOS Biology.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon pays tribute to brave work of martin mcguinness","story":"Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to the former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland after he died aged .The First Minister released a statement on Tuesday saying that without Martin McGuinness’ “hard and brave work to bridge the ide” that “peace would not have been achieved” in Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon said she got to know Mr McGuinness recently through their work in the British Irish Council and the Joint Ministerial Committee.“Martin will be remembered for his commitment, alongside that of Ian Paisley, to bringing peace and reconciliation to Northern Ireland,” Ms Sturgeon said.:Martin McGuinness, ex-Northern Ireland deputy FM, dies at “He grew up in Northern Ireland’s troubled past - but without his hard and brave work to bridge the ide, peace would not have been achieved.“I had the opportunity in recent years to get to know Martin through our work in the British Irish Council and Joint Ministerial Committee - his deep understanding of both the importance and fragility of the peace process, and also his optimism for the future, was obvious to all.“While he had been unwell for a few months, his untimely death will still come as a shock to many and my thoughts and sympathies are with his we, wider family and friends.”More to follow.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Music, the sound psychology of emotion and feeling##.what can be stronger Bobis Johnson is music to the country#s ears.David,you areabsolutely correct. To take your comment a little further, I would say that the Arts are capable of contributing much more to human le and activity than has ever been so in the past.We are rapidly becoming slaves to science as well as being beneficiaries of its wonderful contributions to le in its widest sense.The attempts that we see to put one on a higher plane than the other are futile.Every facet of human endeavour should be in the mix with the aim of formingrounded rather than fragmented people.Very well put Haydn! The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well. A simple example, Shetland Island Council promotes and acquires battery-powered cars to reduce CO emissions. It only has, at this time, fossil fuel-generated power to charge them with, the result.an increase in CO footprint. How scientically mindless and stupid.Oh and don#t get me started on electric cars. I#ve driven a so called gas guzzler for years. I#ve not seen any so called climate change myself, yet still I drive. It still snows in winter does it not, yet the #green# lobby would have us believe that it will be raining frogs by we don#t change our ways. What utter tosh.Actually Jerry, the winters in Shetland are exceptionally mild these days. You can, literally, count on your hands the number of days it snows. Whether this is due to human activity and this of global warming is maybe questionable, BUT the evidence would suggest it probably is the case human activity being the major cause Is there a connection, overall,between global warming and much milder winters  I sincerely hope global warming is not a situation where, like most progression, some massive disaster has to take place before we do something about Maybe there’s a touch of the prophet in his own country not being recognised.Do I detect a wee bit of sarcasm there, Haydn  lolCan the SIC backing transition to battery powered cars reasonably be described as #bizarre and idiotic# Maybe Ian Tinkler hasn#t fully thought this through.The council#s decision to buy some electric cars helps to extend the necessary infrastructure across the isles, meaning Shetland becomes more ready to welcome visitors with electric cars.The incentives to change over will probably improve and more people will want to swap over.They will need the infrastructure which the SIC#s decision to acquire a greener fleet supports. Shetland#s own generated electricity can and will become cleaner overtime, so it seems a little hard to justy Ian#s claim that the council#s decision was #scientically mindless and stupid#.Its still not entirely clear what self-proclaimed scientic expert Ian#s beliefs and motives are, but climate change deniers might well describe preparing for the future as #bizarre and idiotic#. If Ian can#t come up with a dferent tune, perhaps he can change the record.Perhaps it may just be an intelligent option to wait until Shetland has a clean, non-diesel, power generating capacity be for investing tens and tens of thousands of pounds in an electric car fleet! Especially when tunning these cars vans produce a greater carbon footprint than diesel engine cars would in any case.. A bit too deep for you Peter  Visiting Shetland with electric cars has nothing to do with whatever transport fleet the SIC operate. After all, we have a good towage fleet, when batteries run flat.I agree with Ian. Does this mean he has changed his mind on the Viking wind farm then I see Shetland council have taken delivery of  electric cars. No cars were tunned . They were new.Buying new diesel cars would not have a lower carbon footprint versus buying new electric cars. The embodied energy to produce and ship both is similar. Yes,the electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels it means they are not zero emissions once delivered. But they soon will be as long as Ian doesn#t get his way with Viking. Of course, Ian will not be around to see the worst effects of climate change so can afford to worry about his views. Far more important than the future of humanity, when you balance it up## self-proclaimed scientic expert!!#, your word Peter, just graduate knowledge. Any youngster with Standard Grade science subjects would understand my points, Peter Hamilton. Clearly The STEM subjects were well outside your teaching brief. Was it #Arty subjects# you taught perchance  It is#bizarre and idiotic# to use battery cars when your power source is diesel generated. You actually increase your carbon footprint! Simples. Now ask any well-educated youngster and they will explain the science to you.#Simples# Well that is a scientic proof Popper would have been proud of!I think the personal attacks on Peter and his educationonly make your point stronger.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2479-Portree-Harbour.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Katie is often helped on her litter picks by Eila and her four year old son Reuben She said: “If my little girlis capable of walking down our road gathering up people’s rubbish which they have selfishly cast from their cars, surely those adults driving the cars can be capable of holding on to their rubbish until they get to a bin. The rural roads around Ballymena are a disgrace.”Katie came across the cat recently during the school run.She said: “Less than  hours after we did the clean-up of our road we came across this poor wee cat caught in a crisp packet just around the corner from us, as we did the school run. This wee creature had totally given up and was just crouched at the roadside, waiting for death. “I pulled the bag off, and it sat stunned for a moment, gasping for breath, before it ran off, terried. I am just so glad we found it in time.”Katie said that because of someones littering “this wee soul nearly died, and a family nearly lost their pet”.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme.

Every vote will count in this election and Northern Irelands voice must be heard inside the House of Commons rather than being ignored on the sidelines.\"Supporting a candidate who will not turn up, or whose voice will not be heard is a wasted vote.

So, when I was given the opportunity to be a person of colour on television, I jumped at it,” said Manzano, who is of Latino descent.“And I think I was successful as Maria because I never forgot that there could be a little kid like me watching television and forming ideas about the world.”Over the years, Sesame Street has welcomed many more.It became the first children’s programme to feature someone with Down syndrome.It has had puppets with HIV and in foster care, invited children in wheelchairs, dealt with topics like jailed parents, homelessness, women’s rights, military families and even girls singing about loving their hair.It introduced the bilingual Rosita, the first Latina Muppet, in .Julia, a four-year-old Muppet with autism came in  and this year has offered help for kids whose parents are dealing with addiction and recovery.So important is the show that animal rights group Peta recently asked for the creation of a vegan Muppet.“We are a mirror to society here even though we’re dealing with birds and chickens and monsters,” said Matt Vogel, the puppeteer who portrays Big Bird and the Count and who grew up watching Sesame Street.Ent\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Bert and Ernie immortalised in Lego at Brickxfest at Tayto Park, Co Meath, Ireland EntWhen actor Will Lee, who played the grocer Mr Hooper, died in , the show explained death to children.When Big Bird lost his nest to a hurricane, the community rebuilt his home.To help children after the   terror attacks, Elmo was left traumatised by a fire at Hooper’s store but was soothingly told that firefighters were there to help.“We see a need and we meet that need because I feel like we have a voice that’s loud enough that can do that — that can reach people and make a dference,” Mr Vogel said.Lets all get together and help @SesameStreet celebrate their th anniversary!Catch #SesameStreet’s th Anniversary Celebration Nov. th on @HBO and Nov. th on @PBS. #Sesame pic HuNKyFYo— Nile RodgersNovember , “Our mission is to make kids smarter, stronger and kinder and that those lessons that we impart to them stay with them.”Therapist Jerry Moe, the national director of the Hazelden Betty Ford Children’s Programme, applauds the show for helping children handle trauma, addiction, PTSD, death.“While the numbers and the colours and the sizes and the shapes are all incredibly important, so is that social-emotional development that children need,” he said.“Sesame Street deals with the reality of what’s going on with the kids today.“And Sesame Street does it in such a child-friendly, age-appropriate, developmentally-appropriate way that not only grabs kids’ attention, but also all the providers,” Mr Moe said.Celebrity appearances, starting with Burnett and now numbering , are not just a fun component of the show, they are part of the lesson.Not everyone has adored the show, especially those who grouse about federal funds going to a non-profit organisation that earns millions on licensing for everything from lunch boxes and toys to diapers and commercials for Farmers Insurance.Big Bird in  found himself unexpectedly in the presidential race when Mitt Romney said he would defund public broadcastingelected.“I love Big Bird,” then-president Barack Obama retorted.Music has always been a big part of the show and its song Rubber Duckie peaked at number  on the Billboard charts in .Sing, which premiered on the show, went even higher, hitting number three on Billboard in  when the Carpenters recorded it.Join us on November th as we celebrate our th anniversary with a LIVE QA featuring everyone’s favorite furry friends!

He sent heartfelt greetings from the Christian community to the Baacutehaacutei community on the occasion of the th anniversary of the birth of the Baacuteb. His kind greetings were reciprocated by the MC for the evening Dr Les Gornall, from Ballymoghan in Magherafelt. Dr Gornall provided a short history of the Baacuteb, one of the twin founders of the Baha’i Faith and the example of the Baacuteb’s disciples. Many were killed for their belief.Catalina Suarez also performed on the night with a rendition of ‘She moved through the Fair’.The work of the local Baha’i community was illustrated and one of the Magherafelt Baha’is, Alison Norgate, sang one of the popular settings of the Baha’i writings ‘Blessed is the Spot’, to much applause. Introduced as ‘The Heart of Rathlin’, Poet Mary Cecil read three of her poems beginning with The Poets Dream.The Northern Ireland Baha’i Community has worked hard to put the province on the map and the new film by the Baha’i International Community focused on the work being done.A section of the film Dawn of the Light’ was introduced by one of its stars, Jamie Anderson from Belfast. The film is now available on YouTube. The last and perhaps the most entertaining section was traditional Irish music by the Bellaghy Music Group under the leadership of Leo Neeson.Everyone went away energised and happy. It was a glorious night made possible by the hard working staff of the HomePlace and all the participants. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

Stephen’s family accepted a request from the College to rename the Year  Class League, which Stephen had been a winning captain of in , in Stephen’s memory.  Presentation of the Shield with Conor Glass, the Quinn family and organiser Mr William McAteer.  The traditional setting of the day of the Halloween holidays has since become Stephen Quinn Shield Final day. As ever this year’s final was a very exciting final, battled out by two teams who had met in the group stages when Pt had come out on top in a high scoring encounter. googletag.cmd.push With the full Year  cohort of pupils giving excellent support Ti opened brightly with Dara O’Kane, Daragh O’Neill and Ruairi Biggs all to the fore. Ryan McGrath was excellent in goals while Danny Mc Goldrick was very solid in defence. Pt though worked their way back in to the game after the early onslaught and as the half wore on they had a lot of play but couldn’t manage to get the crucial scores, despite hitting the woodwork on two occasions and seeing two other goal chances go agonisingly close to the major they needed. Daire Hull, Leon Woods, Jack Rodgers and Corie McKay were proper driving forces for the underdogs while Dara Hassan was excellent in goals but the absence of Padraig O Kane from full back was a huge loss to their team. This was more keenly felt as the underdogs tired through the second-half and it was Ti who finished strongly to send joint captains Dara O’Kane and Daragh O’Neill up to collect the much coveted Stephen Quinn Shield. The Quinn family were present to hand over the Shield and they were joined by another previous winning captain of the event and St Patrick’s legend, Conor Glass, revisiting the St Mary Building while on holidays from his professional career with Hawthorn in Australia. “The College would like to thank the Quinn family for their unwavering support of the event and for being in attendance to do the presentation,” commented Paul Hughes. “Thanks also to Mr William McAteer who organised and ran a fantastic event and to Conor Glass for attending the event. Finally of course a huge well done to all the Year  pupils who took part over many lunch times in the past few weeks.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for Void gallery said: Jarman’s apocalyptic, postcolonial depictions of the ‘fall of England’ - reflecting the country’s desire toto its ‘Imperial days’ - are ever present in the current political landscape, from Brexit, parliamentary suspensions and the absence of a government at Stormont, to the rise of nationalism, fascism and state surveillance. We are at an impasse in Northern Ireland and are once again at the mercy of Westminster decision-making. googletag.cmd.push The film references the AIDS epidemic and the collective trauma that was experienced at that time. It was originally going to be titledGBH The Last Of England,reflecting the destruction of the landscape and culture of England, and more personally the body through AIDS. Jarman said the GBH could stand for “whatever you want it to: grievous bodily harm, great British horror, gargantuan bloody H-bomb”. Instead, he used the GBH title for his painting series, depicting the map of England in ious stages of being inflamed.In exhibiting these works,it punctuates this particular moment in Britians political history, to show the parallels in the political struggle from then and now. The legacy of Jarman’s work and gay rights activists both past and present are demonstrated in recent societal and legislative changes with the legalisation of gay marriage in the North.

It paves the way for the Council to engage formally with Central Government to request financial assistance to secure the sustainability of the City of Derry Airport beyond  March . At the meeting, members agreed toapprove a maximum additional underwrite of funding for CODAbetween now and st March  of poundk from in-year capital savings. The total funding required to ensure the airport can continue to operate beyond st March  is a sum of almost poundm per annum. This requirement includes continued operating subsidy , London PSO subvention as well as capital costs to ensure compliance with aviation regulations. googletag.cmd.push Councillors heard how the City of Derry Airport while facing a number of challenges, currently offers customers five key routes across the UK including London, Glasgow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Liverpool providing better connectivity than ever for both businesses and visitors to the region. The Airport, a key employer that positively impacts on local economy through business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m, is working very proactively on route development to build on this foundation and improve links to the North West to open up the gateway to the City and Region. Members of the committee heard in detail about the signicant amount of work done to secure Government support up to the end of March , and how additional Government funding for a minimum six-year period would assist in retaining this connectivity to key destinations in the UK beyond the  March , while essential rail infrastructure investment across the North West is progressed, in particular the A and A. It was outlined to members that the rationale for additional support for the airport would further consolidate the work that has gone into developing the airport and further developing its potential as a vital link within Ireland, the UK and Europe. The move will protect investment in the region, build confidence in our ability to deliver as a centre for business and promote further interest in the North West. Members were told that ultimately the main objective of Council and its strategic partners is the growth and development of the City and Region. The airport has a pivotal role to playcontributing to the delivery of a number of priorities outlined in a series of key relevant government strategies including the draft Programme for Government, Regional Development Strategy, draft Industrial Strategy for Northern Ireland and the ROI National Development Plan . Members were informed how UK Government funding subvention for the PSO route from Derry to London is currently provided at % until March  but will reduce to % thereafter. Council would not have the financial resources to bear this additional cost beyond that point and the full support of Government or Governments for the continued operation of the Airport beyond March  is required. The Council Chief Executiveoutlined to Members the need for Government to work with the Council to provide additional financial support in the form of continued % PSO subvention as well as operational and capital funding support for the Airport post  to ensure its medium term viability in providing continual connectivity to London and other key UK destinations. Members of the committee heard of the current financial challenges being faced by the Airport. Reduced passenger numbers have had a substantial impact on income and changes to flight schedules has resulted in the airport to stay open longer, which has in turn had an impact on the operational costs. Other challenges include - Air Passenger Dutyof pound the single issue affecting growth in the UK and particularly NI Route development, which is directly linked to APD because the heavy tax burden imposed by APD, makes it more attractive for carriers to start up new routes where. The signicant Central Government funding provided to airports in other regions of the UK and Ireland to ensure the sustainability and operation of small regional airports, the current global economic crisis including the lowering of disposable income, high fuel costs and lowering the tendency to fly and the uncertainty around Brexit. It was outlined how European Commission state aid guidelines acknowledge that under current market conditions airports operating under , passengers are experiencing dficulty covering operational costs. Members of the Committee also agreed that Council underwrite an additional sum up to pound, to keep the City of Derry operational to March  as an interim measure to allow the Airport to operate whilst engagement continues with Government. Members were informed that this additional subvention would be allocated from in-year capital savings and therefore have no recurring impact on rates. Members were informed that this additional support will also directly protect up to  jobs at the airport, a further  jobs through indirect and induced employment and a further  jobs through catalytic impacts of business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m and that said despite the challenges, intensive cost saving measures carried out by the Airport Board over the past number of months were not sufficient to mitigate against these pressures and an increased subvention was necessary. Members were also advised that moving beyond , it is hoped that the proposed formal engagement with Central Government in relation to contributions towards ongoing revenue costs would allow Council’s current funding to substantially reduce with associated savings then being available for other key strategic projects identied in the Council’s Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan. It was outlined at the meeting how the Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan -  recognises that highly effective transport infrastructure is vital for the economy and the integral role played by City of Derry Airport in making Derry-Londonderry and the wider North West City Region a more attractive and competitive proposition for inward investors. Its importance in terms of the development and growth of the region’s tourism potential, whilst also delivering economic and social benefits to local communities and the North-West region as a whole, were relayed to members. Members were informed how a key action highlighted within the Strategic Plan is improved connectivity and frequency of flights from City of Derry Airport to major business hubs. The development and sustainability of the Airport and the need for support from government for City of Derry Airport to help the development of new routes, improve connectivity and boost economic growth for the wider city region by increasing access, is also included in the Strategic Growth Plan. The proposals agreed by members are subject to ratication by Full Council later in the month.

It paves the way for the Council to engage formally with Central Government to request financial assistance to secure the sustainability of the City of Derry Airport beyond  March . At the meeting, members agreed toapprove a maximum additional underwrite of funding for CODAbetween now and st March  of poundk from in-year capital savings. The total funding required to ensure the airport can continue to operate beyond st March  is a sum of almost poundm per annum. This requirement includes continued operating subsidy , London PSO subvention as well as capital costs to ensure compliance with aviation regulations. googletag.cmd.push Councillors heard how the City of Derry Airport while facing a number of challenges, currently offers customers five key routes across the UK including London, Glasgow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Liverpool providing better connectivity than ever for both businesses and visitors to the region. The Airport, a key employer that positively impacts on local economy through business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m, is working very proactively on route development to build on this foundation and improve links to the North West to open up the gateway to the City and Region. Members of the committee heard in detail about the signicant amount of work done to secure Government support up to the end of March , and how additional Government funding for a minimum six-year period would assist in retaining this connectivity to key destinations in the UK beyond the  March , while essential rail infrastructure investment across the North West is progressed, in particular the A and A. It was outlined to members that the rationale for additional support for the airport would further consolidate the work that has gone into developing the airport and further developing its potential as a vital link within Ireland, the UK and Europe. The move will protect investment in the region, build confidence in our ability to deliver as a centre for business and promote further interest in the North West. Members were told that ultimately the main objective of Council and its strategic partners is the growth and development of the City and Region. The airport has a pivotal role to playcontributing to the delivery of a number of priorities outlined in a series of key relevant government strategies including the draft Programme for Government, Regional Development Strategy, draft Industrial Strategy for Northern Ireland and the ROI National Development Plan . Members were informed how UK Government funding subvention for the PSO route from Derry to London is currently provided at % until March  but will reduce to % thereafter. Council would not have the financial resources to bear this additional cost beyond that point and the full support of Government or Governments for the continued operation of the Airport beyond March  is required. The Council Chief Executiveoutlined to Members the need for Government to work with the Council to provide additional financial support in the form of continued % PSO subvention as well as operational and capital funding support for the Airport post  to ensure its medium term viability in providing continual connectivity to London and other key UK destinations. Members of the committee heard of the current financial challenges being faced by the Airport. Reduced passenger numbers have had a substantial impact on income and changes to flight schedules has resulted in the airport to stay open longer, which has in turn had an impact on the operational costs. Other challenges include - Air Passenger Dutyof pound the single issue affecting growth in the UK and particularly NI Route development, which is directly linked to APD because the heavy tax burden imposed by APD, makes it more attractive for carriers to start up new routes where. The signicant Central Government funding provided to airports in other regions of the UK and Ireland to ensure the sustainability and operation of small regional airports, the current global economic crisis including the lowering of disposable income, high fuel costs and lowering the tendency to fly and the uncertainty around Brexit. It was outlined how European Commission state aid guidelines acknowledge that under current market conditions airports operating under , passengers are experiencing dficulty covering operational costs. Members of the Committee also agreed that Council underwrite an additional sum up to pound, to keep the City of Derry operational to March  as an interim measure to allow the Airport to operate whilst engagement continues with Government. Members were informed that this additional subvention would be allocated from in-year capital savings and therefore have no recurring impact on rates. Members were informed that this additional support will also directly protect up to  jobs at the airport, a further  jobs through indirect and induced employment and a further  jobs through catalytic impacts of business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m and that said despite the challenges, intensive cost saving measures carried out by the Airport Board over the past number of months were not sufficient to mitigate against these pressures and an increased subvention was necessary. Members were also advised that moving beyond , it is hoped that the proposed formal engagement with Central Government in relation to contributions towards ongoing revenue costs would allow Council’s current funding to substantially reduce with associated savings then being available for other key strategic projects identied in the Council’s Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan. It was outlined at the meeting how the Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan -  recognises that highly effective transport infrastructure is vital for the economy and the integral role played by City of Derry Airport in making Derry-Londonderry and the wider North West City Region a more attractive and competitive proposition for inward investors. Its importance in terms of the development and growth of the region’s tourism potential, whilst also delivering economic and social benefits to local communities and the North-West region as a whole, were relayed to members. Members were informed how a key action highlighted within the Strategic Plan is improved connectivity and frequency of flights from City of Derry Airport to major business hubs. The development and sustainability of the Airport and the need for support from government for City of Derry Airport to help the development of new routes, improve connectivity and boost economic growth for the wider city region by increasing access, is also included in the Strategic Growth Plan. The proposals agreed by members are subject to ratication by Full Council later in the month.

He set up the #lovemakesaway movement and the First Home Project.Cathleen Falsani is a writer who has just released an acclaimed new book End Of Hunger. In the past she has interviewed the likes of Barack Obama and Bono.Jonny Clark is the producer of s Of The Flame and is the leader of Youth With A Mission in Ireland and runs a Reconciliation centre in Rostrevor, County Down called An Cuan.Jonny, Jarrod and Cathleen have been walking the Border since the supposed Brexit Day of st October to be a presence of peace and reconciliation in the communities along the route.Also speaking at the Bellaghy event will be Eugene Reavey.Two of Eugene’s brothers, John Martin , Brianwere shot dead by UVF gunmen who burst into their Co Armagh home on  January .His brother Anthonywas also shot and died later in hospital. The UVF also shot  members of another Catholic family on the same night. Elements in the security forces claimed the Reaveys were an IRA family – the Historical Enquiries Team later apologised to Mrs Reavey for this  allegation. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Under a ‘totting-up’ system, a driver who accumulates  or more penalty points within a three year period is liable to be disqualied from driving for six months. If they are disqualied a second time, they cannot drive for a year.However, the Driver and Vehicle Agency say that it “does not have the power to disqualy a person from driving” and that “a disqualication can only be ordered by the court.” This means that motorists can remain on the road despite having a large number of penalty points.In response to an Freedom of Informationrequest from the County Derry Post, the Driver and Vehicle Agencyrevealed that ten drivers in the county have  penalty points on their licence, one motorist have  and two drivers have  points. The DVA has not revealedall  drivers have been disqualied. Recent figures have shown that more than , motorists in the UK continue to drive with  or more penalty points. This includes a -year-old Burnley woman who has  points on her licence, a -year-old Kent man with  points and a Bradford manwho has the worst record in the UK with  penalty points. Road safety charity IAM RoadSmart says that it has been calling for the government to take action on this issue for six years and is “highly concerned” at the number of motorists that remain on the road with so many penalty points.Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart director of policy and research, said that action must be taken “to get irresponsible and dangerous drivers off our roads.” “Licences need to be removed and drivers who have committed repeat offences encouraged to take remedial courses to bring home the impact of the impact of their behaviour and promote safer, more responsible driving behaviour in future,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since  a no show Sinn Fein MP has held the seat, rendering the Foyle constituency voiceless. The SDLP now appear to be endorsing abstentionism and are falling-in behind Sinn Fein. “At this election, I am standing to seek a mandate for genuine representation at Westminster and continued delivery for the Foyle constituency.

Funding was also secured for sure start and Literacy and Numeracy projects. “The Foyle constituency will also benefit signicantly from the pound million ultra-fast broadband rollout, bringing connectivity to some of our most rural and isolated areas. “This was all achieved through the DUP Confidence and Supply agreement and whilst the Sinn Fein MP for this constituency stood on the sidelines delivering nothing.

I have served for almost a decade as an elected representative for Foyle assisting my constituents at every level with their issues.” Mr Middleton concluded: “For a strong Pro Union, Pro Le and Pro Foyle candidate, vote Middleton on th December.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A party spokesperson said they were “delighted” the Derry City and Strabane District councillor was to be their candidate in the  December election. The spokesperson added: “Shaun has a proven track record of standing up for ordinary people and wont let you down.” Cllr Harkin said every vote for People Before Profit is a vote for a socialist Ireland, for an alternative to unionism and nationalism and for an end to “elitist Westminster rule. He added: The Tories have ruled the roost for the last decade with contempt for ordinary people. The DUP shamefully propped them up to continue the attack on public services, welfare, workers rights, the environment and threaten a hard border. googletag.cmd.push “Boris Johnson embodies Westminsters failed democracy and the elitism of the rich and powerful. He needs to go. We want to bring Tory DUP rule to an end for good. “People Before Profit can be trusted to vote to scrap welfare reform, undo anti-trade union laws, reverse privatisation of public services and resist any attempt to reimpose a hard border here. !Well vote to increase taxes on billionaires. Well vote to stop corporations from polluting the planet. All the establishment parties in the North are complicit in implementing Tory policies through Stormont. They voted to bring in vicious welfare reforms. They voted to cut taxes on corporations. They refused to undo Tory anti-trade union laws. “They have overseen the privatisation of the NHS, the running down of our schools, the destruction of the Housing Executive and disastrous environment policies. They assisted the DUPs effort to block equality for women and LGBT+ community. “Establishment parties here cant be trusted to end Tory rule. They cant be trusted to stand up to corporations and climate polluters. They cant be trusted to stand up for ordinary people. Cllr Harkin concluded: “On December  Vote Shaun Harkin in to get Boris Johnson and the Tories out.” Councillor Harkin contested the constituency at the last General Election in  and polled , votes. His selection brings to three the total of confirmed candidates for the Foyle constituency, joining sitting MP Elisha McCallion and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn. Also Lady Pym who was representing the local senior citizensrsquo Friendship Club.BALLYGALGET mdash A request from the school management committee of St Patrickrsquos Primary School at Ballygalget to provide transport for  pupils has been turned down by the local Education Board.The school management committee had explained to the Board that the  infants end their school day officially at .pm, but there is no transport to take them home until .pm.The school committee requested action because there was no teacher available to supervise the infants who had to remain in the school building.The transport officer of the Board, Mr Milligan, stressed that seven of the children were below compulsory school attendance age and as such were not eligible for school transport.Outlining the background to transport facilities provided at the school, Mr Milligan pointed out that an Ulsterbus had carried the children to and from the school for over  years.It had not generally been the practice of the Board to provide buses to take the children home before the end of the normal school day and there were no Board vehicles free to provide transport.Despite a y debate, the Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee said they could not suggest a solution to the problem.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick priest Dr Joseph Maguire has been re-elected chairman of the finance committee of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Maguire told members of the committee that he considered it an hour to be re-elected and he promised to serve the interests of the committee and the Board in every way that he could.COMBER mdash Proposals by Comber traders to prevent moves which they say could threaten their businesses, may well be turned down.The threat is in the shape of the Department of Environment who have announced that they intend introducing parking restrictions in the main shopping areas of the town.The confrontation between the Department and Comber Traders Association has been long running, but on Thursday it seemed that a solution could be found.The Traders Association had an on-the-spot meeting on Thursday morning with a representative from the Roads Division, who listened to the tradersrsquo complaints and suggestions for the siting of the yellow lines in the town. Also present was a representative from the RUC traffic branch.However, there are fears that the tradersrsquo suggestions will be dismissed and the Department will push ahead with their proposals to restrict parking in Comber.The Traders Association feel that the proposals are a very real threat to their livelihood and are inconvenient mdash a view shared by many residents in the town who have backed the Association in their fight with the Department..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Greenkeeper.jpg","title":"Greenkeeper gets revenge at sunny Spa  ","story":"SPA golfers faced a novel end-of-season challenge on Saturday when head groundsman Lee Cartmill set up the -hole course for his Greenkeeperrsquos Revenge competition.It was essentially a fun event which attracted a large number of both ladies and gents and proved to be so popular it is likely to feature again on the Spa calendar.But the devilishly dficult pin placings did not deter Alan Carson who topped the leaderboard with a magnicent score of  points while Catherine McEvoy won the ladies -hole competition with  points.Spa PGA professional Gary Wardlow warned competitors that the pins were in ldquorather unusual positions but after a number of impressive scores were ed he reckoned it had not been sufficiently challenging.Stuart Alexander had his best start for many months with eight straight pars followed by a birdie at the par four th, but unfortunately his great run did not continue.At least two other competitors mdash Sam Boyd and William McAnally mdash also had birdies at the th where the pin was placed in the left-hand green side bunker.Menrsquos results: st Alan Carson , nd George Wilson , rd Chris Chittick , th Stephen Adams , th Brian Graham .Ladiesrsquo results: st Catherine McEvoy , nd Vivienne Abernethy , rd Carol Shields ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Hat-trick.jpg","title":"Hat trick of titles  ","story":"IT was a case of trebles all round recently for a highly-talented teenager from Kilmore.Eighteen year-old Conor Mullan, a son of well-known Crossgar garage owner James Mullan, was in seventh heaven after adding the Ulstermotocross semi-expert title to the Irish and Ulster Youth crowns won earlier in the the year.Conor blazed his way to victory in all three competitions and crowned a sensational year at Desertmartin last week when he clinched the Ulster title, despite riding with a few niggling injuries, including a troublesome shoulder.To clinch Ulster and Irish titles in the same year is some achievement and Conor has done it in style.The Year  pupil at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, now has his focus on sitting his A-Levels next year ldquoI am in Upper Sixth at the minute, taking A-Levels in geography, technology and business studies, he said.ldquoNext year the plan is to go to university, where Irsquod like to study business, or economics.

Together, we want to deliver inclusive, transformative regional regeneration, strengthen our economy and boost our prosperity.Ambitious plans to revolutionise tourist facilities in Newcastle are part of the City Deal proposals and are making signicant progress.Ground condition survey work is taking place in the resort at the base of the Mournes where a new a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains would be based, with the local council confirming that it is planning to appoint a dedicated team to deliver an outline business case designed to pave the way to secure funding to help build the project.An economist is also to be appointed to help with the delivery of the business case which is expected to be completed in early spring or summer.The Gateway proposal is one of the key projects included in the local councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.The world class tourist attraction proposals include the gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain with the proposals expected to be delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.Council officials are also working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centreand bird hide at

that a le-extending drug will be made available free for their young son who has cystic fibrosis.Jen Banks and her husband Dermot were told yesterday by the Department of Health that Northern Ireland would follow the lead by NHS England and make Cystic Fibrosisdrugs Orkbambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco available to eligible patients.It is hoped that their two year-old son, Lorcaacuten, and other CF sufferers will be offered the drugs within weeks.The initial cost of a yearrsquos supply of the drug was estimated at pound, per patient.Last night Jen told the Recorder that she and her husband were ldquoecstatic but the news still has sunk in after they were called to a meeting with Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly at Stormont.The surprise announcement came as the couple were preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos hands within  days, starting rightly so, with those most in need.The mother of two admitted that living with Lorcaacutenrsquos condition and knowing that there was a drug that could dramatically improve his quality of le was ldquoabsolutely horrendous.ldquoIn many ways we feel that Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy has been stolen from us, Jen said of her first child who was diagnosed at  days old.ldquoThe torture wasnrsquot that he had CF, it was that there was something that could help him but there was a company out there that was pricing the drug so highly, it was unobtainable.Jen believes that Lorcaacuten will be on the drug before Christmas and recognises this as a gt of le.ldquoItrsquos not that this is just a good Christmas present but that we have actually been given extra Christmases with our son, said Jen.ldquoOne of the models for the drugs suggest thatyou start it at age six, you can have an extra  years on top of the normal le expectancy for a CF sufferer. ldquoItrsquos like we have been given  Christmases with Lorcaacuten, that it what it really means to us.Lorcaacuten currently needs two sessions of physio each day and uses a nebuliser five times a day along with  tables to absorb fat from his food.He has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last Christmas.Jen said: ldquoHopefully, by taking the drugs, it will mean that will be the end of the infection and he wonrsquot get other infections.ldquoIt gives us even more time to keep him healthy until the better drugs come along.The  year-old has been one of the most vocerous campaigners to have the drug make available in Northern Ireland.She and her husband planned over the summer to move to Louth as the drug is free to patients in the Republic of Ireland but the sale fell through.The mother of two also vowed this week ldquochain herself to the railings at Stormontthe Department of Health did bring the drugs to Northern Ireland.Jen also praised the Recorder for its ldquocontinued and compassionate support of her familyrsquos storyldquoAll of the coverage made us feel that people really cared and we canrsquot thank the paper enough for its support, added

true for singer Mark McMullan, who has just landed himself the lead role in a major touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Mark will follow in the footsteps of Jason Donovan and Philip Schofield who played Joseph when he takes to the stage in Doncaster for a five-month tour from December .The role is Markrsquos first major performance in a national stage musical and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of . Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything. Declan, of course, wanted to tell the world but we didnrsquot want to say until Mark knew for definite it was  per cent.ldquoWe are hoping to travel over for his first show as this will be a great stepping stone for him.While the opportunity may have alluded the talented  year-old until now, Mark said he is ready for the challenge.ldquoIrsquom not nervous about performing as Irsquom definitely ready for this but Irsquom a bit nervous about the other performers who have played the role and feel an obligation to be good and do everyone proud.Mark has already appeared in a youth production of Joseph as the Pharaoh, having performed with St Patrickrsquos Choral Society from the age of  to .He said that while he grew up in a musical family, it was his grandfather, Seamus Mullan, and mother, Brenda, who really encouraged him.ldquoI knew I could sing from an early age as Irsquom from a musical family, said Mark. ldquoBut it wasnrsquot really until I joined the choral society and sang publicly for the first time a few months later in Calamity Jane that people began to tell me I was really good.ldquoPeople told me that I could make a career of singing and it began to occur to me that maybe I could do this.ldquoMy granda was a member of St Patrickrsquos Choral Society and sang in the choir of Mary Mother of the Church in Saintfield. The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager. I speak every night to my Mum and him and he wants to know everything.Mark will continue with his job as architect while living in Newcastle-upon-Tyne with his partner, Zoe Hunter, who he met while they were students at Down High, until he feels confident that a secure future lies ahead of him in musical theatre.ldquoIrsquom also doing a Masters degree in architecture so between work, studying and rehearsal, le is very busy at the moment, he added.Bill Kenwrightrsquos production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webberrsquos musical will play in Doncaster from December  to January  before continuing its UK tour in Peterborough, Aylesbury, Wimbledon, Coventry, Bradford, Chesterfield and Sunderland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting on bypass plans  ","story":"ROADS issues topped the agenda during a meeting in Downpatrick last week including progress on the multi-million pound Ballynahinch bypass scheme.South Down MP Chris Hazzard led a Sinn Fein delegation which met with senior Department of Infrastructure officials at Rathkeltair House.The MP was joined by South Down MLAs Emma Rogan and Sinead Ennis and councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Cathy Mason and Willie Clarke.Mr Hazzard said roads officials provided the delegation with a detailed overview of the local situation, including the impact of successive government austerity budgets on the departmentrsquos ability to maintain the network, invest in much-needed new public transport infrastructure and deliver the appropriate winter service in the months ahead.The MP said that despite the dficult operational environment, it was pleasing to hear that the roads department is continuing to deliver much-needed improvements, including progressing with the final legal stages of the Ballynahinch bypass.It was also confirmed that work is continuing on congestion alleviation schemes in Downpatrick and much-needed road safety enhancements in Mayobridge.ldquoWe also discussed the imminent public inquiry of the vitally important A junctions scheme, perhaps the highest priority local roads scheme given the huge road safety advantages that scheme is likely to deliver and the Newry southern relief road, said the MP.ldquoI was also pleased to hear roads officials speak passionately about delivering a number of park and ride facilities that will help meet the growing demand for modern, fit-for-purpose public transport options in the local area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Niall.jpg","title":"Niall backs start up loans plan  ","story":"THE founder of a Castlewellan business which makes an intelligent outdoor storage solution has been chosen to champion UK start-ups by the government-backed Start-Up Loans programme.Niall Greenan from The Smart Bunker was one of  business founders honoured at a reception at Westminster last week to celebrate some of the UKrsquos most successful small businesses.The Smart Bunker is an easy-to-use dispensing system which releases coal with a simple pull of a lever to fill the bucket to the required amount that can be carried.Mr Greenan , came up with the idea when he realised how dficult it was for his mother, who has arthritis, to fill a coal bucket from her traditional coal bin.He used a pound, Start-Up Loan to develop the device, which has gone on to win several awards.Mr Greenan has also expanded The Smart Bunker to include safe storage of wood pellets, ice treatment and animal feed.The product has attracted attention for its sustainability credentials, providing a good alternative to the plastic bags usually usedfor agricultural storage.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things.

It will be followed by a QA with the producer and live performances.Across the four day festival audiences will have the chance to hear Northern Ireland’s finest talent, including over  of the  Music Prize nominees, in unique, intimate venues. New locations have been added this year such as the Causeway Lass Boat, Holy Trinity Parish, Star of the Sea Chapel, as well as favourites such as the Arcadia, Yacht Club, Harry’s Shack on the beach, the Anchor and Atlantic.Discussing the success of the festival, Carolyn said: “Causeway Coast and Glens Council set it up over  years ago to bring people to the area when it was out of season. Like any coastal resort it’s so busy during the summer but there’s a couple of dark months coming up to Christmas when there’s nothing happening.. The book was launched by Mary McAleese .

There was no power or water so we had to boil water at home for tea and coffee.ldquoThe new one has a sink, microwave and wersquore getting a fridge.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth. APCOA Parking Group has almost  years of industry expertise. With its , employees, the company manages approximately . million inidual parking spaces at more than , locations in  European countries. These include parking spaces at , city and shopping centre locations,  hotels,  hospitals and  European airports.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/WEB2.jpg","title":"danske bank the top team shaping the future","story":"Posted on Tuesday November  by Ulster Business Kevin Kingston, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett speak to John Mulgrew Danske Bank has made a big move in creating two deputy chief executiveroles to help boost business, engagement and further bolster a strong public face for the organisation. Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
