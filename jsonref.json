Photographer Julia Zabrodzka presents this little-known part of modern Mayan cultureby Bartlomiej Kaftan, photography by Julia ZabrodzkaAngelica Cardona, with a microphone in her hand, stands among a group of candidates. Her voice reverberates firmly from the stage: “The art of weaving forms part of our Mayan identity. Nowadays, however, cheap printed fabrics are replacing our ancestral hand-woven textiles. This is how capitalism is killing our culture and preventing us from putting our heart in each artisanal piece we produce.” Her last words sound like a cry of protest. Seems rather like a leftwing party’s rally than a beauty pageant, doesn’t it? Well, indigenous queen elections are not typical beauty contests.They may at first seem similar to Miss Universe events but differ from them in many ways. There are crowns awarded to the winners, but adorned with Maya glyphs and symbols rather than glitzy jewels. There are teenage candidates boasting their best dresses, but made of hand-woven cloth with patterns characteristic to their villages rather than silk or satin. And there is a jury, but its decision is based on the candidates’ knowledge of indigenous culture and the ability to give a powerful and meaningful speech rather than their physical beauty or measurements.Originally this was her only task. First contests were organised as early as in the 1920s and their winners were supposed to adorn a parade at a local festivity. Reinas indígenas, as they are called in Guatemala, still do that but their status has changed substantially. Nowadays they are regarded as ambassadors of their communities. They visit other towns during their elections and represent their own community’s attire and traditions. They often give speeches on subjects such as women’s rights or discrimination. And they are expected to work for their community – in many different ways.“Once I got invited to a neighbour’s family celebration. He asked me to give a speech to his daughters and cousins, encouraging them to stay at school and warning against teenage pregnancies,” recalls Lily Ixkotz’ij Saloj, 2017-2018 queen of the village of Chaquijyá and Sololá municipality. Odethy Tzep, 2017-2018 queen of Chuachinup, organised literacy classes for children and workshops for adult women on the subject of domestic violence, which affects many communities.Sara Elisabeth Mesia from Santiago Atitlán made recordings for a local TV station to raise awareness of growing pollution of the local lake, which is vital for its subsistence and tourism-based economy. And Marily López, queen of Huehuetenango department, is preparing a huge billboard to show the ethnic ersity of her region, where as many as nine indigenous languages are spoken. “Maya people still suffer from racist comments and attitudes here, especially in the capital of the department,” she admits. And that is something she hopes to change.The position of reinas indígenas is, however, not free of contradictions. They are expected to represent their communities, yet get hardly any support from local authorities. Most of them don’t receive a single quetzal to cover the expenses of travelling to other towns. They have to rely on their families’ support. Little wonder, then, that parents are sometimes reluctant when their daughters receive an invitation to take part in the election. “At first my mother was worried,” recalls Sara Elisabeth Mesia, who had to give up her job in a restaurant in order to be a queen. Working, studying and serving her community at the same time was simply too much to handle. “But now she is so proud of me. And keeps saying that we will handle that somehow.”Similar feelings prevail in most families. Being a queen may be a burden, but is also a once-in-a-lifetime experience. In conservative, patriarchal communities few young women get an opportunity to travel around the country or have their voice heard in public. This is something Matías Saloj – father of Lily Ixkotz’ij, 2017-2018 queen of Chaquijyá and Sololá municipality – is really proud of, even if his family had to make sacrificess. Matías says that they had to give up a part of their cornfield to accommodate all the guests of the fiesta at the end of Lily’s term. “We managed that”, he says firmly. “And my daughter could come up to the stage and claim with her head held high: Chaquijyá, mission accomplished!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a060340c8db9412a43e4d944b775573f942a102/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57dc09a408bf99668d5ccf6d58efeaa7 880w","title":"childrens books roundup the best new picture books and novels","story":"A badminton-playing panda, a celebration of the avocado, a travel agency with gateways to other worlds and moreImaginary worlds, absorbing nonfiction and daft belly-laughs are hopefully providing some relief to frustrated kids during lockdown. In picture books, Smriti Halls and Ella Okstad offer a cheeky rhyming romp through a house invaded by animals, including a badminton-playing panda and a tiger doing something smelly, in Elephant in My Kitchen! (Egmont). But the rowdy displaced creatures just want their own habitats to be protected in this blithe, engaging introduction to ideas of conservation for the very young.From Richard Jones, illustrator of The Snow Lion, comes Perdu (Simon \u0026amp Schuster), his first title as author-illustrator. Perdu, an appealing, diminutive dark-brown dog with a jaunty red scarf, is lost, with no place to call home. From countryside to uncaring city he wanders, fearful and hungry, until a gesture of kindness draws him in. It may not be an unusual story, but its delicate pathos and warmth imbue it with a salutary sense of reassurance.I Am Brown (Lantana) by Ashok Banker and Sandhya Prabhat is a joyful celebration of brown skin and wide-ranging achievement – “I am brown, I am beautiful, I am perfect. I ran this race, I won this prize, I wrote this book.” Full of all the different – and wonderful – ways to be brown, whether worshipping, working, playing or eating, it’s uplifting without being preachy, rolling out an inspiring range of possibilities.Meanwhile Avocado Asks (Orchard) by debut illustrator Momoko Abe is a delightful, boldly graphic wander down the supermarket aisles, as Avocado asks: “What am I?” Fruit or veg, cheese or egg … Avocado’s quest for self-knowledge eventually brings him to the exuberantly confident Tomato, who declares that when you’re as fabulous as Avocado, it simply doesn’t matter.For five- to eight-year-olds, the Pig Diaries author Emer Stamp moves from porcine to musine capers in PESTS (Hodder), kicking off a hilarious new series. Grandma has drilled into young mouse Stix that he must never let humans see him – but when Stix joins the Peewit Educatorium for Seriously Terrible Scoundrels, how far will he go in his quest for the coveted accolade of pest of the year? Stamp’s new venture is riotously funny, with enough expressive drawings and poo jokes to delight longstanding Pig fans as well as new readers.In the Garden (Princeton), a gorgeous oversized picture-book from Emma Giuliani, features two silhouetted siblings, Plum and Robin, as they enjoy a year of tending their patch. Under beautifully designed flaps lies information about fruit, flowers and foliage. Full of rich words (peduncle, pericarp) and the sensuous pleasures of a warm breeze, sweet smells and the enjoyment of growing things, it creates a consolatory sense of space for those with limited access to the outside world.For seven-plus, Jack Noel’s Comic Classics: Great Expectations (Egmont) is a comic book exploration of the adventures of Pip, Miss Havisham, Magwitch and Estella, featuring much of the original language and packed with engaging doodles explaining or riffing on the story. A funny, thought-provoking treat, it’s the ideal way into an author whose verbosity is off-putting to most children, but whose meaty plots and unforgettable characters offer much.Eight-plus readers with a taste for fantasy are in for a treat in LD Lapinski’s debut The Strangeworlds Travel Agency (Orion). When Flick walks into a dilapidated travel agency and befriends Jonathan, its teenage proprietor, she makes the intoxicating discovery that the suitcases lining its walls are gateways to other worlds. But energy is draining from Five Lights, the world at the centre of everything – can Flick somehow save it from collapse, and save her own world too? Assured, witty, riotously inventive, this debut has “future classic” written through it like Brighton rock.From super-readable publishers Barrington Stoke comes David Long’s thrilling Survival in Space, a retelling of the Apollo 13 mission published to coincide with the 50th anniversary of its launch. Written with limpid simplicity, filled both with fascinating facts about the history of space travel and a tensely contained sense of dramatic excitement, it offers pent-up imaginations the chance to leave Earth on a nail-biting adventure.Finally, Kirsty Applebaum’s TrooFriend (Nosy Crow) is an agreeably sinister account of artificial intelligence, sentience and corporate obfuscation. The TrooFriend 560 will never lie, steal or bully – what parent wouldn’t want one for their child? But when Sarah is given the TrooFriend she calls Ivy, she soon discovers that human-like responses lead to human-like emotions. What happens when an android learns to feel? Told from Ivy’s perspective, Applebaum’s second novel is a heartfelt, compelling sci-fi story.Robin Hood: Hacking, Heists \u0026amp Flaming Arrows by Robert Muchamore, Hot Key, £6.99Set in a contemporary, slightly dystopian version of the Midlands, this high-octane, rip-roaring escapist reimagining from the author of the cult CHERUB series serves up a 12-year-old Robin flush with hacking skills, quick wits and a carbon-fibre recurve bow. When his dad is arrested for a crime he didn’t commit, Robin falls foul of gangster Guy Gisborne and takes refuge with the hippyish denizens of the dangerous Sherwood Forest, robbing Gisborne-controlled cashpoints with the help of Marion Maid while his half-brother Little John finds unexpected common ground with the Sheriff of Nottingham. Intensely readable, outrageously enjoyable action.Good Girl, Bad Blood by Holly Jackson, Egmont, £7.99Pip Fitz-Amobi, schoolgirl star of Jackson’s bestselling debut, A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder, is back, now running a hugely popular podcast. She is determined not to be a detective any more, however – too much hate came her way in the wake of her first case. So when her friend Connor’s brother goes missing, and his family ask her to help, Pip is dismayed to feel a familiar tingle of excitement. As nail-biting, taut and pacy as her first book, Pip’s second outing confirms Jackson as a homegrown thriller writer to watch.Rules for Being a Girl by Candace Bushnell and Katie Cotugno, Macmillan, £7.99When “Bex”, her handsome teacher, is attentive to her, Marin is flattered – but when he kisses her, she’s appalled. Her best friend won’t believe her, so, in the school paper, Marin writes an article laying out the rules for girls: don’t be easy, don’t be a prude, don’t friendzone him, don’t blame him for trying. School and social hierarchies may be poised to punish Marin instead of Bex, but that doesn’t mean she’s ready to stop fighting, or to lose her newly discovered voice. A fiercely feminist call to arms, from Sex and the City author Candace Bushnell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15921d171af45422fbd68b4142a026642f70d958/1105_0_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a52767e1ea2f57dca4b0a2eb226eaeb","title":"struggling to read or write how to be creative in lockdown","story":"Are you finding it hard to concentrate, or don’t know where to start? Michael Frayn, Marian Keyes, Richard Osman and more share their tipsSo you’ve had the idea for a couple of years. Perhaps it is about the sexual awakening of a young farm boy during the endless Dordogne summer of 1936? Or perhaps it is about lawyers in space, and all the judges fire laser beams out of their eyes? But work has got in the way, or kids have got in the way, or, more likely, the doubting voice in the back of your head has told you not to bother. Who do you think you are?That’s certainly how I felt when I sat down to write The Thursday Murder Club. I knew I liked the idea. It had been waking me up early, keeping me company on the bus, and interrupting me during meetings. However I would only have to read a wonderful novel by Kate Atkinson or Ian Rankin to lose heart. I could never write like them.But then I made a deal with myself, and you will need to make this deal too. I chose to ignore the doubting voice for a month. Just one month. I made myself sit down for two hours a day and write. For me it was 1,000 words at a time. I didn’t go back and revise the previous day’s work. I didn’t fuss over the opening sentence. I wrote 20,000 words in that month, and, honestly, at that point there was no turning back. My story existed, my characters existed, and I had a routine I knew I could stick to.And that’s how I continued. I told no one, except those closest to me. And I showed no one. As things progressed I would spend more and more time going back into what I’d written, editing, revising, improving, but the word count kept slowly rising. It wasn’t Atkinson or Rankin, but I came to realise that was a good thing, because they already exist.Around 18 months later, there it was: 90,000 words an actual novel. The proudest, and hardest, creative achievement of my life. A long, difficult, painful, frustrating, exposing process. But achieved two hours at a time, 1,000 words at a time.Of course, as lots of people will tell you, you really don’t have to write your novel at all. No one is walking into Waterstones and saying: “I tell you what this place needs, another book.” I mean, no one’s walking into Waterstones at all at the moment, but you take my point. But no one else is going to write the book that’s in your head right now. Which seems a shame. So why not have a go? Sitting here, halfway through a sequel, I can’t begin to describe the buzz. Which should give you an idea of my skills as a novelist.Perhaps just give yourself two hours today. Sit and write: 200 words, 500 words, 1,000 words, it doesn’t matter. Begin at the beginning if you want, begin in the middle. Describe the heat of Dordogne, or sentence someone to death on a distant planet. Then tomorrow do the same thing.And good luck. I look forward to reading it.My advice is very pragmatic. If people are thinking of using this time to write, it is work. I don’t know if people want to hear that right now, but books don’t write themselves. If somebody wants to write something they need to agree with themselves that they’re going to devote a certain amount of time each day to trying to produce words. I promise myself either that I’ll write for an hour a day, or 1,000 words a day. At the moment the hour is easier because it’s smaller, and often by the time the hour is up I’ve managed to get into it and I can keep going. If you sit down and think: “I’ve got to write an entire book and work on it all today,” that’s way too scary.You don’t have to start with the structure. And you don’t have to start at the beginning. If you have a vague idea of a sentence, a scene, a paragraph, the storyline, just start with that. Anything is better than nothing. It doesn’t have to be chronological and it doesn’t even have to make narrative sense at the moment. If you write something and you’re not really sure where it’s coming from, go with it anyway and see if it’s telling you something about a different direction that might be worth exploring.I am “high risk” for the virus so am leaving the house only twice a week ... suffice to say, I have never been more grateful for my work. So, some tips: do what makes you feel good. Don’t feel the need to complete a huge project. These are frightening, uncertain times and you don’t need to put more pressure on yourself.  Use this time to do something completely unique and out of your comfort zone. If there is ever time for wild creative abandon and “play” the time is now. I still have deadlines and bills to pay but in my own time I’m finding real pleasure in pushing the boundaries of my writing without expectation of success or outcome.There’s nothing I can tell you – you know it all already. You wrote those letters home describing your adventures on your travels. You told those stories about the people you work with that made everyone laugh so much. So just write another letter home, but this time about some adventures you didn’t have yourself. Tell us a story about some people you don’t actually work with. Yes – invent a few characters, and they’ll be so grateful to you for bringing them into the world that they’ll do things off their own bat and make up their own dialogue, which will spare you a lot of hard work. And they’ll be a bit of company for you in your isolation. Then just choose the right start point and get everything in the right order – exactly the way you did in your letters and stories – and you’re pretty much there. Keep it all nice and simple, and have a good time doing it. If you enjoy it yourself, just possibly someone else might, too.If I had a pound for every time someone said: “Well, at least now you can write your novel” … It’s frustrating because A, all of my other work has disappeared, and B, it’s not exactly premium concentration time, because working on a novel actually requires discipline and isolation. I’m the kind of writer who’s superstitious about my routine: starting with coffee and music. So I am going back to all those rituals and structuring my time like a normal working day. For me it’s eight until lunch, then until about four or five, and then physical activity of some kind. We may think of the house as ours during the day, and we’re now going to have share it. So it’s important to try to carve out some space. If I am stuck I can still go for a walk or call a friend for a chat. Taking a break usually unlocks something because you suppress thinking about the work and your subconscious bubbles away at it. The aim is a bit of relaxation to stop actively thinking about whatever creative problem you have. Your subconscious works away at it while you’re doing something else.Right now we need the sense of connection the internet can provide, but I would say if you want to write then try to disable your internet for an hour or two. Where I write in the house I can’t actually get a signal. It’s a completely different rhythm, quieter, more internal. But that doesn’t happen immediately. Many people are panicking about not being with colleagues. I’ve been working alone for seven years now and you do have to reach out to people – I keep in touch with friends via WhatsApp – and it’s important to have proper breaks.The reality is you will be fighting against other demands on your time. Many writers are more disciplined than you’d think. They have regimes more like accountants than bohemian wastrels. We can be fairly boring people who sit and finish the book.The obvious thing for me is to not put yourself under pressure to be creative, because that never produces your best work. If you’re sitting and thinking: “Why can’t I write?” well, you can’t write because you’re not paying the rent, or you’ve got three kids at home, or you’re lonely. So I would say it’s not the end of the world if you do jigsaws for the next two months. I haven’t written anything since this crisis started, but I know it will come back. There’s a lot to be gained by not writing, but thinking. Not catastrophising, but contemplating a piece of work that you’ve done that maybe doesn’t work or hasn’t worked in the past. Ask yourself, what is wrong with this? Can I talk to someone about why it doesn’t work? One exercise I did on my creative writing MA was to write a parody of another author. So if you haven’t got anything to say, or you’re not sure where to start, write about 500 words describing your living room as Ernest Hemingway would describe it, or Jane Austen. It’s not going anywhere. It’ll probably never see the light of day, no one’s going to read it, but it will keep you working.In the beginning, I read my phone constantly. I took it to bed with me, scrolled minute-by-minute pandemic updates before trying but failing to sleep. It probably didn’t help that my wife is about to give birth. Needless to say, I didn’t do much reading or writing at this time.Since then, I’ve been trying to regain some distance from the crisis. The most helpful thing was the most obvious: reading less news. I discovered you can use the “adult content” settings on your phone to block specific websites. So now, if I want to read about the pandemic on my phone – or watch pornography – then my wife has to type in a secret pin code. I can confirm this is an excellent deterrent. There’s also the challenge of trying to concentrate in the presence of a disruptive housemate or, as he insists on being called, my son. Even when I do manage to find some uninterrupted time, editing seems more appealing than writing. I can happily spend an hour moving a few commas around. But nothing can compete with the true relief of slumping numbly on the sofa. On that note, I want to thank the editors of BBC iPlayer for putting the Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark right there on the front page, beside the link to Newsnight. Blue pill or red pill? Naturally, I took the soothing blue pill. And I did manage to take away an aspirational life lesson. As an archaeologist, Indiana Jones proves that, if you find something you really care about, it’s possible to concentrate under even the most extreme pressure. Look how he admires an ancient Egyptian headpiece while poisoned spears are flying past his head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f717ad99206515924b73106fb016b5fec3ad5f4f/0_172_5331_3199/master/5331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29641596a01051273024647f3fb0b100","title":"can the uks night time economy survive the coronavirus pandemic","story":"With crowds the new enemy, it’s feared thousands of venues have closed their doors for goodOn a normal Saturday thousands of Brummies would be making plans for a night out with friends on Broad Street, the city’s nightlife hotspot famous for its noisy pubs and nightclubs.By midnight the dancefloors of clubs like Pryzm – Birmingham’s biggest – would be packed. “People congregate on Broad Street and go through the bars and, every Saturday night without fail, we’ll end up with 2,500 to 3,000 people coming through our doors,” explains Peter Marks who runs Deltic, the UK’s biggest nightclub operator, which is behind Pryzm.But the lockdown means there will be no queues outside Pryzm – or any of the UK’s other 1,600 nightclubs tonight or, indeed, any time soon as crowds have become the nation’s enemy.Boris Johnson has promised to set out the government’s plans to “get our economy moving” next week but with no vaccine there is no light at the end of the tunnel for the country’s 106,000 bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants, which will be the last to reopen after the coronavirus crisis abates.“We’re about socialising, not social distancing,” says Marks. “It is a low-margin business that relies on a lot of footfall. We get around about 7 million customers a year, but they spend £15 or £16 plus VAT each.”This week the JD Wetherspoon pub chain floated the idea of reopening in June but many within the hospitality trade see that as fanciful and are focused on how to survive the next few months of no, or very low, sales.One campaign gaining momentum is #NationalTimeOut which is being led by Jonathan Downey, the entrepreneur behind London street food business Street Feast and the Milk \u0026amp Honey cocktail bar in Soho.The proposal seeks a package of additional support, including an extension of the government’s job retention scheme, a nine-month rent-free period for tenants and a matching debt repayment break for their landlords.Without help, Downey says, more than half of hospitality venues and as many as 2 million jobs will not survive the lockdown – and even that could be “lowballing it”. The safety measures introduced by supermarkets and DIY stores, with people asked to stand 2 metres apart, are a non-starter in intimate venues and nobody wants to eat in an empty restaurant or dance on an empty dancefloor.“We were the first sector to be shut down by the government and therefore it stands to reason that we may be one of the last to reopen,” says Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Manchester-based Revolution Bars, a nationwide chain aimed at 18- to 30-year-olds. “Opening with any sort of social distancing is very problematic. We would rather stay closed for slightly longer and be able to open with far less restrictions.”Eyal Winter, an economist who has been advising the government over how to ease the national lockdown, told the  this week one solution could be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve, to two or three pints, before asking customers to go home.Marks says that idea is “laughable” and the only way venues can reopen is when social distancing is no longer necessary. Other problems loom. With job losses mounting across the economy many people will just have less money to spend on shopping and nights out after the lockdown ends. Karl Chessell, the director for food and retail at consultancy group CGA, says there is a genuine fear that some venues have “closed their doors for good”.Even if late-night operators can cope with a long shutdown, he says, they will find it difficult to ever return to profit if customer numbers are limited. “Any social distancing will impact revenues and make it incredibly difficult when margins are already slim.”Pitcher says the nine-month rent break proposed by the #NationalTimeOut campaign makes sense: “The burden is shared and shouldn’t cost the government too much more money.” Hospitality firms would not be in a position to find deferred rent anyway, he explains: “With zero income coming in that is money that is completely lost. It is not going to reappear at some point.” For the time being Revolution’s “best estimate” is that its bars might be up and running by late summer. Until the lockdown the chain served 100,000 customers on an average Saturday night and Pitcher reckons they will be keen to come back. “We are well aware,” he says, “they will be desperate for a night out when the time comes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e70551efd50aebcc478a679cbabcd4de72272d6f/0_304_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7848a0ac30c0fbbfa3a073681d3789b3","title":"testing vietnam contained coronavirus","story":"Before the crisis, trust in the government was ebbing. Swift action and open communication have changed thatAs of 30 April, Vietnam has a coronavirus death count of zero and only 270 cases. While the mortality numbers climb into the hundreds of thousands across the world, Vietnam has managed to contain the outbreak of coronavirus through timeliness, aggressive infection control, mass mobilisation of its population and an unprecedented level of openness.Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnam’s successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On 28 January, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus.In the following weeks, Vietnam continuously imposed restrictions and issued policies ahead of and sometimes against the WHO’s recommendations, such as a series of international travel bans and the compulsory wearing of face masks. In late January, the WHO was advising against international traffic restrictions – and to this day, it still stands by the recommendation that face masks are not necessary for the general public.Due to limited treatment infrastructures, the Vietnamese government has focused on mass testing and aggressive contact tracing – a tactic it had employed to fight Sars 17 years ago. Only this time on a larger scale. As of 30 April, Vietnam had conducted 261,004 tests and put tens of thousands of people in isolation.Testing and contact tracing is based on a four-level principle announced by the health ministry: confirmed Covid-19 patients and their direct contacts (level 1: isolation and treatment in hospitals) close contacts with level 1 (level 2: quarantine facilities) close contacts with level 2 (level 3: self-quarantine at home) and lockdown of the neighbourhoodvillagetown where the patient lives (level 4).Adhering to this principle has meant testing a massive number of suspected cases for every new patient. So far, Vietnam has tested nearly 800 people for each new confirmed case, the highest ratio in the world, according to Reuters data. Vietnam was able to make its own WHO-approved test kits and has even exported the kits to Europe and the US.In real life, this scale of testing is easier said than done. Vietnam has gone to great lengths to locate the virus, even utilising methods that could have been controversial in countries with stricter privacy rights. It publishes a detailed travel history of every new patient on social media and in local newspapers in order to seek people who have been in close contact with them. To increase vigilance, the government has also released a mobile app for people to alert the authority about suspected infections in their area. For all people entering the country, a health declaration is now compulsory, with criminal penalties for false declarations.Some would claim these measures are intrusive and would doubt their effectiveness if implemented elsewhere. This may be true. Vietnam is a one-party state with decades of experience in mobilising its population through wars, Sars and swine flu outbreaks.In the early days of the epidemic, the government framed the outbreak as a war. Doctors and nurses were referred to as “soldiers”, and the newly formed National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control was dubbed the “General Headquarters” – a reference back to a military body in existence until 1975.Not only has the language of war been revived, the military has been central to tackling the outbreak. It has been in charge of coordinating the food, transport and accommodation required to quarantine thousands of people returning home to Vietnam from outbreak zones such as the UK.As in wartime, almost every sector, including aviation, healthcare and food production, has been mobilised and dedicated to containing the pandemic. Citizens, meanwhile, are encouraged via social media, text messages and TV broadcasts to donate to the nation’s disease prevention funds.These messages have not been communicated in a rigid militaristic style. Instead, the government has been creative. It updates citizens via regular text messages and has teamed up with two famous pop singers to produce an educational song about the virus, commissioned artists to create posters, and used young, influential figures to broadcast positive messages to those under mandatory quarantine.These creative messages have resonated with many living in lockdown. Vu Dinh Thai, a 25-year-old Vietnamese graduate student in the UK, spent nearly a month in the government’s quarantine camp. Despite unhygienic water and limited access to the internet, he was grateful for the safety he couldn’t be assured of in the UK. “It’s free and they tried their best,” he told me via text messages, “and who would belittle their country for being poor?”Vietnam made it clear at the beginning of the pandemic that it wanted to protect its reputation as “a safe country”. Yet by being open with its people, the government has achieved more than just safeguarding its image it has rebuilt public trust. For the past few years, Vietnam has had to deal with protests over non-transparent handling of environmental disasters such as a mass fish poisoning in 2016, land disputes, and most recently a controversial bill of special economic zones.The question is whether Vietnam can retain this level of transparency in the aftermath of the crisis. Respecting and being open with the people can only benefit Vietnam.• Trang Bui is a Vietnamese freelance journalist based in Ho Chi Minh City"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c43dfb32afb2e48bd468ae0d2f388b775b534e1a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cea8ae754dff61a6345117955c47d5f4","title":"young people jobless future labour employment schemes","story":"The government needs to ape Labour’s successful post-crash employment schemes and use what works to avert this crisisThis summer, new cohorts of young people will tumble out of their closed-down schools and colleges into a shut-down world of no work. Some half a million will be leaving university, as many more may be leaving school or ending training and further education to emerge into nothingness. If they have lost their entire summer term, they will have had precious little careers advice, most of which was an early victim of austerity cuts anyway. The wealth of research from previous recessions shows that a long spell of early unemployment risks people being scarred for life.Here’s a shocking fact hidden by the steep fall in unemployment figures in recent years: there were always at least 800,000 unemployed under-25s adrift – not in education, employment or training (Neets). Many have physical disabilities, illnesses and mental health problems that have been ignored. Many are part of that long tail of lost youth from addicted or violent families they are care leavers, people with no qualifications pulled into gangs and drugs, and failed by schools and underfunded social services that are unable to pick them up in time. As one employment expert said, “These were the ones we didn’t fix when the sun shone.” Instead of help, they were chased away from claiming benefits by Iain Duncan Smith’s exceptionally punitive Jobcentre-sanctioning regimes demanding they sign in every day.This week the alarm was raised by the Youth Employment Group, a new consortium including the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), the Prince’s Trust and others determined to prevent another lost generation of long-term unemployed people. Tony Wilson, director of the IES, and a former senior DWP researcher, has been watching the weekly vanishing of vacancies in horror: “They are the lowest ever, three times worse than ever before and each week it gets worse.” All sorts of jobs have gone, he says – in accountancy, finance and IT, along with the rest. In a recession, “what kills is not people losing jobs, but the lack of anyone hiring,” says Wilson.It will take a phenomenal government effort to fire up good work programmes. Already Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has talked this week of winding down the government’s furlough scheme. But what happens next to all the millions of employees who will be cast off? Young people are always at the back of the queue.Ministers have no memory: they deliberately forget anything some other government did. They prefer to reinvent wheels, marking their own thumbprint on schemes, regardless of voluminous evidence on what works. But this time, if they want to prevent unemployment armageddon, they should look back to what Labour did, both with 1997’s new deal for young people and its post-2008 crash rescue programmes. What worked was job guarantees and high-quality training, experienced advisers and subsidies to employers to hire those who were unemployed.One of the most successful was the post-crash Future Jobs Fund, a generous-spirited and popular plan. I followed its progress in detail, interviewing its beneficiaries and employers who took people on. After six months’ intensive help to find work with a personal adviser, people were offered expensive training in almost anything. If still out of work after nine months, any employer taking them on was given a subsidy of £6,500. There were strict conditions, drawn up with the CBI and TUC: no job substitution, no displacing other workers, but the creation of an extra job doing something of benefit to the community. All these Labour-era work programmes were intensively researched.The Future Jobs Fund ran for little more than a year before the Tories turned it into a 2010 election weapon. David Cameron abolished it with a flourish he said it was “expensive, badly targeted and did not work”, an example of Labour over-spending. Not so. Instead his action was an example of his government’s taste for policy-based evidence-making – pick your political policy first and invent the evidence later. Cameron didn’t bother to wait for actual results. The academic evidence supporting the programme – which involved following up all cases and control groups, tracing what became of recipients – emerged a year too late. But it showed this had been an unprecedented success that produced a net gain to the UK: compared with control groups “it had raised the number of unemployed who went into permanent work by a quarter – a phenomenal success”, says Wilson. It saved £7,750 for each participant in extra tax receipts and reduced benefit bills. There is plentiful research on other schemes, too: the successful German Kurzarbeit (“short-time work”) scheme offers a way to turn furloughing into a part-time work subsidy. Look back, too, at Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal for how governments can invest to employ: there was no lack of urgent public works after a decade of neglect. But above all learn from the best of Labour’s programmes. Rebrand them as Boris bonuses or whatever, deny their Labour origins, but use the high-grade evidence for what works to help save another generation from the lifelong damage of extensive unemployment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8913062dbffe003851c43ae1d669e1f05d61987/0_192_8083_4853/master/8083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb040faf087daf686e1d50df95c083ef","title":"condom sales plummeted uk china ray of hope","story":"The lockdown has led to a sex drought and falling sales of prophylactics. But there is unexpected light on the horizonCondom sales have taken a savage hit, as the opportunities for “intimate occasions” (in the delicate phrasing of the manufacturers) dwindle thanks to the lockdown. You don’t need an MBA for this stuff. Casual sex does not fit into any category of “essential activity”, whichever way you slice it. I think this is quite unfair, and signals a tendency to attach a negative moral judgment to sex that is so deep-seated that people don’t even realise they’re doing it.Say, for instance, that you have two single nurses, who daily put themselves at risk of catching the virus, for no other reason than professionalism and humanity those two people should, in my view, be allowed to have sex in a store cupboard, provided it is with each other. But I don’t make the rules. And maybe they already are having sex. If the demand from casual encounters has collapsed, so too has the demand from couples who didn’t live together and are now self-isolating in separate households. As a final hammer blow to the industry, even cohabiting couples have stopped buying condoms, seemingly because they are not having sex either – although, equally, they could think this is a terrific time to have a baby. People respond to a crisis differently in one of the more memorable problem pages of the corona era, a guy wrote in to this paper to say that he thought lockdown was a great opportunity to explore a nascent interest in BDSM, while his girlfriend … well, she didn’t think that. These conversations are quite difficult to have, especially when nobody can huff off for a walk (at least, not more than once a day). Condom purchase might be a way to signal preference without having to get into a confrontation: “Yes, I would love to transform the shed into a dungeon but wait … I forgot to buy condoms, and we only have these cherry-flavoured ones from last year that you don’t like.”You want light at the end of the tunnel? You want the first green shoots of recovery? Condom sales in China are back to pre-crisis levels.

First Minister Arlene Foster, of the DUP, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, of Sinn Féin, held opposing views about the closure of schools, universities and childcare facilities. In the Republic, schools were closed by 13 March, but the UK planned to close schools a week later, on 20 March. As often happens, the situation in the North evoked the Irish saying idir dhá stól, a shorthand for falling between two stools, neither here nor there.While the Irish government offered grave clarity, the North remained caught up in the UK government’s widely criticised tactics. These ergent responses to coronavirus established an accidental case study of two separate but overlapping approaches to the pandemic taking place on the same island – something researchers will no doubt pore over in the future.The Irish caretaker taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had spoken to Boris Johnson about the island of Ireland being one epidemiological unit, but the political isions north of the border did not allow for that. Instead, different approaches were taken at the crucial first stage of the pandemic. While the British government leapfrogged over the containment phase, largely abandoning the WHO’s mantra of “test, test, test”, the Irish government scrambled to keep a lid on things, gradually introducing early lockdown measures, which benefitted from huge public cooperation. One of the most frequent refrains here in the patter of Covid smalltalk among friends and neighbours is “at least we’re not in England or America”. But of course, part of the island is in the UK.Border counties are experiencing a different pattern of cases compared with much of the rest of the Republic. The border county of Cavan now has the highest number of cases relative to its population, even though it is only the 25th largest county by population in Ireland. Early on during the pandemic, it was reported that up to 70 healthcare workers in Cavan general hospital had contracted Covid-19, and there are also clusters of cases in residential-care settings in the region. While Dublin and its surrounding counties have been the worst affected, the border counties of Louth, Donegal and Monaghan have a higher rate of infection than those further south.The tendency to jump to a conclusion that the number of cases in border counties is related to the porous nature of the border itself, and so is a consequence of travel between north and south, may be misleading. We just don’t know yet. Ireland’s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, who has cut a stoic figure throughout the crisis, has said it is unlikely that the high rate of infection in border counties is due to a “spillover” from the North.The public health doctor Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, has said such hotspots require investigation. Scally lambasted the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on Twitter, saying the department “is in deep and very hot water over their provision of statistics about Covid-19. I’ve been very critical of their dreadful performance, and now the UK Statistics Authority have quite correctly, reprimanded them.” He referenced a letter from Ed Humpherson, the director general for regulation at the statistics authority to Richard Pengelly, the permanent secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Health, indicating that speculation about border cases is just one element of a wider issue about statistics related to the pandemic in the North.Right now, people are viewing the question of Irish unity through the lens of epidemiology. The pandemic is many things, but it is political, and so too will be its consequences. The DUP showed that it was content to sacrifice the economic stability of Northern Ireland in pursuit of the empty, jingoistic rhetoric of Brexit, and at the outset of this pandemic, it did seem that public health was playing second fiddle to the party’s lemming-like tendency to follow Westminster’s instruction.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s recent (and vague) framework document for government formation, drafted as bait for the smaller parties they need to form their “grand coalition”, having frozen Sinn Féin out of the process, tried on some of its policies, which essentially represent the mandate for “change” voted for in the recent general election. One of the document’s proposals is to establish a unit in the taoiseach’s department “to work towards a consensus on a united island”, signifying a growing political case for a united Ireland, as well as something of an appeal to Sinn Féin’s massively increased voter base.Unexpected events often act as a catalyst for finding new pathways towards a goal. Nobody could have conceived that the case for a united Ireland would dovetail with the now urgent practicalities of a united approach to a public health crisis. But the big ideas we have about society often don’t pan out how we anticipate. Eradicating the border’s segmentation of two jurisdictions has been a peacetime issue, a Brexit issue and is now a public health issue.“Disease knows no border. We have to work on all-island collective basis in what is an emerging crisis,” O’Neill said early on, a narrative that has continued through the course of the pandemic. “It’s pure common sense that we need an all-island and a unified approach in dealing with this pandemic,” Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said on an RTÉ radio programme, after she was praised for the low-key manner with which she dealt with a nasty bout of Covid-19, removing herself from the spotlight and only emerging when she recovered. And it’s not just politicians proposing a unified Ireland in this context. The University of Limerick’s professor of general practice, Liam Glynn, told the , “Anything other than an all-Ireland approach is bananas. We are an island.”• Una Mullally is a columnist for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e937a9abf6ef5acc5bbf087643cc47321302b93/0_173_5143_3084/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2e84bfe104a1458c28475043c7862a4","title":"deliveroo venture capitalism food delivery business model","story":"The food delivery company is a case study in the destructive nature of its own ‘disruptive’ business model• See all our coronavirus coverageIf any company can weather coronavirus well, it should be Deliveroo. The early days of lockdown saw demand surge for the service delivering food from restaurants and takeaways. The decision by several major restaurant and fast-food chains to shut for weeks during the early stages of lockdown might have dented demand, but as they begin to reopen for delivery – with most other activities still curtailed – prospects would seem bright for the tech company.Why Deliveroo is struggling during a crisis that should benefit its business model tells us about much more than just one start-up. The company’s nominal reasoning for needing cuts is that coronavirus will be followed by an economic downturn, which could hit orders. That’s plausible, but far from a given.The financial crash of 2008 – which led to the most severe recession since the Great Depression – saw “cheap luxuries” perform quite well. People would swap a restaurant meal for, say, a £10 Marks \u0026amp Spencer meal deal. Deliveroo is far cheaper than a restaurant meal for many people – there’s no need to pay for a childminder, or travel, and there’s no need to purchase alcohol at restaurant prices. Why would Deliveroo be so certain a downturn would be bad news?The answer lies in the fact that Deliveroo’s real business model has almost nothing to do with making money from delivering food. Like pretty much every other start-up of its sort, once you take all of the costs into account, Deliveroo loses money on every single delivery it makes, even after taking a big cut from the restaurant and a delivery fee from the customer. Uber, now more than a decade old, still loses money for every ride its service offers and every meal its couriers deliver.When every customer loses you money, it’s not good news for your business if customer numbers stay solid or even increase, unless there’s someone else who believes that’s a good thing. What these companies rely on is telling a story – largely to people who will invest in them. Their narrative is they’re “disrupting” existing industries, will build huge market share and customer bases, and thus can’t help but eventually become hugely profitable – just not yet.This is the entire venture capital model – the financial model for Silicon Valley and the whole technology sector beyond it. Don’t worry about growing slowly and sustainably, don’t worry about profit, don’t worry about consequences. Just go flat out, hell for leather, and get as big as you can as fast as you can. It doesn’t matter than most companies will try and fail, provided a few succeed. Valuations will soar, the company will become publicly listed (a procedure known as an IPO) and then the company will either actually work out how to make profit – in which case, great – or by the time it’s clear it won’t, the venture capital funds have sold most of their stake at vast profits, and left regular investors holding the stock when the music stops.This is a whole business model based on optimism. Without that optimism, and the accompanying free-flowing money to power through astronomical losses, the entire system breaks down. That’s the real struggle facing this type of company. It’s also why the very idea of bailing out this sector should be a joke: venture capital chases returns of at 10 times their investment, on the basis that it’s high risk and high reward. If we take out the element of “risk”, we’re basically just funnelling public money to make ultra-rich investors richer.What pushes this beyond a tale that many of us might be happy to write down to karma, though, is the effects it has well beyond the rest of the world.Tech giants move in on existing sectors that previously supported millions of jobs and helped people make their livelihoods – cabs and private hire, the restaurant business, to name just a few. They offer a new, subsidised alternative, that makes customers believe a service can be delivered much more cheaply, or that lets them cherry-pick from the restaurant experience – many restaurants relied on those alcohol sales with a meal to cover their margins, for example.These start-ups come in to existing sectors essentially offering customers free money: £10 worth of stuff for a fiver. It turns out that’s easy to sell. But in the process, they rip the core out of existing businesses and reshape whole sectors of the economy in their image. And now, in the face of a pandemic, they are starting to struggle just like everyone else. It’s not hard to see how this sorry story ends. Having disrupted their industries to the point of leaving business after business on the verge of collapse, the start-ups could be tumbling down after them.• James Ball is the global editor at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fc547c8fb2048437f827acb228947f46034f9b5/0_0_1688_1013/master/1688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=671b84e54afcc54ebaf1fa7d6fda07c2","title":"us iran military hotline covid 19 pandemic","story":"Even amid the coronavirus crisis, the countries are trading threats. A de-escalation hotline is desperately neededA dangerous encounter between the Iranian and US navies in the Persian Gulf last month, provoked by 11 Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ speedboats, and President Trump’s threat one week later to shoot Iranian gunboats out of water if this happens again, are stark reminders of the short fuse between the two countries amid growing tensions. If they want conflict to wag the dog and deflect attention from their failures to fight the Covid-19 outbreak in their respective countries, they can easily stumble into one but if they don’t, as they often claim, they should find a way to establish a military hotline.In the current climate of acrimonious exchanges between the two countries, competing claims that the other’s military is engaged in terrorist acts and little direct interaction between senior diplomats, as well as the US blacklisting of Zarif in 2019, Washington and Tehran need a military de-escalation channel to avoid inadvertent conflict in a moment of crisis.Tensions emanating from the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran and Tehran’s “maximum resistance” response of escalating in the region and ramping up its nuclear programme, triggered by the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and the re-imposition of sanctions, nearly brought the two sides into full-fledged conflict three times in the past 11 months. The first was in the aftermath of Iran’s shooting down of a US drone in June 2019 then in September, when Iran stood accused of having attacked Saudi oil infrastructure and again when the US killed General Suleimani in January, triggering retaliatory Iranian missile strikes in Iraq. The Covid-19 pandemic could have provided a window for a humanitarian ceasefire, but instead appears to have become an occasion for displaying a hardening of positions.With neither side willing to yield, a dearth of effective communication channels, stalled diplomacy and a wide arc of regional flashpoints where the US, Iran and their respective allies are tensely poised, a single incident, even if minor, could quickly spin out of control.While the Swiss channel proved effective for conveying high-level messages, it is designed for diplomatic, not military, communication and may not prevent an incident during a standoff between military ships from turning into a shoot-out. Twitter has provided an unusual means of direct communication and signalling between key officials on both sides. But it is hard to see such a public platform that encourages polemics and harsh rhetoric being effective in preventing inadvertent escalation.While a US-Iran de-escalation mechanism can draw on past US experiences with military communications links with adversaries, including the Soviet Union, China, Russia and Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups, it will require some innovation. In the absence of a US-Iran Incidents at Sea agreement and diplomatic relations, as well as reciprocal designations of their militaries in the Gulf as foreign terrorist organisations, any hotline will have to go through an intermediary.The ideal third-party candidate would combine deep expertise in Gulf navigation with experience in mediation and constructive diplomatic relations with both the US and Iran. Based on these considerations, Oman would be a particularly strong candidate. It manages security for shipping exiting the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman, and as a result has technical acumen and expertise in relaying communications. It has previously facilitated US-Iran communication. And both sides have typically considered it an honest broker. Oman has a military cooperation agreement with the US, and jointly operates a military commission with Iran.In one possible design, a one-star general within US Central Command’s leadership would communicate by telephone with an Omani general maintaining a separate telephone line with a counterpart on the Iranian general staff.Critics of such a mechanism may contend that, owing to high tensions and hostility between Tehran and Washington, establishing a line of contact for operational de-escalation is likely to encounter insurmountable political opposition, and that it may prove ineffectual even if established. But its potential to prevent a catastrophic miscalculation and inadvertent escalation outweighs its costs and risks, even if its remit is limited. Also being modest in scope and ambition, it would not require any significant departure from the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” approach, nor would it entail Iran endorsing a US military presence in the region, which it rejects as a matter of principle.Overcoming obstacles facing any US-Iran channel, even a mediated one, will be difficult, especially given the wider diplomatic impasse and distrust between the two sides. But at this perilous moment, it would be important to try.• Ali Vaez directs the Iran project at the International Crisis Group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7354d64f16a64c54ed44186802c61529ceddfca9/0_5_1654_994/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8de54770a7bc9550553f7424ce64d63","title":"theres a sense that celebrities are irrelevant has coronavirus shattered our fame obsession","story":"With their means of gaining attention dwindling, the famous are in panic mode, cluttering up Instagram and singing from their mansionsCovid-19: which celebrity is annoying you the most? Ever since the world went pretty much into lockdown in March, we have been offered an embarrassment of riches. And yes, it truly is an embarrassment. Whether it is Ellen DeGeneres joking that being trapped in one of her many multimillion dollar mansions was “like being in prison”, or Justin Bieber sighing that it was similarly tough being in his mansion, “but obviously, you know, we’ve worked hard for where we’re at, so it’s like, we can’t feel bad”, or of course Gal Gadot’s gruesome all-star medley of Imagine, we have not been left short of examples of “the talent” seeming to be completely tone deaf. When Madonna intoned, from a bath strewn with petals, that this strand of coronavirus was “the great equaliser”, it turned out she was quite right. Yes, we replied straight back, you’re all equally irritating.The speed of the spread of Covid-19 has been one of the most astonishing things about it the rate at which it emerged and upended all of our lives. It is no surprise, then, that it should affect celebrity culture in the same way. The pace at which artists of every kind responded to the crisis, mostly through their own social media channels, was only equalled by the ferocity with which the public clapped back as they exposed new depths of narcissism and privilege. “Celebrity Culture is Burning,” screeched the New York Times a few weeks ago “There Is No Good Celebrity Content Right Now,” decreed Vanity Fair.Before we go further, it must be said that we are loving some stars more than ever in this crisis: whether that is Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, diagnosed with the virus early and handling their predicament with good grace (or, more to the point, communicating that good grace well, too) or Meera Syal and Naughty Boy, who have used their platform to broadcast health advice to the British BAME community, which seems to be disproportionately affected by the crisis or John Krasinski, who created a “good news” YouTube show, offering a virtual prom for high schoolers deprived of the real thing, and helping healthcare workers get tickets for their favourite baseball team.A kind of rigorously selfless approach seems to have defined the efforts of those who are coming out of this well (it helps, of course, if you already liked them in the first place). When, on Instagram Live (the stars’ favourite recourse to publicity in these times), Rihanna was asked yet again where her latest album is, she snapped back that she was busy “trying to save the world” – after all, she has, among other things, donated bucketloads of money. Now, if some other celebrity had said that, we might not have been so forgiving. Yet people seem to have liked the comment for one thing, that’s how we like RiRi to talk, and, for another, unlike those stars who mostly seemed to have just been lecturing us from a (suitable) distance, there is the sense that she really is trying to save the world . Often, though, a simmering annoyance is defining many people’s engagement with the biggest entertainers. And if you stop and think about it, there is a thudding inevitability to it. Not only are we, the public, cooped up at home, glued to our smartphones, with fewer places to vent our frustrations, but they, the stars, are as well. People who positively thrive off gaining our attention – who make a living both financially and emotionally from it – have had their means of doing so drastically reduced. Because it is vital to point out that the showbiz economy has been decimated: no TV shows or films being made, no plays staged, no festivals all summer, no “events” that even that brightest new strand of celebrity, the influencer, can “influence” from. Whether you are dealing in old-school showbiz entertainment or very new-school social media performance, your stage has been shut down. And so it is that many have thrown themselves at their own phones, their last remaining medium, with a desperate fervour – and often equally desperate results.The ones who have most galled people – eg Sam Smith vlogging about having a “quarantine meltdown” from their mansion – have done so for a couple of reasons, diagnoses Chris Rojek, professor of sociology at City University, London, and author of an academic study of celebrity. If we now live in a world where celebrities are rated more than politicians – and can indeed take politicians’ jobs – it’s because they feel more “real”, says Rojek. Over the last century, stars became more and more intimate-seeming as they entered our homes via first the radio, then television and then, latterly, the internet.Indeed, the creation of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram has just accelerated the trend where celebs appear to us every single day, telling us stories about their lives and helping us make sense of ours. So, when all is well, they can project a profitable relatability. The intended effect is that “you can trust these people and what they say, because they seem more on your side than a politician,” says Rojek.In the 21st century, it is hard to overestimate how far we’ve come in using celebrities to make sense of the world. They have inserted themselves in pretty much every facet of existence, from how to bake muffins to navigating war zones, and this is now broadly accepted as the norm. Again, this isn’t necessarily sinister: Tom Hanks’s Covid-19 diagnosis is credited with helping many Americans take the virus seriously (unlike, say, their president).When assorted superstars transmit messages from their mega-compounds in the countryside, they are reminding us that they are “untouchable”, says Rojek. “Here you are, saying: ‘We’re all in this together,’ but you’re actually underlining the fact that an enormous gulf separates celebrities from ordinary people.” It is true that one of the fun side-effects of this crisis has been gaining ever more insight into celebrities’ home lives, but the gawping has often turned sour.The funny thing is, though, we always knew this gulf existed. We did not need Covid-19 to get a peek into Ellen DeGeneres’s or the Beckhams’ mansions we had had plenty of peeks already, as they invited us (at well-curated moments) into their own houses. The greatest stars of the 2010s, the Kardashian clan, built their behemoth brand round a show set for the most part in their airy LA homes. So why are we finding this so grating now? It could be that, before, we liked to think we could aspire to that lifestyle, somehow. Even a tiny unconscious part of you might still believe you could live like Kendall Jenner. Now, locked at home and with diminished income, the gap seems concrete and unbridgeable.Also, says Rojek, it might not just be a simple frustration that these people are far more privileged than us. “I think one of the factors that is different about the virus is the sense that celebrities are appearing to the audience as irrelevant. The cure now lies with medical staff and with scientists and politicians. It’s becoming apparent, in a crisis like this, that whatever gestures celebrities have made, they’re as helpless as the ordinary person.” Naturally, this is not a sexy look.Funnily enough, so far it seems like the best way for an entertainer to handle the current crisis is just to, well, entertain. Whether it’s Florence Pugh cooking up a storm in her kitchen on her Instastories, or a whole galaxy of singers just sticking to their day job, singing, in Lady Gaga’s Together at Home concert, we are mostly appreciative of good, old-fashioned distraction. In today’s cluttered celebrity landscape, it comes as a kind of relief. One of the most dominant stories being told in this Covid-19 era is that it could lead us back to a kind of simplification, or detox, and this applies to showbiz, too there seems to be a persistent hope this pandemic may yet sort the celebrity wheat from the sublebrity chaff. It is an impression that is reinforced when I speak to one senior showbiz publicist in London, who looks after a handful of old-school megastars. “Eurgh! Influencers!” he cries. If coronavirus does us one favour, he suggests, it would be to flatten the curve of the influencer boom. He may get his wish: there have been reports of influencers struggling to make ends meet, the events they post their missives from having all now evaporated. The publicist isn’t too sympathetic. “I think that proper celebrities – ie people that are talented and creative – might enjoy this time,” he says. “They’ll write a brilliant book or a brilliant song. But ‘celebrities’ in the modern sense of the word are gonna shrink, aren’t they?”Certainly, it’s true that for those who once motored on, constantly producing cosily banal content every day for content’s sake, the machine has started to splutter. Instead, the publicist believes that all this will usher in a more austere take on celebrity culture. “I saw something the other day where someone wrote: ‘Why don’t we fill the Strictly lineup with health workers and real life?’ Although I don’t think they’ll do that, I do think there’ll be a shift away from the sort of champagne-lifestyle celebrity.”And yet … will there be? Coronavirus is unprecedented, and it is too early to grasp its effects on the celebrity ecosystem. For instance, the publicist thinks that many stars have already stopped keeping their PR teams on retainers will they go back to them? Can gossip sites such as TMZ subsist on just reporting on celebrities’ Instastories in lockdown? Still, it would be naive to hope that it will somehow undo the total dominance over our culture that celebrities have achieved throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. Yes, we may gripe and grouch and push back, chew them up and turn them into memes, but are we any less dependent on them? And, frankly, in a culture that looks set to be stripped back for months to come, what other options for entertainment do we have? Perhaps we need to be more honest with ourselves as to what we want from our stars. We may chuckle at their desperate need for approval but it works both ways, says Rojek. “I don’t think that celebrities are going to go away because what we will need from them is that feeling of grounding, that somebody understands us,” he says. If Covid-19 reveals the extent of our celebrity culture addiction, it doesn’t yet offer us a way to wean ourselves off it. Honestly, imagine a world where your day was not brightened by Gal Gadot having Kristen Wiig mutter some John Lennon at you in a wide-brimmed fedora. No, really – can you?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398f7cba9c7748958910b9caa8884c17d444e7ff/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0d67e5da8c09fc28856f42ae72840d","title":"university students have you stayed or returned to your term time address","story":"We’d like to hear from students who are returning to their university address for the start of third term, or who have remained there during lockdownAs universities prepare to enter their third term of remote teaching, some students are planning to return to their term-time home.

Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs.The Indian National Students’ Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students’ group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: “We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven’t got anything at all to eat.”Virendra Sharma, Labour MP for Ealing Southall, wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday calling for universities to ringfence money from hardship funds, which are often discretionary, for international students. He also called for minimum service standards for universities to ensure they are offering students enough advice and support.He wrote: “I have heard stories of international students contemplating suicide because they do not know what to do and cannot afford to eat.”India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around £300 were selling for £2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain.India is the fastest growing market for British universities, with nearly 27,000 Indian students coming to the UK in 2018-19. International students can pay up to £38,000 a year in tuition fees to study for an undergraduate degree at a UK university. Indian student groups and charities say many Indian students are not from wealthy families, and have to rely on part-time jobs to cover their living expenses.Sekhon says his small charity, which usually focuses on education projects, has been flooded with queries from students since being listed by the Indian high commission as a coronavirus support group. It has been delivering free hot meals and food to Indian students in Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton for the past four weeks. He says the students are mainly from the universities of Cranfield, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire.“I don’t think universities fully understand what is going on,” he says. “Many of these students have been doing cash-in-hand or hourly-paid jobs, which they have lost. They can’t get home to their families, and they feel alone and don’t know how to access help like food banks.”A spokesperson for the University of Bedfordshire says: “Students don’t always highlight their difficulties and don’t contact our support team. We would urge students who are struggling to get in contact straight away.” The university can provide care packages and financial support as well as help finding work, she says.Cranfield University says it is aware of only one case of hardship. “Our student support and wellbeing team is looking into the details and will offer help,” it says.The University of Hertfordshire says is it offering wellbeing support, care packages, accommodation and food vouchers and has set up a new fund to help students in hardship as a result of the pandemic. Sameer Dhore, a student at the University of Greenwich and president of the university’s Indian Society, says: “Students are crying on the phone saying they want to see their mum or dad. The major issue is finance. Students are running out of money right now. There are students with nothing to live on.”The National Indian Students and Alumni Union says it has received thousands of queries from anxious students “trapped” across the UK, hundreds of whom say they do not have enough to eat.Sanam Arora, NISAU’s chairwoman, says: “A lot of students rely on part-time jobs, and now they have lost them they can’t pay their rent or buy food.” She says there is an atmosphere of panic: “The mental health issues are just flabbergasting. Some students have even threatened suicide.”The organisation has called on the Indian government to help get students home, and is backing a call by the UK’s National Union of Students for the UK government to do more to help. “International students are falling through the safety net,” she warns.Prerit Souda, an INSA committee member, says that as well as being unable to buy food, some students have been facing eviction because they cannot pay their rent. “We connect them with legal experts, but in some scenarios students have been sub-contracting and that is much more difficult as they don’t have the same rights. In those cases we have been working with Indian community organisations to find them somewhere free to stay.”The Indian government has said the flights ban will continue until midnight on Sunday. Student groups, charities and parents are calling for students to be put to the front of the queue for repatriation.Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, says all universities now have support systems in place. Vivienne Stern, UUK’s international director, says: “The first piece of advice we would give students is please, please contact your university. If they don’t know, they can’t help you. They might not be able to fix everything, but there are people on hand who want to help and listen to your problems.”Stern says some universities are going the extra mile to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to come to them. These include Exeter University, which has been calling all remaining international students daily. Meanwhile, Bath University has moved students who were in halls in the city centre into rooms on its campus, and is providing three free meals a day.Meanwhile, parents and relatives back in India have been using social media to beg the Indian government to bring their children home. They include Dipti Taluja, whose 18-year-old son is doing a degree in sound engineering and music production at a private higher education institution in London. “It is very scary sitting thousands of miles away and knowing you are helpless and cannot do anything to bring back your child,” she says from her home in Gurugram, near New Delhi. Her son has been “very depressed”, she says, but is coping better after speaking to volunteers at NISAU.The UK Council for International Student Affairs has an advice page to help students."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bd9067d41a9b21f0a883959b4e2a657ffb4d508/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=85d1ded54a75642a31fd2a23e1296aba 1760w","title":"best way to support hair salon during lockdown","story":"There are ways you can help your hairdresser – and love your locksThere are some 42,000 hair salons in the UK and at the time of writing, every one is closed. I miss them dreadfully – the roar of competing dryers, the fug of lacquer, the happy chatter between trusted stylist and loyal client – but nothing like as much as salons miss their livelihoods. These are dark times for all, of course, but particularly for the service industry.Hairdressers generally earn a basic wage, plus a percentage of their appointments and tips. Without customers, all will struggle. But there are ways we can help them, now. If you’re fortunate enough to still be earning a full salary, consider pre-paying for your next appointment or three with gift vouchers bought online. This keeps cash flowing during lockdown, helping staff to get paid.Another way to have their backs is by replenishing your hair products not through Amazon or supermarkets, but by buying from your hairdresser’s website where possible.L’Oréal Professionnel, whose Tecni Art Pli spray (£16.10, 190ml) is probably the most-used hair styling product in photoshoot history, is available widely online via a network of salons. Use it to add grip to slippy hair, volume to flat roots and hold to thick locks. It’s truly fantastic.Even when your finances are looking shaky, it’s possible to help by following your favourite salon on Instagram and Facebook, and interacting with its posts. A busy, helpful social media presence will keep the business relevant and awareness constant during lockdown, and may attract new clients for when it’s all over.

Movie theatres across the globe, from China to the US, have shut down during the coronavirus pandemic, and arguments have broken out, as much on ideological lines as economic, as to how and when to reopen. In Sweden, however, some have remained open all along, operating under new government guidelines. With 47 cinemas and about 200 screens, the country’s second-largest chain Svenska Bio stayed operational – and as a result has become Europe’s biggest operator by box office revenue.Fornstam has been both lauded and reviled for keeping his cinemas open – even more since the biggest cinema chain in Sweden, Filmstaden, closed theirs. The 65-year-old takes a long view. “Swedes … there used to be a joke that if every Swede were told to have a blue and a yellow sock, nobody would question the decision but they would question if the colour of the sock could cause cancer,” he says. “The government said we should do this. So we’ll do this. We can stick to the rules. Also, there are physical and mental issues to deal with, so we try to keep everyone going.”Forstam’s position is in keeping with Sweden’s more liberal response to the pandemic. While its neighbours Denmark, Finland and Norway went into various versions of lockdown, Sweden closed high schools and universities but allowed kindergartens and primaries to remain open. Theatres, museums and sporting arenas were closed, restaurants remained open. The government said that if social distancing rules are not followed, offending businesses would be shut down. The country has faced heavy criticism from scientists as it recorded a far higher death rate than its neighbours, with Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, saying that “there is a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies”.However, the Swedish model has been hailed by conservatives in the US – without understanding, according Lars Trägårdh, a history professor at Ersta Sköndal Bräcke University College, that it depends on the population’s compliance with, and trust in, the state. “It is interesting to see that the Swedish stress on what we call ‘freedom under responsibility’ is getting picked up by the libertarian right in the US. The big problem with all of that is that Sweden is all built, ultimately, on a very strong alliance between the state and the inidual.” Swedes, in effect, follow the recommendations of authorities. Swedish-American journalist Erik Augustin Palm went even further in an article in Slate, citing Sweden’s peculiar cultural attributes such as “unbounded trust in state experts and an internalised sense of exceptionalism” as contributing factors to the belief that the government knows what it’s doing. “It is still possible that Sweden’s Covid-19 response could be exonerated – say, herd immunity does take effect and Sweden’s death rate is lower than neighbouring countries’ at some point … This seems highly unlikely, but still possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ed3c5c28c88a655c10ab57e2962b0e1ddf2649a/0_0_2901_1740/master/2901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93e2f2b52ff2765c4c4ff8b165c63298","title":"tracee ellis ross black ish as a kid singing was too scary a dream","story":"She’s acted, modelled, worked with Kanye West and Drake. But the Black-ish star didn’t dare follow her mother, Diana Ross – until nowThere is a strange noise coming from Tracee Ellis Ross’s Los Angeles garden. Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. “I’m just going to go check that out. Stand by!”If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn’t a horror movie, it’s a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom Black-ish, is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was right now, I’m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch.In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at 47, Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her 20s, but started getting serious attention only in her early 40s, with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow “Bow” Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a cultural phenomenon. Barack and Michelle Obama are fans Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not.A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we’re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. “I think we’re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It’s like the fear is just waiting right there.” She gestures towards the window.The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross’s hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she’s wearing a floral, Georgia O’Keeffe-esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through – a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once put it, Ross “can do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a 10”.But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is Diana Ross, and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with Andy Warhol when she was 11, and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat?“I’ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,” Ross says. “My mom always joked: ‘I’m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I’ll make sure there’s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that…’ I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, ‘If you want to keep buying those clothes, you’re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.’ There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.”Ross speaks fondly of her family, to whom she is extremely close. Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross’s children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross’s second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome.“My mom always put us in bed, then she’d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She’d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.” Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. “I nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn’t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.”But being her mother’s daughter didn’t necessarily help when it came to work. “When I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,” Ross says. “It might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: ‘OK, is she as good as her mom?’”She got her first big break as a comic on MTV’s The Lyricist Lounge Show in 2000. The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom Girlfriends, which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a “black show”.“The landscape of television was not the same as it is now,” Ross says. “It was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early 2000s were not that time.” Despite the size of Girlfriends’ audience, she didn’t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. “It wasn’t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,” she says. “It was a matter of which eyeballs were watching.”Then, in 2014, Black-ish came along and “everything started to happen”. In 2017 she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since 1983 (when Debbie Allen won for Fame). Her proud family had already taken out a full-page ad in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination.Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre “Dre” Johnson, that isn’t always evident in sitcoms. “Often the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,” she says. “I’ve never enjoyed that.“There’s a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,” she continues. “While the story is told through the eyes of the man, I’m not just the wife. I’m not just a doctor. I’m not just a mom. I’m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre’s – it’s based in my experience and my life.”Sometimes, Ross says, Bow’s autonomy was “naturally written into the script” and sometimes she pushed for it. “I’m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,” she explains. “In a scene, if they have written that I’m doing ‘lady-chores’ such as the cooking, I’m like: why? It’s not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I’ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.”She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice™ enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create Mixed-ish, a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow’s heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow’s childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in 80s America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show’s politics too simplistic, and it’s not clear whether it will be back for a second season.Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career. She has modelled, given a TED talk (on the power of women’s fury) and signed up as an ambassador for Time’s Up. She has appeared in music videos for Drake and Kanye West, a former neighbour. She runs her own company, Pattern, a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. “I have wanted to sing since I was a kid,” she tells me. “But it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.” There was, after all, a lot to live up to.A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie. Directed by Nisha Ganatra (who worked on Amazon’s Transparent), The High Note sees Ross play a superstar singer, Grace Davis, whose career has peaked. Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by Dakota Johnson) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she’s not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when.A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. “This is a very small disappointment.” But still, it stings. “At 47 years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work… it was life-changing for me.” Did she really wait until 47 to start? “Pretty much. In high school, I took choir – it was one of the required courses – and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster’s office: ‘Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it’s fair to force somebody who doesn’t want to sing and who doesn’t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.’ And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.”Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add “a flare of comedy or hide behind a character”. So it wasn’t until very recently that she decided “to face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn’t do it small – I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical a.”A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey. Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. “I had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,” she says. She wasn’t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded Ross has a beautiful voice.On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don’t even know how inappropriate they’re being when they ask why she’s not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn’t “mind any more. It no longer stings. It’s just an opportunity for me to expand somebody’s idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate. Everything in my being and my career is about encouraging women to give themselves permission to take up the space. I am very comfortable making people uncomfortable. Not just for my own wellbeing, but hopefully so that other women don’t have to bear that weight quite as heavily as my generation.”She remains “happily and gloriously single”, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t men in the background. When I ask whether she’s had texts from exes during lockdown – something of a pandemic phenomenon – she grins. “Oh, that’s definitely come up,” she says coyly, but won’t go into detail. “I have a heart that is very open and available to find the right man,” she continues. “But, you know, the old expression ‘sweep me off my feet’ seems ridiculous. I want to find a man who will meet me where I am. Because, actually, I like my feet. I like them grounded on the floor.”Our conversation is interrupted by the ping of a text message from a special man in her life. It’s her dad, wishing her a happy Passover. Ross has been doing regular group calls with her family since lockdown began. “FaceTime with my dad is like this,” she says with a laugh, manoeuvring the computer under her armpit. “I’m like: ‘I can’t see you!’ And he’s like: ‘I can see you!’ And I’m like: ‘I know, I can’t see you!’”What does she miss most about normal life? “I really miss smelling the people that I love,” Ross says. “Being able to nestle my head in my mom’s neck, or in my best friend’s. When I hug my best friend, it’s a full body hug. And I know what her scent is – not just her perfume, but just what she smells like. I don’t think I realised how important that is.”The hardest moments of lockdown, Ross says, seem to be between 10.30pm and 1am. It’s then that the “collective trauma and bizarre nature” of what we’re going through really hits her. “I just want something to distract me and it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s just me. Oh hi again! Hey you!’”There has been some solace, she says, in the fiddle-leaf fig she’s sitting next to. “I’ve been doing a lot of talking to her. She was a little upset to begin with because I forgot to water her for the first few weeks – a lot of leaves started to fall off.

Is white sliced the way to go? Are you funny about runny yolks? Does it need bacon or cheese? Is hot sauce outrageous?The thing that Gael Greene remembers most vividly about the night she had sex with Elvis Presley is the sandwich he asked her to order from room service afterwards. The fabled New York food writer does not remember some of the more salacious details of the evening, but Greene’s memoir, Insatiable, records with absolute clarity Presley’s demand for a post-coital fried egg sandwich.How to Eat – this series exploring how best to enjoy Britain’s favourite foods – can only respect such prioritisation. For what is one night of passion with the most desirable man on earth compared with the knowledge of the timeless sensual pleasures of the fried egg sandwich? Beautiful people are often selfish, whereas our subject this month, the fried egg sandwich, will cater to your animal instincts in an entirely selfless, generous, non-judgmental way. No shame. No awkwardness. You don’t even have to put your best knickers on.Writing in the NME, Paul Morley once described Coronation Street’s loafer-in-chief, Stan Ogden, as “a man who could see the whole world in a fried egg sandwich”. HTE chooses to read this Blakeian riff as a compliment. In his Zen-like way, Stan could absorb himself in this simple act as the totality of human experience. In the ultimate democratic treat – inexpensive, accessible, easy to cook – Stan discovered his meaning.We have all been there, eating a fried egg butty, the pleasure familiar but always fresh, thinking: “This is the pinnacle of existence life will not get better.” But this is only true if that fried egg sandwich has been made correctly, which is where HTE must intervene.There are lot of very bad things happening to the fried egg sandwich, mostly in the US. Using a circular container such as an English muffin (think of the potential overhang) or worse a bagel (gaping hole + runny yolk  tragicomic disaster) is baffling. Americans also seem to find it impossible to make a sandwich without toasting the bread or pan-frying the whole thing like a grilled cheese sandwich. Why?Inflexible andor dry toasted bread is nonsensical here. There is no need to create a textural contrast between crisp toast and soft egg. On the contrary, the comfort-food essence of a fried egg sandwich – nursery food for the never-nannied classes – lies in how it yields so easily as you bite into it. It should offer a lack of resistance in subtly differentiated layers so easy to penetrate you could gum your way through it without your teeth in. Generic white sliced bread – floppy, plasticised, woolly and unreal – is the way to go. And “none of that brown stuff”, as Peter Stringfellow rightly insists.Opting for white sliced bread is not solely about texture and flavour (the bread acting as a bland delivery vehicle for its rich dairy partner*), but also feel and practicality. With a little pressure from the palm of your hand, thin slices of squishy bread will mould around the hot, slippery egg to form a malleable, manageable, partially sealed pocket, in which everything is securely contained. Such bread allows you to relax. Everything in that sandwich is under control.*On the rich dairy front, a fried egg sandwich should be buttered as surely as bears enjoy secluded, woodland toilet spots. If you cannot see teeth marks in the butter, if melted butter is not spotting your plate in the style of Jackson Pollock, you are doing it wrong.The greatest schism in the fried egg community is between the chosen few who flip the egg and fry the yolk until it is verging on solid (over-medium approaching over-hard in US diner lingo) and those heretics and heathens who leave the yolk runny.Instead, you need that yolk barely set, still fudgy, residually runny at its very centre, but only to the extent that any leakage can be quickly gobbled down or absorbed by the surrounding bread. That state is a matter of seconds cooking on the flip.Food writing is full of nauseatingly twee or pompous hymns to the velvety richness of egg yolks. By dint of its relative scarcity, the yolk is considered luxurious while the white is disregarded as workaday. HTE loves both, but, if forced to choose, the creamy white definitely edges it. On days when the yolk can seem cloying, there is still something irresistible about that sweet albumen, its tensile resistance between the teeth and the way its subtle flavour forms a holy trinity with bread and butter.Perhaps it is down to how your palate was formed. If from an early age your life was filled with gilt-edged gastronomic adventure, you may feel a pampered fealty to the yolk. If you are used to a plainer, cheaper diet, the white already tastes like a heaven-sent treat. HTE is not saying that a preference for yolk or white is the ultimate class ide. But nor is it saying that it isn’t.As the soft, curvaceous smoothness of that white is precious, please do not ruin it by radically overcooking your egg. Fried eggs with crispy, browned frills, their edges like hardened melted plastic, are terrible. Better an undercooked white than burnt edges.There is a self-serving narrative implicit in food journalism (there are pages to fill, magazines to sell … or at least there used to be), that food is in a constant process of refinement and improvement, in pursuit of a forever-delayed perfection. We can never accept what we have, much less suggest subtracting ingredients from dishes. Simplicity does not sell. Every food must, by endless add-ons and ever-greater complexity, be elevated to its “next-level”, “deluxe” or “ultimate” manifestation.Consequently, people are always adding ingredients to the fried egg sandwich (blue cheese, avocado, bacon jam, kimchi, bechamel, anchovy paste, rocket, ham, possibly all at the same time), which ruins the whole concept. What if, and HTE is just throwing this out there, the “best ever” fried egg sandwich was ... a fried egg sandwich? One made with the best egg you can buy, enjoyed without distraction?Add some cheap, crispy bacon if you must (as a textural fillip, as seasoning), but why waste great bacon here? Savour it on its own. Similarly, a fried egg sandwich does not require additional sliced cheddar, which, as those slices soften but fail to melt, will morph into a gummy unsatisfying paste. Note: the inclusion of any salad items, such as sliced tomato, is symptomatic of a self-loathing that requires psychiatric intervention.A condiment is acceptable. If judiciously applied, tomato sauce is the most obvious contender, its sharp vinegary twang a counterpoint to the dairy. HTE considers brown sauce a terrible creation, but, in this case, it is less egregious than mayonnaise (appalling flavour profile on hot sandwiches), mustard (only acceptable if you smoke 40 a day) or hot sauce, the use of which on all foods, no matter how unsuitable, is now a kind of mass hysteria.From drunken, ravenous 4am feasts (remember them?) to moments of 4pm ennui, the fried egg sandwich fits. Breakfast, lunch, dinner or tea, it works. Ready in seconds and requiring only a pan and a plate (c’mon, keep it civilised), it is entry-level heaven.Tea or coffee: don’t even think about anything else.So, fried egg sandwiches, how do you eat yours?

Its list of needs: special ‘00’ flour, damp cloths, a certain temperature to prove and a double knead seemed greater to me than those of a newborn baby.But then, one day, I threw off my pizza-schedule shackles, used plain flour instead, didn’t prove or knock back the dough and instead whacked it straight in the oven, and a joyous, thin, crisp and chewy pizza emerged 20 minutes later. A coup for hungry mouths and impatient cooks alike.In this recipe, I’ve covered the base with a store-cupboard romesco sauce and some leeks, but really it’s just a starting point for any topping adventure.For the dough400g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2½ tbsp olive oil2 tsp caster sugar1 tsp salt7g dried active yeastFor the romesco75ml light olive oil3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed25g dried breadcrumbs½ tsp salt2 tsp sweet paprika50g sundried tomatoes (ie, about 6), drained and roughly chopped100g toasted flaked almonds375g jarred roasted red peppers, drained and roughly choppedFor the topping2 small leeks (200g), cut on an angle into ½cm slices2 tbsp olive oilHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Combine the flour, oil, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl, add 200ml warm water, then mix with your hands and knead in the bowl until you have a smooth dough. Cover with a tea towel and put to one side for a moment.Next, make the romesco sauce. Warm the oil and half the crushed garlic in a frying pan over a medium heat and after a minute or two, as soon as the garlic begins to turn golden, add the breadcrumbs, half a teaspoon of salt and the paprika. Fry, stirring, for a minute or so, until the breadcrumbs turn a rich, golden colour, then add the sundried tomato pieces, almonds, peppers and the remaining garlic, and stir until everything is just warmed through.Leave to cool, then scrape into a food processor, blitz smooth (if need be, add a couple of tablespoons of water to get to a good saucy consistency) and transfer to a bowl.Lightly dust two large baking trays with flour. Divide the dough into four even pieces (about 160g each), roll or press each one into 20cm rounds, then put two on each tray and spread two or three tablespoons of romesco over each pizzette, leaving a small rim at the edge. Put the leeks in a bowl, toss with the olive oil, then pile over the top of the pizzette (it will look like a lot, but it’ll reduce when cooked). Bake in the hot oven for 15-20 minutes, until the dough is puffed up and golden and the leeks are crisp, and serve with a cold glass of white wine, preferably Spanish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13c9a5aef7f98061b8c12a3492a50bd79d301e83/0_26_3501_2101/master/3501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17e428927c0b4382c6a5c1c2200a929a","title":"sarina wiegman england women future oranje netherlands","story":"The 100-cap midfielder has transformed the women’s game in the Netherlands as a manager and represents a template for female coach development in England“Nexit” – Phil Neville’s departure from the role of England Women’s coach – has been confirmed for next year and the hunt to find a successor is under way at a time when coronavirus has left the domestic game facing financial stress. In the wake of Nexit, the need to appoint a national manager capable of reassuring – and inspiring – supporters, sponsors and investors has assumed unprecedented urgency the Football Association knows this is a decision that it literally cannot afford to get wrong.Early frontrunners include Jill Ellis – the Portsmouth-born coach who took the USA to victory in last year’s World Cup – Chelsea’s talented Emma Hayes, her promising Manchester United counterpart, Casey Stoney, and Laura Harvey, now in a development role with the USA after an impressive stint as Arsenal manager.There are other credible contenders but one outstanding candidate has received puzzlingly few mentions. Step forward Sarina Wiegman and a solution to Nexit potentially as dazzling as the sea of orange that greeted the Netherlands’ Euro 2017 triumph.In leading the Oranje to European Championship success on home soil and then the final of last summer’s World Cup in France, Wiegman has transformed the topography of the women’s game in the Netherlands beyond recognition. Perhaps more important, the 50-year-old’s career evolution – including a formative stint working in the men’s game – represents a template for female coach development in England.Wiegman’s contract with the Dutch FA ends in 2021 and she has seemed receptive to a new challenge. Admittedly, with two teenage daughters and a husband coaching in men’s football, the timing and logistics could be wrong but surely the FA should be making an approach to a female coach who ticks multiple boxes.Wiegman would arrive not only fluent in English but with fresh eyes and a healthy emotional detachment from a Lionesses squad that has fallen at the semi-final stage in the last three major tournaments.If scouting trips to watch the raft of Netherlands players plying their trade in the WSL will have offered her sufficient insight to hit the ground running, so too should Wiegman’s tactical flexibility and streak of stylistic pragmatism.Neville, set to remain in situ until next summer, was derailed by his failure to compromise his possession-heavy vision, based on building from the back. Wiegman’s subtle refinement of the Netherlands’ counterattacks and transitions between attack and defence shows greater adaptability.Granted England need to retain the ball better but their progress under Mark Sampson was based on a hybrid, flexible and counterattacking style that kept opponents guessing and camouflaged inidual flaws. They do not need another coach stubbornly in thrall to Neville’s principles, which failed to maximise the Lionesses’ strengths.Wiegman has been making the best of things in an imperfect context since. As a six-year-old, she demanded her hair be cut short in order to defy a ban on mixed football and join her twin brother in a boys’ team in The Hague. In 2001 she became the first female Dutch international to earn 100 caps, while 2016 marked her pro licence coaching qualification, then held by only two other women in the Netherlands.Wiegman went on to spend a season playing in North Carolina under Anson Dorrance, who had coached the USA to victory in the 1991 World Cup. “I always thought I was different from other girls,” she says. “People said: ‘You’re too fanatical about football.’ When I went to Carolina I was normal it was paradise.”She returned home on a mission to transplant American passion and nous for women’s football into her Dutch compatriots. “We needed proper facilities, good programmes and good coaches,” she says. “After 20 years we got that system.”In the interim she worked as a PE teacher, becoming a full-time women’s coach at Den Haag in 2007. By the time the pro licence was secured Wiegman was on the national coaching staff and an innovative fast-track that involved the culture shock of a year’s internship at Sparta Rotterdam, deployed as an assistant men’s first-team coach.If teaching had honed Wiegman’s communication skills and organisational abilities, she gained a streetwise edge and increased emotional intelligence. “It was a new environment and I had to figure things out,” she says. “But it improved me, gave me confidence and taught me about different behaviours.”Sparta Rotterdam offered her the right framework in which to properly develop a talent swiftly reapplied when she became national women’s manager. If the FA could do worse than encourage emerging English female coaches to follow a similar Oranje-tinted route map and take routine internships in men’s football, poaching Wiegman also would make eminent sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7f8924aec98a3a0196e14fa149ccb6f831a80ef/54_377_2374_1423/master/2374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ebf5f7c32f225f85ba033dc60f6233d","title":"blackpool v bolton wanderers 1953 fa cup final live","story":"38 min: Lofthouse goes on another tear down the inside-left channel, chasing after a dismal Garrett backwards header, but drifts too far wide and slices his shot-cum-cross out of play. But this has been a good response to conceding by the ten-and-a-bit men.37 min: Lofthouse reminds Blackpool that their 11 fit men and true won’t have it all their own way. A long pass down the left flank. He spins Shimwell and tears off after it. He’s free on goal! He strides into the area and lashes a left-foot shot ... wide left. He should have worked the uncertain Farm at the very least. Farm performs the internationally recognised palms-out mime for Calm Down, I’m In Charge. He wasn’t.36 min: Blackpool were beginning to grind Bolton down back there, and the dam eventually broke. It’ll be interesting to see how Bolton respond to that equaliser, effectively a man down, Bell little more than a passenger. They could do with hearing the half-time whistle. Get to the break level, and reorganise. Matthews, by contrast, fancies striking while the iron is hot. He shimmies in from the right and whips a low cross towards Mortensen. It clips the unfortunate Hassall, and Hanson does well to gather at his near post, to avoid any more embarrassment for the makeshift defender.From the resulting goal kick, Johnston returns the ball upfield with feeling. It breaks to Mortensen, who turns and powers down the inside-left channel. He sashays past Barrass and Ball, enters the box, and threads a diagonal shot across Hanson and towards the bottom right. It’s going in ... but Hassall, running back at full pelt to cover, deflects the shot into the bottom left, firing it past his wrong-footed keeper! On the BBC, Wolstenholme claims “Hassall! Hassall has scored!” which not only sounds all wrong, but is all wrong. The initial shot was definitely heading into the right-hand corner, so it’s Mortensen’s goal. Hassall won’t want to be credited with it anyway. Whatever, it’s the first one Bolton have ever conceded in an FA Cup final at Wembley, having won their Twenties triptych 2-0, 1-0 and 2-0.34 min: Blackpool’s best chance of the match! Perry launches an attack with a cute lob and spin over Barrass. Banks gets in the way, but Blackpool quickly come again at Bolton, Taylor in space out on the left. He rolls a precise diagonal pass inside for Perry, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. It’s a great opportunity, but he drags it wide right, Hanson not required to warm his hands. But that’s given the Blackpool fans hope, and they respond with a surge of noise.33 min: Bolton string a few passes together, Lofthouse, Hassall, Langton and Wheeler all involved in an eye-catching right-to-left sweeping move. But the final pass finds Bell out on the left, and it’s all he can do to weakly prod the ball towards the first man Fenton. Blackpool clear.32 min: Mudie rides a roughhouse challenge from behind by Wheeler and bursts into space in the Bolton half. He prods the ball forward for Mortensen, who immediately sweeps it towards Matthews on the right. Matthews crosses high. Hanson punches with great uncertainty, the ball falling to Taylor, 12 yards out. It’s a fine chance, but Taylor scoops it wide right. Hanson got away with one there. Blackpool are beginning to ask a few questions, though.31 min: Matthews affects to run back up the right flank, but checks and plays a cute reverse pass down the channel for Mortensen, who slides it further forward to Taylor, just inside the box. Taylor shoots, but falls back and his effort is blocked. The ball breaks to Mortensen, who tries to bend one into the bottom right. Not a bad effort, but it sails wide.30 min: Now Langton is down, having hurt himself while trying to strip the ball from the ever-dangerous Taylor. Bolton trainer and geopolitical analyst Sproston comes on again with his magic linen. This time the towel does work, and the Bolton outside-left springs up, ready to go into battle again. Bolton can ill afford another injury they’d effectively be playing with nine men.29 min: Taylor skitters in from the right and beats three men, before rolling a pass down the inside-right channel for Matthews. For once the great man is on the back foot, and can’t quite get to the ball. It’s cleared upfield. The ball bounces right next to Bell, and in normal circumstances he’d take up possession without thinking twice. But the poor chap is in a dreadful state. Hamstrung, he lurches towards the ball like a drunk chasing his own hat. Four steps, each of them clearly terribly painful, and he’s never going to get to it. He gives up the futile chase. So sad to see on football’s big day. “I think we can write him off,” suggests Kenneth Wolstenholme on the BBC Television Service. Sadly, he’s probably right. He’ll stay out on the left wing as a nuisance, nothing more, but it’s very difficult to see him influencing this match in any meaningful way.28 min: Perry drifts in from the left with a view to influencing proceedings. He clips a pass down the middle for Taylor, but Hassall, who has been superb so far both in attack and defence, reads the danger and nips in to intercept.26 min: Matthews loops one in from the right but it’s easily punched clear by Hanson, who really hasn’t had all that much to do this afternoon.25 min: Blackpool haven’t tested Bolton too much. Perry tries to break into their box down the left, but he’s denied by a wonderfully timed tackle by Ball. Anything other than perfection, and that would have been a penalty kick.24 min: When play eventually restarts, Hassall drives down the middle in the hope of making space for a shot, but is ushered wide left by Shimwell. Hassall is forced to turn tail, but then spins and crosses deep. That should be meat and drink for Lofthouse, but for once he’s a little behind play, and Garrett is able to head clear.23 min: Lofthouse and Johnston continue their increasingly intriguing duel, chasing after a long pass down the Bolton right. Lofthouse can’t keep the ball in play that’ll be a throw. But he’s running at full pelt, straight for the corner flag. Whipping it free from his moorings to avoid injury, he breaks it. A brief break in play as the referee orders the linesman to swap it with the centre flag. Tum-te-tum. Maybe the BBC should run their film of potter’s wheel.22 min: Matthews is checked by Banks as he whistles down the right. A few boos greet the cynicism. Shimwell wastes the resulting free kick, lashing it carelessly wide right from 25 yards.21 min: Incidentally, a quick word on Bolton trainer Bert Sproston, formerly a full-back with Leeds United and England. While on an end-of-season tour of Europe with England in 1938, Sproston and Stanley Matthews were passing time in a Berlin coffee shop when a motorcade carrying the Fuhrer whizzed by. “I’ve not had much of an education, and I know nowt about politics and the like,” Sproston told Matthews. “All I know is football. But the way I see it, that Hitler fellow is an evil little twat.” Sproston and Matthews were both in the team that thrashed Germany 6-3 the next day. 20 min: Really not sure how that stayed out. Langton takes the resulting corner, which leads to Wheeler playing a spot of solo head tennis on the edge of the box, before looping the ball softly into the arms of Farm. In fact, the flag goes up for offside, and of all people it’s Bell. He’s back on, and he’s going to hobble around at outside left, having wrapped his left thigh with some elasticated bandage. Looks like Hassall will drop back to cover the Bell-shaped gap at left-half.19 min again: BOLTON HIT THE POST! The ten men nearly go two up, immediately after the restart! Lofthouse heads a speculative long ball down for Moir, who slips a first-time return down the middle to release the player of the year on goal! Farm rushes off his line. Lofthouse pokes the ball past him towards the bottom left ... but off the base of the post and away! The ball breaks to Langton on the left, who lashes goalwards. Farm and Fenton somehow combine to scramble it around the post with Moir lurking for the tap-in!19 min: The towels don’t work. Bell immediately limps off, having pulled his hamstring. Echoes of last year, when Arsenal were forced down to ten men after Walley Barnes twisted his knee ligaments in the thick Wembley grass. Arsenal eventually lost to Newcastle Bolton will be hoping the pattern doesn’t repeat this afternoon. 18 min: This won’t help matters, though. Bolton left-half Bell has pulled up and appears to be in some distress. He shakes his head sadly as Bolton trainer Bert Sproston trots on carrying his full medical kit: a voluminous white towel.16 min: Lofthouse is caught miles offside. It’s all gone a bit scrappy. Not a classic this, so far. Plenty of time.14 min: Mudie drives down the middle and flicks a pass towards Mortensen on his right. Mortensen should return a simple pass that would ping Mudie free, but it’s off target and Bolton are able to clear their lines. Blackpool come again through that man Matthews, but he’s held up well down the right by Barrass. Banks them comes sliding in recklessly had he made any sort contact with Matthews the winger would have gone flying and it would have been a clear penalty. But instead he sort of flops on the ball, and refuses to move, while Matthews tries to extricate it with a few prods of the big toe. Some laughter in the crowd at these slapstick shenanigans. A drop ball, which is cleared away from danger by Bolton.13 min: The final ball’s lacking at the moment. Perry enjoys a bit of space down the Blackpool left, but can’t find anyone in the middle. Then Hassall looks to have got the better of Shimwell down the Bolton left, but the pair slip over on the lush hallowed turf, and that’s that.11 min: Blackpool are beginning to settle now. Mortensen sweeps a first-time pass wide right for Matthews, who again eviscerates Banks. A one-two with Taylor nearly releases Matthews into the area, but Wheeler is across quickly to blooter out for another corner. And the set-piece is another non-event. Blackpool come back at Bolton through Perry down the left, but the outside-left’s ambitious attempt to curl one into the top right flies high and wide. Another time, maybe.10 min: Matthews turns on the jets and zips past Banks, making it all look so very, very easy. He whips a vicious cross towards the near post, where Mortensen es to head but is beaten to the ball by Barrass. Corner. Matthews takes, and it’s another poor one, again cleared by Hassall, who launches a break up the left with Langton. Nothing comes of it.9 min: But Blackpool don’t have the monopoly on unnecessary errors. Bolton’s captain Moir, under no pressure whatsoever, shanks comically in the centre circle, sending the ball looping towards Matthews, who passes inside for Taylor. The inside right, who won the cup for Newcastle two years ago while playing against Blackpool, slides a ball down the middle for Perry, just inside the box. Perry, the first African player to star in a cup final, can’t quite get a shot away and Banks clears.8 min: Blackpool are making silly mistakes. Now it’s Garrett’s turn to smack a clearance straight at a Bolton player. Attempting to hook up the left flank, he succeeds only in hitting Holden, who skitters down the wing, into the box, and pulls back for Lofthouse, just inside the area. Lofthouse doesn’t have much time and space with which to work, and the ball’s caught a little under his feet, so his quickly manufactured shovel towards the top right sails harmlessly wide.7 min: Langton takes the corner from the left. Hassall flicks dangerously on at the near post, but Johnston has read the danger well and heads powerfully upfield. Barrass returns it in the hope of finding Holden out on the right, but the ball bounces harmlessly out for a goal kick. Bolton are looking much the more dangerous side during these early stages.6 min: Barrass hoicks forward for Bolton towards nobody in particular. Johnston should deal with it easily, but attempts a first-time pass straight back upfield and clanks the ball into Lofthouse, who takes the opportunity to turn the Blackpool defender this way and that down the right flank. Johnston toe-pokes out for a throw, from which Robinson clatters into the back of Holden by the right-hand corner of the penalty box. Free kick in a very dangerous position. Bolton load the box at the far post. Wheeler takes, and it’s a pretty dismal effort, floating straight at Farm. But the Blackpool keeper Farm is a bag of nerves after that early error, and he tips a ball that was sailing over the bar out for a needless corner.5 min: Blackpool captain Johnston quarterbacks from deep. He strokes a fine long pass wide right for Matthews, who cuts inside, those ageing toes twinkling as brightly as ever. The ball’s worked out left to Perry, who thinks he’s won a corner off the Bolton left-back Banks, but it’s just a throw. The ball’s flung into the mixer without much thought. Blackpool don’t look flustered exactly, but their heads may not yet have quite cleared in the wake of that early goal. Their passes aren’t sticking in the final third.4 min: Holden and Lofthouse combine neatly and nearly break clear down the inside-right channel. But Garrett stands firm and, with a little help from a couple of team-mates, hustles the ball clear. Early signs that Bolton are going to concentrate their efforts down their right flank, no surprise given Blackpool left-back Garrett has a broken nose and the left-half Robinson is a late stand-in for Hughie Kelly.3 min: So Blackpool have another opportunity to showcase their direct kick-off routine in double-quick time. Mortensen and Taylor make off down the middle again, and the ball breaks to the right for Matthews. He can’t get a cross away, but his right-back, Shimwell, is able to hoick one in from deep. The Bolton keeper Hanson deals with the high ball well enough, crowded as he is on his goalline, and slaps clear. Hassall completes the job with a second-phase hoof upfield. This is a mighty brisk start.... the ball is worked to Holden out on the right. Holden drops a shoulder and sits down the Blackpool left-back Garrett in a style Matthews himself will surely have admired. Holden sends the ball across the face of the box. Moir swipes and misses. Hassall, on the left-hand edge of the D, takes up possession instead and thinks about shooting. But with plenty of tangerine up in his grille, he rolls the ball back across the face of the box for Holden, who tees up Lofthouse for a speculative shot. Lofthouse smears a first-time diagonal effort towards the bottom left. Farm should parry, but the ball bounces just before it reaches his hands, hops gently over them, and in! That was a fine sweeping move by Bolton, but it should never have resulted in a goal. A miserable mistake by Farm, and Bolton lead after 75 seconds. Lofthouse has now scored in every round of the cup this season!1 min: Matthews takes the corner himself but it’s a poor one and headed clear by Hassall. Bolton stream up the other end, and ... And we’re off! Mortensen gets the ball rolling, flicking to Taylor, who embarks on an immediate no-nonsense dribble down the middle. Attacking intent displayed from the get-go. Taylor is crowded out, but Hassall dawdles in the centre circle and suddenly Mortensen is making good down the inside-right channel. He rolls further wide to Matthews, whose first touch is met with a surge of excitement from the 100,000-strong Wembley crowd. He crosses, forcing Bell to head behind for the first corner of the game after a mere 22 seconds!The teams are out! Our new Queen, Elizabeth II, looks on from the royal box. God bless you ma’am, you do a lovely job. It’s the first time a reigning Queen has rocked up for the big game. Down on the pitch, hubby Prince Philip is introduced to the players. Noticing that Bolton are wearing white satin shirts (bespoke tailored in Macclesfield) for their special day, he quips: “You look like a lot of chorus girls. Pansies!” O-ho! O-ho! Keep an eye on this one, Britain! We’ve got ourselves a new Max Miller here! Blackpool are in their trademark tangerine.Congratulations to Arsenal, incidentally. The Gunners won the Football League First Division last night in dramatic circumstances, coming from behind to beat Burnley 3-2, a result that meant they pipped Tom Finney’s Preston North End on goal average ... by 0.099 of a goal. A thin line between success and misery. After the celebrations, Arsenal’s regal defender Joe Mercer stood on the steps of Highbury to announce his retirement. Out at the very top, with trademark exquisite timing. Don’t change your mind, Joe, no good can come of it. But what an end to the title race! If we’re served up anything half as exciting today, we’ll be doing very well indeed. Like we said, lads, no pressure to deliver.Only the second half of the final will be broadcast live on the radio. The BBC had asked the FA for permission to cover the whole lot on the Light Programme, but were denied for some reason not totally clear. It’s all on the World Service, though. The entire game will also be broadcast on the BBC Television Service. A record audience is expected, as sales and rentals of television sets have sky-rocketed ahead of the Queen’s upcoming coronation in exactly one month’s time. Here’s hoping the lads put on a show. No pressure.Blackpool beat Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield Town, Southampton and Arsenal to get to the semi-finals. Bolton had a far easier route to the last four, seeing off Fulham, Notts County, Luton Town and Gateshead. The semis proved to be quite something.First up: Bolton v Everton at Maine Road. The goalfest began when Nat Lofthouse came flying out of the blocks: within minutes there were reports of a “stinging shot”, a “subtle flick”, and an “abrupt downward header” that “had the Everton defenders kicking anywhere and everywhere for safety”. Lofthouse scored twice in the first half from “dramatic breakaways”, adding to goals from Doug Holden and Willie Moir as Bolton romped into a 4-0 half-time lead. As if that wasn’t bad enough for Everton, their pain was compounded as striker Dave Hickson was forced to leave the pitch concussed for 15 minutes, and Tommy Clinton skewed a penalty wide just before the break.But the Second Division strugglers - Everton are at a low ebb right now - came roaring back at Bolton in the second period. John Willie Parker pulled one back immediately, and though Lofthouse then hit a post, Everton went on to unleash an “onslaught”: Peter Farrell slapped home a free kick and Parker added his second and Everton’s third. But luck wasn’t with the Merseysiders as they tried to reach Wembley for the first time in 20 years, and Bolton held on as “the game passed beyond the frontier of the normal into the realm of pure delirium”. Worth the few shillings admission, huh? Final score: Bolton Wanderers 4-3 Everton.Meanwhile at Villa Park, Blackpool and Tottenham were playing out a mini classic of their own. Stanley Matthews set up Bill Perry for the opening goal after seven minutes. Blackpool began to dominate, Matthews totally bossing Charlie Withers, but soon enough Spurs, champions of England just two years ago, began to get a grip. Their attacks “swept and flowed”, according to this very paper. “One glorious move went the length of the field with the ball on the ground and not a Blackpool player touching it.” Eddie Baily headed against the bar, then Len Duquemin equalised at the start of a second half that would be all Tottenham.But George Farm was inspired in the Blackpool goal, and the score remained 1-1 until the final minute ... at which point Spurs full back Alf Ramsey attempted to calmly poke a backpass into the hands of keeper Ted Ditchburn. The attempt ended in sad farce, Ramsey allowing the ball to clank off his thigh. Jackie Mudie nipped in to score an unanswerable winner. Ramsey walked off distraught. It was the sort of mistake that could destroy a man. That’ll weigh heavy on him for a long time. You wouldn’t be surprised if you never hear anything of him again. Final score: Blackpool 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur.Blackpool are without inside forward Allan ‘Bomber’ Brown, who broke his leg in the process of ramming home a late winner against Arsenal at Highbury in the quarter-finals. He misses out, just as he did in 1951 against Newcastle, the poor guy. Left-half Hughie Kelly chipped his ankle last week against Liverpool and also misses the big day. Jackie Mudie is Brown’s understudy, while Cyril Robinson replaces Kelly, making his FA Cup debut in the final. Left-back Tommy Garrett plays, despite breaking his nose last weekend he’s made of hard stuff, having worked down the mine as a teenager. He’ll wear some protection, but won’t fancy going up with Lofthouse, we’ll be bound. Blackpool really have been in the wars.Bolton, by contrast, are at full strength. Ten Lancastrians plus Aberdonian Willie Moir. Incidentally, Matthews isn’t the only veteran dreaming dreamy dreams today: Bolton keeper Stan Hanson will win his first prize at the ripe age of 37 should the Trotters triumph.Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves, there are 90 minutes of football to play after all, but in years to come, perhaps we’ll remember today’s match as the Joe Smith Final. Blackpool’s veteran boss is a big part of the story, you see. Back in the day, he used to bang them in for ... of course he did ... Bolton Wanderers. Relentlessly so: he’s their all-time leading scorer with 277 goals. As club captain, he lifted the FA Cup for the Trotters after the famous White Horse Final of 1923, and again three years later. Now having moved to the coast to manage Blackpool, he’s hoping to make it third time lucky with the Seasiders, having lost the finals of 1948 and 1951. If his team prevail this afternoon, against his old club, it’d surely be a story for the ages!Having said all that, quite a lot of attention is being focused on Blackpool winger Stanley Matthews. Quite. A. Lot. The biggest star English football has produced to date is, at the age of 38, running out of time to win the FA Cup medal that’s eluded him all these years. Blackpool twice let the lead slip against Manchester United in the 1948 final, they were undone by Newcastle cup specialist Jackie Milburn three years later, and many felt that was the old boy’s last chance of a medal. Unexpectedly, here comes another. He really is boozing in the last-chance saloon this time. Is the idol of English football destined to end his career with nothing tangible to show for all his talent? It’s unthinkable, but this is where we are.Problem for Matthews, Smith and Blackpool is, Bolton are currently three for three in FA Cup finals at Wembley. Admittedly all of these triumphs came in the 1920s - in addition to the aforementioned finals starring Smith, they also won in 1929 - but footballers can be a superstitious lot, and every little helps. They’ve also got a player of their own to rival the star power of Matthews: Nat Lofthouse, England’s Lion of Vienna. Lofthouse is the newly crowned Football Writers’ Player of the Year. And what a year! He scored 22 goals in the First Division, six in a challenge match between the Football League and the League of Ireland, and has found the net in every round of the cup so far. He’s knocking them in at a prodigious rate for both club and country. Who knows, he may one day threaten Joe Smith’s club record. Good luck stopping him today.But y’know, good luck stopping both of these attacks. Matthews and Lofthouse are flanked by a top-class supporting cast: Bolton forwards Willie Moir, Harold Hassall and Bobby Langton are all internationals, while Blackpool striker Stan Mortensen has been matching Lofthouse goal for goal in an England shirt. Throw in the results of the two league encounters this season - a 3-0 win for Blackpool and a 4-0 win for Bolton - and this has the promise to be a lot of fun. Can Blackpool win their first cup, and with it that precious medal for Matthews? Or will Bolton Wanderers lift the famous pot for the fourth time and break the old boy’s heart? We’ll find out soon enough. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290bb254069bfeb36fe35bc6c1646444c87caf59/0_309_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e4f9064b77a285e4faa72dce37b6903","title":"we needed to do more volunteers step up in lockdown lagos","story":"Groups of professionals are helping deliver essential packages in Nigeria’s largest cityTwelve friends fill hundreds of carefully arranged aid packages into four cars, then trail through Oniru’s empty streets, past sky-coloured luxury apartment blocks.In what is notionally an affluent suburb along Lagos’s coastline, the cars stop outside the shells of abandoned, part-constructed buildings, and the friends file into the informal housing compounds that sprawl within.They unload packages and tick off names from a growing spreadsheet of hundreds of families in need of food and other supplies.For years, the group of professionals in their 30s and 40s have delivered weekly or fortnightly packages to the poor in Orile, an underprivileged area of Nigeria’s largest city, and Oniru, where they live.But since a lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus, their task has become more urgent.“As soon as the lockdown hit we knew we needed to do more,” says Fifehan Osinkanlu, one of the friends. “You could see how desperate people are, it was really overwhelming and glaring.”The lockdown in Lagos, which accounts for more than half of Nigeria’s 2,000 confirmed infections, is due to gradually ease from Monday. Yet the impact on millions, particularly those living on the edge in daily informal labour has been acute.Amid limited government support, an outpouring of hundreds of initiatives has emerged across Lagos, providing food and essential goods. A range of food and aid distribution has been set up by NGOs, private businesses, community groups and local people.Fifehan started volunteering in the group started by Ann Ogunsulire, a marketing consultant, and Daryn Wober, a yoga teacher living in Oniru. Through Daryn’s yoga WhatsApp groups and by appealing to their friends, the couple solicited money to buy food and sanitary products. These donations are sent to their home and packaged and delivered on weekends.“We were feeding around 570-600 families each time we went out, in the space of around three or four streets,” says Wober. “Since the lockdown we deliver to about 1,000.”The group, now called Feed The Streets Lagos, keeps records of the locations, size and specific needs of the families they give aid to. “After a while we got to know these people, so we could better understand their needs,” says Ogunsulire. ”Lagos’ government says it has provided “food stimulus packages” to 250,000 people, and cash transfers to a further 250,000, out of the city’s 22 million people.Nigeria’s government is providing support to the poorest 3.6 million people, in payments of up to 20,000 naira ($51) a month.Yet the support only scratches the surface. Even before the effects of the lockdown, 87 million people in Nigeria lived in extreme poverty, according to the Brookings Institute.The support has also been too simplistic, Ogunsulire says. “People have needs that are not just food. You can have food but no cooking oil. You can have cooking oil but no fuel. You can be able to eat but not have water or other really vital needs.”Ten days into lockdown, Noella Nwakwesi, an interior designer, noticed several people in her neighbourhood in Lekki holding placards saying: “I am hungry”.“The numbers were growing everyday,” says Nwakwesi, who formed the Lekki Food Bank.Volunteers made up of young professionals, including bankers, consultants and pastors, distribute roughly 1,000 meals a day and 500 packages of dry food and water.Six days a week, by midday long queues stretch into empty streets, each person standing along chalked markings on the road, with police standing by enforcing social distancing.“We’ve been humbled by the donations,” Nwakwesi says. “We have a long-term goal to combat specifically food insecurity in our local communities.”Other groups like the Lagos Food Bank existed before the lockdown started, building on existing systems, donations and partnerships.Fast food and manufacturing companies have donated food packages and face masks. The group provides sanitisers and additional help targeted at mothers.Cardboard packages and plastic bags are delivered in vans all blazoned with the Lagos Food Bank Initiative green-and-white logo. A medical team at locations where help is distributed provides check-ups for locals.The Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACovid) is the most high-profile private sector initiative to emerge in recent weeks. The group, led by three Nigerian billionaires, has pledged 23 billion naira ($59m) to provide food aid for 10 million Nigerians.Yet help has also been highly inidual.Fighting restlessness amid the hours under lockdown, multimedia artist Taiye Idahor dug out sewing instruments that she’d long abandoned in storage. For a few hours a day, she started sowing masks from scraps of fabric, then handing them out to those who needed them on her street.“It’s just my little way to help where I can, I barely see people wearing them here in my neighbourhood”, she says. “People should support who and where you can. Nothing is too small.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other.

Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

The marketing model that makes up most of an influencer’s income is falling apart, with brands pulling out of lucrative sponsorship deals and advertising revenue plummeting. As we face a new economic era, it is unclear whether the aspirational lifestyle lauded by influencers can emerge unscathed. Could coronavirus provoke a reconfiguration of the influencer age?Payment for posts reflected this – businesses pay influencers with more than a million followers $10,000 or more for a one-off post endorsing their product.Yet despite creating an innovative new model that defined a digital era, the influencer industry was not without its issues. A saturation of social media marketing recently led to backlash, with many stars being forced to refocus their brand to appear more authentic after fears that they were alienating their fans with heavily posed and paid-for posts. High-profile scandals also rocked the industry, such as the Gabriel Grossman and Marissa Casey Fuchs “surprise” social-media proposal, which the Atlantic uncovered as having been pitched to brands, heavily staged and sponsored, and the now infamous Fyre festival which saw influencers being paid thousands of dollars to promote an event that had barely been organized and left attendees stranded on a beach in the Bahamas.2020 should have been the year for influencers to get back to their followers’ desire for “realness”. Instead, because of Covid-19, many influencers are being forced to focus on simply surviving 2020’s economic downturn rather than taking the chance to grow their businesses.“Due to the disruption in business operations a lot of companies are facing financial challenges,” explains Shane Barker, a digital strategist who offers consultancy services for companies using social media to boost their brand, and influencers hoping to reach the right brands and monetize their follower count. “In light of that, they are cutting down on all unnecessary expenses. Some are barely able to pay their employees, let alone hire influencers.”One of Shane’s clients, Chris Ruden, is a bodybuilder and amputee who uses his platform to share content on overcoming adversity. As one of many influencers who relies on speaking engagements and events to make up some of his income, Ruden has already experienced disruption as a result of coronavirus measures.While some popular influencers have attracted death threats after sharing images of glamorous trips despite social distancing measures, Barker believes that more sensitive content is crucial in order for influencers to future-proof their brand.“Influencers should create content that resonates with the current situation that people are in,” he says. “This does not mean that influencers from all industries should just start writing and talking about the pandemic. What I mean is that they should create content relevant to their niche, but keeping in mind what people are going through.”“I’ve always loved sharing workouts and healthy recipes, so for me it’s been more of an adaption,” she says. “People want to see home content right now as it’s relatable and we are all in the same boat. With more eyes now online, people are scrolling more than ever, so actually, as long as it’s fitting, authentic and tasteful, now is a great time to work with influencers.”Some even believe that this renewed awareness of authentic versus paid posts and the shift away from brand promotion is a good thing.“Biased product reviews were threatening to poison the well as people started to become disenchanted with self-serving influencers who had lost their objectivity,” says Michael Solomon, marketing professor and author of Social Media Marketing. “Where possible, influencers need to revert to a more altruistic message and find ways to help get through the crisis with constructive suggestions. In times of instability, people look to trusted sources and those that deliver will be remembered after the crisis is over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4796b855e5653619f8961e861bca22057b70f4ee/0_293_4803_2882/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ae9b1b1994642d55064b5b0dcd060a6","title":"sport lockdown someone pulled the rug out from under the summer","story":"Our sports team on how they have kept readers supplied with nostalgia, commentary, humour – and even the odd exclusiveSport’s unravelling happened haphazardly – and then suddenly. With Champions League and Europa League games behind played behind closed doors or postponed, and plenty of debate about whether other sports should continue, the turning point was Arsenal’s head coach Mikel Arteta’s diagnosis with coronavirus, which popped up on Thursday 12 March, a few hours after Boris Johnson had warned that many families would lose their loved ones. The next day, everything fell away.Other sports fans will have their own shoulder-slumping moments mine was coming back to my desk to be told that Wales’s Six Nations match with Scotland on the Saturday and the Masters golf in April had both been scrapped, within minutes of each other. That day the Premier League, Women’s Super League, Scottish Premier League, London Marathon and England’s Test series with Sri Lanka all went. Somehow that day’s Gold Cup at Cheltenham went ahead, seeming even then to misread the mood – it does even more so now.“Sport was actually quite good wasn’t it,” tweeted our chief sportswriter, Barney Ronay. After a spell in which the ground shifted beneath our feet almost daily, we’ve settled into some kind of routine. Inevitably we’re covering a lot about postponements, cancellations and hopes for restarts. Our reporter David Conn was quickly on to fears that the virus had spread after the Liverpool-Atlético Madrid game, and the  has looked hard at evidence linking the virus to Cheltenham. Otherwise we’ve had time to wallow – not too much, but enough – in some of the great moments of the past, not least in our retro minute-by-minute series and the My Favourite Game series. Plus we’ve delivered interviews with some sporting personalities – including Andy Cole, Fabio Capello, Ada Hegerberg, Rory McIlroy – that we would have been proud of in the busiest times. Sport isn’t even close to the most important thing right now. But do we miss it? Like crazy.It’s like a metaphysical conundrum: how do you write about sport that doesn’t exist? In a way, it’s analogous to describing the silence that follows a piece of music: yes, technically you’re trying to define the shape of something that isn’t there. But if you listen closely enough, you can feel in the absence the weight of what was once present. And perhaps it’s only in the void that sport leaves that you can truly appreciate its worth.How do you fill the void? Archive features and retrospectives are perhaps an inevitable upshot of the shutdown, a chance to reconsider the past with a fresh eye and the benefit of time. But our readers don’t simply want to wallow in nostalgia they want to know when sport will return, what it will feel and taste like when it does. That’s the balance I’ve tried to strike, and in a way it’s the balance we’re all striving for: equal parts realism and escapism, the same bewitching brew that drew us all to sport in the first place.Sports journalism’s rhythm is defined by the diary. But that diary is empty, at least in the immediate future, despite ongoing meetings to provide a roadmap of how and when live sport can return. Global championships, events and league seasons have been cancelled or postponed, falling like a row of dominoes in the past couple of months. And so the first part of lockdown has been shaped by a news agenda chasing what will no longer be happening this spring and summer and the repercussions of those cancellations or delays. That has now been replaced by talk of when live sport might get up and running again, and the ethics of such a return.There has been a glaring hole left in the absence of any live sport to cover. Interviews and features, too, are usually pegged to the news agenda or forthcoming events. Beyond those related to the pandemic itself, we have recast interviews or features to reflect the new reality of lockdown. We have also looked for different ways of engaging with our readers. Our hugely popular live minute-by-minutes have had a retro makeover, some pegged to anniversaries or events that had been in the diary we have brought in regular columnists such as the England cricketer Moeen Ali to answer readers’ questions and commissioned follow-up features off the back of readers’ responses to articles.As the lockdown continues, and the news ebbs rather than flows, we are embracing opportunities to turn back the clock, source interviews that we could never quite find the right time to publish, and investigate wider issues.Before all this, the problems we were most accustomed to dealing with on the ’s Football Weekly podcast involved how best to cram in all the big weekend talking points on a Monday morning. All four isions of the English league had to be discussed, along with the latest news from Scotland and the major continental leagues, as well as any other business. That’s a “hella lotta” football chat.Presenter Max Rushden and I immediately promised our audience that, health permitting, we would continue recording twice a week until somebody higher up told us to stop. We hoped it would go some way towards maintaining our own sanity as well as that of the hundreds of thousands of listeners for whom Football Weekly seems to provide a reassuring sense of normality and routine. Our listening figures suggest that if anything, football has been holding us back for years.With no action to discuss, Max and I have had to come up with other ways to fill time. The most difficult part? Finding the right balance between discussions about particularly grim virus-related issues and more frivolous topics of discussion, such as the conspicuous absence of bookshelves full of intellectually weighty tomes in the background of each other’s “home studios”, and general chit-chat about how we’ve been coping in a world where pub-going is not an option. It should go without saying that our guests and listeners have been a source of welcome inspiration, their contributions and correspondence regularly sending us off on strange, often hilarious and always welcome tangents.While Max and I don’t like to talk about the selfless manner in which we are putting our lives on the line each week in the interests of boosting public morale like a pair of modern-day Vera Lynns, we recently received an email from a nurse named David from the United States who could identify with the stress and hardship we are currently not enduring.“Your voices cheerfully ring through the darkness of semi-rural Connecticut during my long drives into my night shift and balance out my thoughts of how many Covid patients my hospital now has, or how many of my co-workers have either tested positive or are now under quarantine,” he wrote. “I am sure there are thousands and thousands of people like me around the world that deeply appreciate what you do. Please carry on.”Just try to stop us.Maybe I was in denial but covering my last, pre-lockdown, match - Sheffield United 1 Norwich 0 on 7 March - the sight of locals staggering past Bramall Lane laden with toilet rolls failed to alert me to the surreal nightmare ahead.Back home in Newcastle, another train was hurtling down the tracks and about to blindside everyone. A largely Saudi Arabian-funded consortium was buying the city’s football club for £300m. Devoid of the usual framework of matches and press conferences – which provided welcome structure and routine for us “patch reporters” who routinely work from home – there was something to write about again.Instead of debating whether teams should be playing 3-4-3 or 4-2-3-1, there is Newcastle United’s extraordinary role in a bitter proxy war between Saudi and Qatar to consider: a Doha-based satellite broadcaster has urged the Premier League to block the takeover, arguing that Saudi Arabia should be accountable for a pirate network that illegally transmits English top-tier games.Amnesty are rightly concerned about Saudi’s human rights record but Newcastle fans are broadly delighted - and extremely excited - by the prospective departure of the club’s loathed owner, Mike Ashley. It’s an ethical quagmire. Sophisticated sports-washing or Saudi modernisation?Match reporting is infinitely more straightforward – and adrenaline-rich. Perhaps the biggest thing I crave is the adrenaline: reports invariably have to be filed against tight deadlines, either on the final whistle or, at night games, as “runners”, with chunks of copy delivered at half-time. They always involve a mild sense of panic. I miss that.The Premier League has been hit hard by the crisis – and the supply of sporting news has almost dried up.Even now, looking back at it from a distance, the speed with which everything changed feels bewildering. On Saturday 7 March, a few weeks and half a lifetime ago, I was at Twickenham, reporting on England’s victory against Wales in the Six Nations, one in a crowd of 80,000. Boris Johnson was there too. Five days later he was on TV telling us that we were in the midst of the “worst public health crisis for a generation”. And then, all of a sudden, someone pulled the rug out from under the summer. The rest of the rugby season was postponed, then the beginning of the cricket season too, and the Masters, the Open, Wimbledon and the Olympics, all events I was supposed to cover.Instead, I’m a sportswriter with no sport to write, apart from marble racing videos and back garden marathons. I’ve been craving some escape from it all. Sport’s a glorious triviality, after all. So I’ve been busy losing myself in writing about my favourite old games and players, or reporting on forgotten stories about the Moscow Olympic boycott and the CIA’s attempts to recruit Soviet athletes in the 1960s, anything that I think will entertain readers, and give them something else to read and think and talk about, to try to help them forget about everything else, if only for a few precious minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14f67f00dd3e2bb4443321d69fac80070c243b21/0_72_2823_1694/master/2823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9877a99f38596513460beaea01fda995","title":"coronavirus travel advice refund change summer holiday rights","story":"The pandemic has left thousands of holidaymakers out of pocket. Here’s a guide to your rightsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis have been felt everywhere, but one of the hardest hit sectors has been the holiday industry. With resorts closed and all but essential journeys banned in countries across the world, 2020 looks set to be the year that travel was put on hold.Less than two months into the pandemic, thousands of holidays, honeymoons, backpacking trips, cruises, and city breaks have either been cancelled, or look like they will be.The shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of consumers out of pocket, in some cases by more than £20,000. It has also left the travel industry fighting to survive. Here, we try to navigate you through the chaos.No. But that hasn’t stopped airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or heading into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by “denied boarding” rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.The problem is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. Many airlines are making it near impossible to get refunds in the hope that customers will reschedule or accept vouchers instead.After initially promising to reimburse consumers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said they should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, which it will then refund if not used by the end of the year. Alternatively, it says customers can wait until the “crisis has passed” for a refund.Refunds at British Airways are being processed only by customer services, which is proving difficult to contact. It’s a similar story across the sector, and the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, has so far declined to intervene. Airlines have asked the EU to suspend the rules and allow vouchers instead, although it is hard to see how this could be applied retrospectively.Accepting replacement vouchers is risky. While Ryanair looks safe, some airlines have already collapsed and others, including Norwegian, are in bailout talks.Coby Benson, a solicitor at the specialist flight compensation firm Bott and Co, says the law is on the side of cash refunds. He advises customers to submit their refund request using the following text:There is evidence that passengers have been getting refunds – but only after very long waits.If the airline does not respond or refuses to comply, you can issue small court proceedings or use the Alternative Dispute Resolution. You will need the airline’s address, which can usually be found online.Benson says all claims for flights that started or ended in the UK can be heard in Britain’s courts. The other option is to approach your bank card provider (see below).Amazingly, several airlines are still running flights in and out of UK airports, meaning the trip is not cancelled.Richard Colbey, a barrister at Lamb Chambers, says the fact that it is currently illegal to go on holiday to, say Lisbon, means that the contract between the passenger and the airline can be deemed to be “frustrated”. In such cases a refund is due, although the customer may have to resort to the courts to get the money.The easier option for many will be to claim on travel insurance. Because the government advised against all but essential travel, policies should pay cancellation claims provided you bought it before the pandemic was declared on 11 March.Package tour operators are required to refund customers within 14 days when a trip is cancelled. However, in many cases refunds have been denied and holidaymakers told they must rebook or accept vouchers.Your replacement voucher or new booking is protected by the government-backed Atol scheme in the event that the tour operator collapses before the trip is taken.If a refund is not offered, write to the travel firm stating that you want one under the terms of the package travel and linked travel arrangement regulations 2018, stressing that you will not accept vouchers. If have lost your job or income, ask to be moved to the front of the queue.Travel insurers will not pay out when the tour operator is legally obliged to refund and is still trading.The next big date in the holiday calendar is 25 May, the start of half-term in some parts of the UK, but trips look unlikely to go ahead. For those planning DIY trips, it seems highly unlikely that European countries will be accepting guests – France said this week its beaches would remain closed until June.If you are due to travel and your trip is yet to be cancelled, the advice is to do nothing. If the Foreign Office continues to advise against all but essential travel, your tour operator will have cancel and a full refund will be due.Even if you have no intention of travelling, do not cancel the holiday yourself as you will lose your booking and the possible refund. It is a similar story for UK trips. Whether these will happen will depend on the lockdown measures still in place. Holiday cottages in Cornwall, for example, may technically be accessible in May and June. But will the government allow such travel?The company is offering fee-free cancellations for those who booked their trips before 15 March and planned to check in before the end of May. Stays starting on 1 June onwards, and those booked after 15 March, currently carry the normal cancellation terms, unless you are ill and can show that there are extenuating circumstances. Airbnb is constantly changing its terms, so check for the latest updates.P\u0026ampO is still running its services and therefore is not cancelling, although its would-be passengers clearly cannot use the service during the lockdown. It is only offering vouchers, which have to be used for future bookings.Many owners have offered alternative dates later in the year, which could be a very attractive option come August, but this will not suit everyone.On 23 March the government ordered all holiday accommodation to close, except in a few circumstances. Until the ban is lifted, bookers can insist on a refund, arguing that the contract was deemed to be frustrated. You can expect a battle, if our mailbag is anything to go by, but the competition regulator has warned firms that they could face legal action if they do not refund customers.This is a conundrum lots of people are facing. Generally, the advice is to pay the balance owed, because if you do nothing you are deemed to have cancelled and will lose the deposit.If the holiday is subsequently cancelled you will get all your money back. This week easyJet Holidays said customers who had paid deposits on trips this summer could use them next year. Other operators may follow suit, so it is worth asking if you would like to delay a year.Ultimately, consumers are going to have to consider their financial situation. If you paid a deposit of £50 on a £2,000 cruise that you now have no intention of taking, you would probably be better off accepting the £50 loss than paying the rest and fighting to get it back.Those with good-quality (expensive) annual or single policies bought before the virus was declared a pandemic have the best chance of receiving a payout. However, insurers will not be paying out where the tour operatorairline simply refuses a refund or offers vouchers instead. Most policies bought after 11 March will not offer any Covid-19 related claims.If your airline collapses before your departure, half of policies – those with scheduled airline failure cover – should compensate customers. If you have to cancel a holiday in, say, September because you were due to take elderly parents – and they have been advised by the governmentdoctor against travelling – this claim should succeed, provided you bought the policy and holiday before March.If your legitimate claim is turned down, the Financial Ombudsman Service can adjudicate your dispute free of charge. There are signs that some travel insurers will be rejecting claims and hoping the claimants give up. Do not.Consumers who bought their trips using bank cards do have two other avenues to go down if they are denied a refund – a chargeback or a section 75 claim.Where there has a been a breach of contract – the holidayflight has been not provided – you can ask your bank to reverse the payments. There is no legal obligation on the bank to process a chargeback, and the retailer can object, but consumers have had success with them in the past. If your online travel agent, in particular, will not deal with your refund, a chargeback is worth trying.Section 75 claims are a legal obligation and make the credit card firm jointly liable for the service bought, provided it cost more than £100 and you bought it directly from the provider. If the airline goes bust and you bought the ticket from it directly, the credit card provider has to refund you.The problem is the banks are reluctant to process section 75 claims in the best of times, and there have been reports of some refusing to process them in the current climate. When things finally calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.You can. Whether it is wise to is another matter. The safer trips to book are probably in self-contained accommodation that will not require much social mixing. Self-guided walking or cycling trips may be possible. But it is unclear whether countries will be allowing tourists in.It’s probably worth waiting to see how the lockdown measures are to be eased. Once that becomes clear, expect a flurry of bookings, particularly for UK-based accommodation. If you do want to go abroad, ferries could be a better option than flying.House swapping could be an answer to our holiday needs as families look for a change of scene. Exchanging homes would allow the physical isolation that may still be required. It is also (almost) free.The ’s home exchange service is an excellent starting point and is very strong on UK exchanges. A six-month plan costs £35. Homeexchange is good for international swaps but it costs $150 a year to be a member. There are a host of other sites that connect people looking to swap.

We need to map out a great vision for the kind of new normal that can exist after this pandemic. Perhaps the leadership doesn’t feel now’s the right time to do that.”The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Reynolds says those are arguments Labour can make later. For now, the priority is pressing for urgent assistance for struggling households and families. “I’m very sympathetic to UBI, but realistically you’ve got to use the channels we’ve got,” he says.“The fact that we have come out with pragmatic suggestions of how to help people right now, does not take away from the fact that we want and are committed to a full alternative to universal credit: we want to work with people and build a big coalition around that.That approach has been replicated across the shadow cabinet.Annaliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has praised the chancellor’s economic rescue schemes but pointed out the gaps in them. And Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, has lauded frontline police officers but demanded more action to protect domestic violence victims.Labour believes this is what the public expects of the official opposition at a time of national crisis.Starmer held the first two of a string of planned “Call Keir” virtual meetings, with voters from Bury and the Tees Valley this week.These meetings, and polling seen by Labour strategists, are telling them the public don’t want to hear knee-jerk criticism of the government. “The approach we’re getting from the public is, ‘All of us need to be together, getting through this,’” said a party source.They also say the public believe the right time to challenge the government’s handling of the outbreak head-on will be after the worst has passed – though Starmer has stepped up his attacks in the past week, telling Johnson the UK had been slow into lockdown, and now risks “falling behind the rest of the world”.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth – one of the few frontbenchers to remain in the same job when Starmer took over – has been praised by Matt Hancock for his constructive approach but his frustration with the government’s stance also appeared to bubble over this week.Ashworth has been calling for the test-and-track approach now being pursued by Hancock for some time – and believes the health secretary should have started much earlier to recruit the necessary army of contact-tracers he has now acknowledged will be needed.“This lockdown is not a strategy in itself to defeat the virus,” Ashworth told the . “This lockdown buys us time to put in place a strategy. And my big fear is that in the same way they failed to prepare the testing we needed, and they failed to prepare the PPE for frontline staff, it looks like they are failing to prepare the tracing capacity we need.”Most of Starmer’s frontbench team have been in contact with their Conservative opposite numbers, and the shadow cabinet are receiving briefings from relevant civil servants.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, says that while they don’t want to “bombard” the civil service, “it’s our job as an opposition to be constructively critical”.And Reynolds says these private conversations are no substitute for asking a question publicly, in parliament – even virtually.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 201415, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Boris Johnson briefed Starmer directly this week, as part of what the prime minister claimed was part his effort to “build the biggest possible consensus,” for how to manage the next phase of the crisis.Both sides insist that falls far short of coopting Labour into decision-making, however, with Starmer’s team regarding chatter about a “national government” as a Westminster bubble fantasy.﻿When Johnson returned to the Downing Street press conference on Thursday, he appeared to reflect Labour’s repeated recent calls for an “exit strategy”, avoiding the phrase repeatedly used by Starmer but promising a “road map” and a “menu of options”.Speaking afterwards, Starmer made clear he felt vindicated. “I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I’m pleased that we’re going to see a plan, we’ll look at it when we see it, but it’s a step in the right direction.”With Corbyn watching from high above him on the backbenches, Starmer used a telling phrase at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, to describe how he sees his own approach – and which helps explain his caution. “I try to be careful to stick to the data and the evidence, rather than just coming up with an opinion,” he told Dominic Raab."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/463b7da90040aaf5a075ac6ddfda4990688e8516/0_322_4834_2901/master/4834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b01359b2ffe1d2b94c30f622522faf","title":"uk seeks access to eu health cooperation in light of coronavirus","story":"Government now wants close links with early warning system despite Brexit, source saysThe British government is quietly seeking access to the European Union’s pandemic warning system, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit, the  has learned.The UK is seeking “something akin to membership” of the EU’s early warning and response system (EWRS), which has played a critical role in coordinating Europe’s response to the coronavirus, as well as to earlier pandemics such as bird flu. According to an EU source, this would be “pretty much the same” as membership of the system.The government’s enthusiasm in the privacy of the negotiating room contrasts with noncommittal public statements. Detailed negotiating objectives published in February merely stated that the UK was “open to exploring cooperation between the UK and EU in other specific and narrowly defined areas where this is in the interest of both sides, for example on matters of health security”.Health was not even mentioned in the government’s written statement to Parliament, aside from a reference to pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, the Daily  reported on 1 March that No 10 had blocked the Department of Health’s request to be part of the EWRS.A government spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether the UK was seeking a form of membership or participation in the EWRS, but referred back to the February negotiating objectives.In private, the coronavirus, which had claimed at least 26,771 lives in the UK by Thursday, appears to have altered government thinking.“There was not much appetite from the UK at the beginning,” said the EU source, referring to cooperation on health. “That’s been corrected. They are keen and they are keen to be seen to be keen. Both sides want close cooperation.”However, the EU is not prepared to offer the UK full membership of the EWRS, an online platform set up in 1998 where public authorities share information about health emergencies.Instead, EU officials propose to “plug the UK into” the system when a pandemic emerges, similar to arrangements for other non-EU countries.Health security does not feature in the UK negotiating text sent in private to the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, although EU officials have received a “non-paper” outlining government aims on health.During the April meetings, officials discussed lockdown exit strategies and launching a joint procurement scheme on therapeutics in intensive care. No decision has been taken to launch this bulk-buying programme. first reported in March that the UK was not taking part in any of the EU’s four procurement schemes, missing bulk-buying efforts on personal protective equipment for medical workers, ventilators and testing kit – despite having attended relevant meetings.Meanwhile, among NHS senior managers there is anxiety that Brexit talks risk “significant elements of health being forgotten about”, said Layla McCay, the international director of the NHS Confederation.“NHS organisations have been stood up and stood down and stood up again for potentially a no-deal Brexit,” she said. “If a quite thorough future relationship for health matters is not on track come June, then the NHS is going to have to start to prepare for specific disruption next year as a result of Brexit, and it will have to do so while also facing both winter and coronavirus challenges. It will be a significant extra ask.”British membership of the EWRS and broader EU health network “strengthen our ability to respond as effectively as possible” to health emergencies, McCay added.The UK government spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our citizens is a top priority. The UK is ready to discuss how our citizens can be kept safe and benefit from continued international cooperation on health security following the end of the transition period, where it is in our mutual interest.“Any such arrangements must align with the fundamental principles of respecting the UK’s political and economic independence, recognition of the UK and EU’s status as sovereign equals, and ensuring the UK has control over its own laws.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/014abf5ef10b328ddec8ba3ff6213e28c2b10c68/0_194_5428_3257/master/5428.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5bcb27e80b6b5aad5d6ad3ddf2833421","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated dailyHampstead theatre and the  have teamed up to stream a series of acclaimed productions for free. #AIWW: The Arrest of Ai Weiwei, directed by James Macdonald, is based on a book by Barnaby Martin about the 81-day detention and interrogation of Ai Weiwei by the Chinese authorities in 2011.

The institution’s rhythms and rituals have changed little since it was first broadcast on New Year’s Day 1924: there is poetry in the daily litany and mystery in its terminology. “The radio’s prayer,” Carol Ann Duffy called it. For Seamus Heaney it was “a sibilant penumbra”.The forecast reminds us we’re a maritime nation and its map binds us to our continent, covering not only our own coasts and waters but an area extending from Norway to Portugal to Iceland. There is democracy in its geography, where tiny Fair Isle carries as much heft as mighty Biscay while Lundy, a sliver of rock in the Bristol Channel, is equal in importance to the Irish Sea. And from the salty old seadog in his brine-encrusted fishing boat to the merchant banker on his yacht, the shipping forecast, all seafarers are equally reliant on it.Of the four daily broadcasts by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, my favourite is in the early morning. Usually this one goes out at 05.20, but in our current emergency it’s broadcast at 05.33, those 13 minutes representing the only significant schedule shift since the service was suspended altogether during the second world war. Before this, no disaster, no crisis and certainly no Test match climax had shunted the iron horse of the schedule from its position.While many prefer the cosy, late-night feel of the 00.48 forecast, all soothing nocturnal intimacy and somnolent talk of “falling slowly”, for me you can’t beat being roused from sleep by the familiar rhythmic intonation of the pre-dawn broadcast. Every morning I’m coaxed awake by a meteorological gazetteer of familiar names – Tyne, Dogger, Fisher – and cryptic crossword clues of forecast detail, on the face of it impenetrable but actually fairly straightforward. First there’s the wind and its direction and predicted strength according to the Beaufort Scale, north-westerly five or six, followed by the weather conditions, rain later, and finally the visibility, good becoming moderate.There’s reassurance in regularity. The forecast always progresses in the same order around its 31 sea areas, beginning with Viking off the coast of Norway and moving broadly clockwise, zigzagging across the North Sea, along the Channel, turning south towards the Iberian peninsula then tracing the Atlantic fringe back up to south-east Iceland.For those not out at sea, it’s a journey to fire the imagination without lifting your head from the pillow, a 31-stop tour better measured in duvet togs than kilometres, an odyssey in the mind through familiar places – Dover, Hebrides, Wight – and locations that seem to defy conventional mapping: Fisher, Sole, North Utsire.Not many people can say they’ve been to Utsira. I have. North and south. (The island off south-west Norway has been officially spelled with an “a” since 1924, though neither North or South Utsire appeared in the shipping forecast until they were introduced in 1984.) Reached by a heaving, churning 70-minute ferry ride across some of the most tempestuous waters in northern Europe, Utsira wears its forecast fame lightly. Not many places are namechecked on the BBC eight times a day, but forecast familiarity hasn’t inspired a flood of visitors. When I explained to the captain of the ferry why I was there (he’d assumed that, with Utsira boasting Norway’s widest variety of avian life, I must be a birdwatcher) he blinked a couple of times, said “OK”, and climbed back up to the wheelhouse.By chance I happened to be there the weekend Utsira’s football club was holding its annual knees-up, and I wangled an invite. Fielding a team from a population of a little over 200 is achievement enough, but the impressive collection of trophies I saw in a cabinet suggested that on the football field at least, Utsira was punching above its weight.I’ve now travelled to, or through, all of the shipping forecast’s 31 sea areas, which means the daily broadcast invocation conjures up my night on the lash with Ustira’s footballers, along with many other faces and places to which I can return without getting wet.In area Thames, for example, I was lucky enough, after a six-month visa application process, to visit the Principality of Sealand, since 1967 a self-declared independent nation on a former British gun emplacement in the North Sea. The platform on two vast concrete legs eight miles off Harwich looks like a North Sea Stonehenge. Arriving was unforgettable: Prince Michael of Sealand himself escorted me out there on a royal RIB and the micro-nation remains the only country in the world I’ve been winched into. Once I was through immigration, the pizza delivery leaflet pinned to a corkboard represented one of the greatest examples of optimism I’ve ever seen.I’m convinced that wherever you go, however unpromising or uninspiring a place might appear, you’ll always find something to make the visit worthwhile: a quirky piece of local history perhaps, or someone with a hell of a story to tell. It’s a theory that has served me well wherever I’ve been – and I’ve been to Stevenage – and has only failed me once.Shipping forecast area Fisher widens into the North Sea from a small stretch of the west coast of Jutland, northern Denmark. The only place to visit is the port of Hanstholm, where I spent a long weekend. A really long weekend during which I found nothing to do and nothing to see. Nobody hangs around Hanstholm they roll off the overnight ferry from Norway and head straight off. Not me. My weekend there must have come close to contravening the part of the Geneva Convention dealing with sensory deprivation. To give you an idea, according to someone I spoke to, the name Hanstholm is derived from an old Norse word meaning “islet of the glove”. The story goes that many years ago a woman once dropped a glove there.Fortunately the broadcast sweeps me past Fisher and on to other memories, other places I can revisit without leaving home. There was the time in Galicia when I sat for hours and watched the sun set over the Atlantic from the tip of Cape Finisterre – from finis terrae, the end of the earth, a holy place since way before Christianity. It gave its name to the sea area until 2002, when the Met Office renamed it FitzRoy to avoid confusion with the French and Spanish forecasts, whose Finisterre is of different dimensions. FitzRoy is named for Vice-admiral Robert FitzRoy, best-known as captain of the Beagle when Charles Darwin was aboard, but who in 1854 founded what became the Met Office, set up specifically to provide weather information for seafarers.As the area forecast reaches its conclusion I think of how I once stood on a black beach at the foot of a black mountain looking out at a grey sea under a grey sky, a monochrome vista that was the legacy of a 1973 volcanic eruption on the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar) off southern Iceland. Standing on land that’s younger than you are is a sobering way to finish any journey.For all the poetic inspiration of its curious place names and recondite meteorological phrasing, the shipping forecast is there to save lives. The number of disasters and tragedies averted thanks to sailors and skippers being made aware of impending storms and high seas is impossible to calculate. The reassurance of its rhythmic incantation goes much further though, way beyond the seafarer. The daily recital wakens and nurtures something deep within us, a maritime people, its poetry of protection an evocative reminder that not everything about being an island nation is insular or inward-looking. The beauty of its composition and delivery serves only to elevate the forecast further in our national consciousness.“The shipping forecast is the closest I ever came to reading out poetry on the air,” the BBC broadcaster Charlotte Green once told me – and she should know, having been effectively the voice of the forecast for years. “There’s a real appeal about it, even if you don’t know anything about the sea and don’t know what the terms mean. It’s absolutely mesmerising.”• Charlie Connelly is author of Attention All Shipping: A Journey Round The Shipping Forecast (Little, Brown)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ebe2bd33124c372a6531185c2eb4ac215c8f7e/0_225_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d0b9e6cc25f76c14a749d239377afd","title":"michael bloomberg expands influence network within democratic party","story":"The former New York mayor spent almost $1bn on his failed run for president but is poised to have a major say in the 2020 campaignThe former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg spent almost a billion dollars to try to win the Democratic nomination but his audacious bid ended with victory only in tiny American Samoa.That embarrassing defeat was held up by some critics as proof it is still hard to use spending power alone to win a US election. But Bloomberg’s enormous wealth and influence is still strong in the party via a growing network of groups, former associates and allies sprinkled across the Democratic party universe.Even before Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race in May the media mogul billionaire vowed he would work to defeat Donald Trump even if he didn’t get the nomination.That’s precisely what he is doing. “He was one of the biggest contributors to Democratic causes before he ran and he still is after,” Abe Rakov, a veteran Democratic campaign manager, said of Bloomberg. “There are a lot of organizations and programs across the country that would be in really bad shape if he decided to disengage after he ran.”The initial plan was to continue to fuel the massive field operation Bloomberg’s campaign built. The former mayor changed his mind and instead transferred $18m to the Democratic National Committee, the main organization charged with boosting the party’s presidential nominee.It’s possible Bloomberg could move more money as well. The Bloomberg campaign also transferred leases for over a dozen of its field offices to the DNC, adding to the DNC’s campaign spaces around the country.Bloomberg himself is staying visible, working with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, to launch a testing and tracing program. He spoke via video conference call during Cuomo’s press briefing on Thursday. The governor, currently one of the most prominent Democrats in the country, said in late April that Bloomberg was working with him.A network of operatives and Bloomberg-connected political organizations is also active in Democratic presidential circles. Bill Knapp, a longtime Bloomberg adviser, recently joined Priorities USA, the Super Pac the Joe Biden campaign has signaled is its outside organization of choice for the general election.During Bloomberg’s campaign, he poured almost $67m into a new digital and technology firm called Hawkfish. Hawkfish has stayed active since Bloomberg dropped out. The firm is reportedly in talks to work for Biden’s presidential campaign although nothing is finalized.Hawkfish also got into negotiations to buy another Democratic analytics firm, Blue Labs Analytics, according to four Democrats with knowledge of those talks, but negotiations fell through. Hawkfish and Blue Labs still have ties.In Washington Democratic analytics circles Hawkfish has become a hot topic as a firm trying to elbow its way into the group of top-tier data analytics firms.The business discussions between Hawkfish and various campaigns and outlets within the Democratic campaign universe underscores how Bloomberg-connected operatives and groups continue to set down deep roots within the party.Some former digital and data staffers for the Bloomberg campaign have talked with Biden campaign officials about joining the campaign, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those talks.The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment.“I think Mayor Bloomberg has made it very plain, through his actions and his investments, his commitment to defeating Donald Trump and helping to elect Democrats across the country,” said the former Michigan congressman Mark Schauer, who supported Bloomberg during the mayor’s short-lived presidential campaign. “I think those contributions are valuable, they’re significant, and they’ll have an impact this November.”The end goal for Bloomberg, 78, is still somewhat murky.The former mayor has repeatedly said he would use his considerable resources to oust Trump from office. But the rapid expansion of Bloomberg-connected groups and operatives around Washington also suggests Bloomberg intends to hold a seat at the table among the most influential Democratic party leaders, albeit one outside of elected office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Classes will be split in two and the groups will alternate between lessons at school and at home.Hygiene measures being adopted across Europe include strict handwashing and disinfection regimes, physical distancing and the demarcation of playgrounds into zones to ensure pupils do not mix more than necessary. Children will have to file out of classrooms at different times to maintain physical distancing.Germany has temporarily removed sport and music lessons from the curriculum because they are considered too great a risk, but older pupils already returned to sit exams last month. Nurseries will remain closed for all children, except those of key workers, for the time being.French lower secondary schools may only return in areas where the virus is not widely circulating. All ball games and contact sports will be banned and objects touched by more than one pupil must be disinfected. Classes will be staggered and made up of a maximum of 15 pupils, and breaks will held in shifts to avoid overcrowding in corridors and playgrounds.Many teachers say the draft health protocol detailing the regulations is unworkable, especially for classes of younger children.Céline Prier-Cheron, a trade union representative and teacher at a primary school in the Eure-et-Loir, told French TV: “How do you explain to children in nursery schools that they have to raise their hand to take an object, get up, go talk to a friend while respecting the barrier and distancing rules?“This health protocol cannot be applied as it is, especially in nursery schools. Teaching is based on the handling of objects, especially in nursery. If we have to disinfect objects each time a child has handled them, it’ll be impossible.”The parents’ federation, the FCPE, tweeted that parents were reluctant to send children back to school. “That is what our members are telling us, but they are obviously also under constraints from their employers,” it wrote. “But there are still too many uncertainties.”The president of Germany’s main teachers’ union, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, said he supported the plan to teach children in alternating shifts, but that regulating hygiene measures was a “mammoth task”. Despite the phased reopenings, scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution.Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germany’s leading coronavirus expert, who led the team.Drosten’s study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April.He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus.Data on children has been scant because of the lack of tests that have been carried out on them, often because they show few if any symptoms.“The end result is as clear as glass,” Drosten said on his podcast with the broadcaster NDR. “Children do not have significantly different concentrations of the virus in their respiratory passages compared to adults.”Drosten said children were as likely to spread the virus as adults, particularly given their social behaviour, including an inability to practice physical distancing, their increased mobility and a tendency to sing and cry – activities proven to give the virus droplets as much force as a cough or a sneeze. Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany’s leading disease control body, the Robert Koch Institute, said on Thursday that children play just as important a role in spreading the disease as adults. “They can be infected, they can excrete the virus and they can infect others,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 2","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:At least 3,357,450 people have been infected and at least 238,787 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak, due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes.Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, the country’s police chief said late on Friday, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. More than 700 migrants were taken into custody, including young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, during Friday’s raid in a downtown area where thousands of migrants and asylum seekers live, rights groups said.Russia has had another record daily increase, with 9,623 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the total to 124,054.Reuters reported the nationwide death toll rose to 1,222 after 57 people died in the previous 24 hours, according to Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre. Russia has been in partial lockdown since the end of March.Officials have allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir, which appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19.Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19.A nursing home in New York has reported a “horrifying” death toll of 98 people from Covid-19 as residential facilities continue to emerge as a deadly source of outbreaks around the world.The death toll at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan is one of the worst such outbreaks in the US and caused a shock even in hard-hit New York, where the official state tally of nursing home deaths listed only 13 at that particular home as of Friday.)fficials at the 705-bed centre later confirmed that up to 46 residents who tested positive for Covid-19 had died, as well as an additional 52 people suspected to have had the virus, Associated Press reported. Some died at the nursing home and others in hospitals.The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been accused of changing the criteria for counting Covid-19 tests after he claimed victory in reaching the target of 100,000 a day. Critics said that a large proportion of the 122,000 tests counted on Friday were tests that had been mailed to addresses but not yet carried out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are there in my area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The announcements follow lengthy discussions between the Treasury and UK lenders, which are expected to continue throughout the weekend before the scheme is formally launched on Monday morning.Stephen Jones, chief executive of the banking lobby group UK Finance, said bank staff were “working incredibly hard to get money to those viable businesses that need it”, and that lenders were working at pace to get the new scheme up and running.Some banks feared the fast-track application for BBLS would mean having to cut corners on affordability checks that would put them in breach of the Consumer Credit Act. The Treasury confirmed, however, that it would introduce retrospective legislation which would allow them to skip those checks to try get money to businesses faster.Kevin Hollinrake, a Conservative MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking welcomed the Treasury’s announcements, saying the standard interest rate was “fantastic” for small firms. He also said that changes to consumer protection rules were reasonable.“In the current circumstances, business people will have to take a risk to get through this,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca956af7b2df0859445c4d454b34df5d67c0e145/0_128_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f21c94b191f95c30e8b280c7e60070ac","title":"islanders bristle at idea of being used as uk test site to end lockdown","story":"Many in the Outer Hebrides recoil at Michael Gove’s talk of easing restrictions early The exposed, austere islands of the Outer Hebrides carry the beautiful Gaelic name of Innse Gall, or “islands of the strangers”. Against a backdrop of big skies, lonely farmhouses and sandy beaches, physical distancing comes easily here.In small communities, such as those on Uist, isolation and the vast open spaces have preserved the local population from the devastation wrought elsewhere by the Covid-19 pandemic. Like everywhere else, lockdown has been strictly enforced and observed. Travel has been highly restricted – only lorry drivers and essential workers have been allowed on to the ferries since 16 March. And, as of last week, this archipelago of six principal islands linked by causeways has had no confirmed cases so far.It is this very particular geographic and social profile that has led ministers to see islands such as Uist as the perfect location in which to test strategies to end the lockdown. The notion has been floated by several scientists and endorsed by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, who said last week there was “scientific justification” for piloting measures such as contact tracing to “relax measures at a progressively greater rate” on some island communities before the rest of the UK.So are islanders rushing to volunteer to throw off the shackles of lockdown? Not a bit. In fact some want it to go on even longer.“People either want a lockdown as long as everyone else, or an extended lockdown,” Uisdean Robertson said. The councillor for North Uist, a ward in Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the Western Isles local authority, said his constituents were evenly split and no one had contacted him to press for an early end to the lockdown.“When you have the Michael Goves of the world, people that are remote from here, coming out with that kind of stuff,” Robertson said, “there was some irritation. Guinea pigs was one of the terms used.”The reason for the irritation is that the situation in Uist is not as clear cut as it seems from the outside. There are a substantial number of retirees and two care homes on the islands. The nearest hospital is in Stornoway, a ferry ride away. Some islanders feel at greater risk from Covid-19 than those on the mainland.There is also no doubt that surviving lockdown on the islands is easier than in cities such as Glasgow or London. Robertson can walk his dog for miles every day over the “machair” – the rich grasslands – and among the crofts without seeing another human being.On Benbecula, Rev Drew Kuzma has a large garden in his Church of Scotland manse and empty sandy beaches to wander with his family.“We’re fairly fortunate. My nearest neighbour is 300 yards away – if it’s windy, we can’t even hear one another,” Kuzma said. But he says he and others are cautious.“Everybody would love to see the economy return to normal. But if you had to weigh the economy against health – and given that I’d be the one to oversee the final moments of someone’s existence – I just don’t think you can compare that.”Stephen Peteranna, also on Benbecula, has more to lose from the lockdown. He runs three hotels, two of which are shut – the other remains open for essential workers, such as a refrigerator engineer who came to fix some supermarket freezers.He would support an early lifting of restrictions – he is sceptical of the claim that there have been no cases so far – but with some caveats. He said: “If there’s a national advantage to using the islands as test beds, maybe we just have to get on with that. But ending lockdown early wouldn’t mean tourists could come – and the government might end business support. I’d be really worried that staff would lose their jobs if we weren’t allowed to keep them on furlough.”There are signs of some normality returning. Hector Stewart furloughed most of his 21 staff at Kallin Shellfish five weeks ago, but last week they began fishing for lobster, crab and scallops again.“We have taken about half of our staff back on and we’re finding small markets – back to doing once- or twice-weekly trips to Glasgow,” he said. “Everybody would welcome the lockdown to be eased, but we’ve got to be careful that we don’t get the virus.”He is worried about the elderly and the relative scarcity of medical facilities, adding: “But if it can be done safely, yes, we’d support it.”Even so, there are still many questions. Who would decide if the lockdown is lifted? And how?Kuzma said: “There’s been no testing to my knowledge, and we’ve not been consulted as a population.“Although,” he added, “you get used to not being consulted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f74fe88479f1f3823ab43b86ffe2d1ff7d41c86/0_221_2962_1778/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bec7c23f81bcf4e4755e5ad6fc719f0d","title":"kim jong un reappears in north korea after weeks of speculation reports","story":"North Korean state media has released pictures purportedly showing the leader attending the opening of a fertiliser factory The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has appeared in public for the first time in almost three weeks, according to state media, following speculation that he had been seriously ill following heart surgery.The state news agency KCNA released photographs purportedly showing Kim opening a fertilizer plant in Sunchon, north of the capital Pyongyang.KCNA said Kim, accompanied by other senior officials, including his influential younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, cut a ribbon at a ceremony on Friday.What appeared to be thousands of people attending the event, many of them wearing face masks, released balloons and “broke into thunderous cheers of ‘hurrah!’ for the Supreme Leader,” the agency said.The images showed Kim smiling and talking to aides, as well as touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be immediately verified.Donald Trump, who last week suggested the mystery surrounding Kim’s absence would be solved “soon”, declined to comment on the KCNA report. “We’ll have something to say about it at the appropriate time,” he told reporters at the White House.The North Korean leader was last seen in public on 11 April when he presided over a Workers’ party politburo meeting. State media did not publish a single photograph of Kim for well over two weeks after that date, but carried reports of his daily routine, including diplomatic messages sent to other world leaders.Speculation over his whereabouts gathered pace after he missed the 15 April commemoration of the birthday of his grandfather – and North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung – which is the most important event in the country’s political calendar. It was the first time the younger Kim had missed the event since becoming leader.A day earlier, he was not present at the launch of several short-range missiles, despite having personally overseen similar launches in the past.Rumours that Kim, who succeeded his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011, was seriously unwell began with a South Korean report claiming he had undergone a “cardiovascular procedure” at Hyangsan hospital near Pyongyang on 12 April and was recuperating at a villa in nearby Mount Myohyang.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website with secret contacts in the North, claimed Kim’s health had deteriorated since last August due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork. That report was followed by claims by an unnamed US official, quoted by CNN, that Kim was “in grave danger”.Days later, 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, said it had analysed satellite images it believed showed Kim’s train parked at Wonsan, a resort on the east coast where the leader has a heavily guarded holiday home.But the office of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, said it detected no unusual signs in North Korea or any emergency reaction by its ruling party, military and cabinet. Seoul said it believed Kim was still managing state affairs but staying at an unspecified location outside Pyongyang.Defence officials in the US said there was no evidence that Kim had lost control of the country’s military.North Korean media did not offer an explanation for Kim’s absence in Saturday’s report.Last week, the South Korean unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees engagement with Pyongyang, said it was possible that Kim was taking precautions against the coronavirus outbreak.North Korea continues to claim it has not recorded a single case of Covid-19, despite sharing a border with China, where the outbreak is believed to have started.Harry Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, said the coronavirus theory was plausible.“The most likely explanation for Kim’s absence is with North Korea declaring the coronavirus pandemic an existential threat ... he most likely was taking steps to ensure his health or may have been impacted in some way personally by the virus,” Kazianis said after KCNA released the report.It is not the first time that Kim’s failure to appear in public has triggered speculation about his health.In 2014, he dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a walking stick. Days later, South Korea’s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e19c48c55b961dc42d0881403dae3f4bec073b8a/0_175_3197_1918/master/3197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01d0475711cb41a92b5138fbcec176e8","title":"uk commuters may be asked to check temperatures before travelling coronavirus","story":"Other ideas to ease lockdown reportedly include wearing face masks and a reduction from 2 to 1 metres distancingUK commuters could be asked to check their temperatures at home before travelling under plans to ease the coronavirus lockdown being considered by the government.A change in physical distancing measures, including reducing the recommended gap between people in public from 2 metres to 1 metre, is also being considered, according to reports, as Boris Johnson prepares to lay out a “roadmap” next week for schools and businesses reopening.The government has been criticised by Labour and business groups for failing to lay out a strategy for easing the lockdown, as other countries have done. It is now expected that some details will be laid out by the prime minister on Thursday, when the government reviews the current lockdown.Among the measures expected to be proposed are alterations to public transport, to enable more workplaces to open. According to a report in the Times, some of the suggestions include the distribution of hand sanitiser at bus stations and new signage to warn commuters against getting on to busy trains.Another measure is the recommendation that people using public transport wear face coverings, which the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, wants to become compulsory. Commuters may also be advised to take their temperature before leaving home. Though fever is one of the main symptoms of Covid-19, it is also possible to be contagious with the virus and not display a high temperature.A senior government source confirmed to the PA Media the plans were being looked at but stressed they were a “long way” from becoming policy.There will likely be questions over whether everyone has accurate devices to take their temperature, just as there have been concerns over the availability of respirator masks, which have been widely used in Asia to combat the spread of the virus. Temperature scanning at airports, which has been mandatory in many countries but not in the UK, may also be part of the recommendations.The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been asked to look into the feasibility of reducing the distance people must keep away from each other in public. Since the lockdown began on 24 March, people have been asked to keep 2 metres apart when outside their homes.The World Health Organization (WHO), however, advocates a distance of 1 metre while Germany has prescribed a distance of 1.5 metres. According to reports in the , Sage will report back to government on Tuesday as to whether the advice on distancing should be changed.Few alterations to the current lockdown conditions are expected on Thursday, when ideas to restart the economy and reopen schools are expected to be announced for when the government’s five tests for reducing the spread of Covid-19 have been passed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e76d0bb053db50031d3802b27d43d64993b47ea/84_0_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ec5f56bb8c4db8aff6605cdebec3c46","title":"well feel a bit more human australians welcome partial lift of coronavirus lockdown","story":"Matt and Julia can introduce baby Harvey, born 29 February, to his cousins – but they’ll play it safe with his grandparents for a few more weeksMatt Williams’s son Harvey was born five weeks earlier than expected, on a leap day, 29 February, and ever since, his aunts and uncles and cousins have been waiting to see him.Young Harvey, who is in good health, was due on 1 April, but that early arrival gave him and his family, especially the grandparents, a brief, lucky window to meet him for the first time before nearly everything closed.On Friday, New South Wales partially relaxed its restrictions so that two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household – as long as you still keep your physical distance.On Saturday, Queenslanders will be allowed to travel up to 50km for recreation, like picnics or exercise, and the national parks will be reopened. Western Australia relaxed its own laws on Monday.For Matt and his wife Julia, in Sydney, this means they can go down the road to visit his sister, and introduce Harvey to his uncle and cousins. But they’re playing it safe, and won’t be taking him to see his grandparents for at least a few weeks more.“It is a very interesting time to bring a young person in the world,” Williams says. “The current situation in some hospitals is even the father can’t go in with the birthing mothers – so we were very lucky to have missed that.For Lisa Villani, Friday’s relaxation of restrictions means she can see her friend Deb Mansfield, who is recovering from surgery.Mansfield, 43, is a visual artist and former university lecturer, who now works in the disability sector. The pair met seven years ago and, until the shutdown, worked together at a pottery workshop.“In some of my toughest times, Deb has been the family in Sydney I didn’t have. She checks in. She delivers baked goods. She sends gifts,” Villani says.A few weeks ago, Mansfield visited (from 1.5 metres away, Villani adds) and told her they had found a growth on her ovary. She went in a week later for surgery.Before the hospital visit, they had kept in touch through a virtual passata-making class. Now they can’t wait to do the same in person.“I felt so helpless at a distance, not being able to see her or support her in the lead-up to and after her surgery,” Villani says.As soon as the new rules were announced, she invited Mansfield over for dinner.In Byron Bay, Damian Brady, 39, and wife Lisa Webb, 36, say that the restrictions on gatherings have been especially hard on their young kids – who have been missing their friends.“We pulled Harry, our oldest, out of daycare as soon as the virus started spreading in Australia,” Brady says. “It’s been a month and a half since he played with another kid. It’s difficult to explain to Harry why he can’t get close to people or play on playgrounds, and all his social activities like daycare, swimming lessons and circus arts stopped cold. Thankfully our youngest is only four months old so it hasn’t affected her much.”But as parents of three children, Brady and Webb are looking forward to the break as much as for themselves as the kids.“The last time we had a catch-up with any friends for any longer than a few minutes was sometime in February,” he says.“For my wife and I, it’s just been extremely isolating. We can talk to neighbours at a distance, but for most part it’s just the four of us in a house 247. We rarely went out before things changed, but it was always an option if we needed a break.”And the family reunions will still have to wait. The pair are originally from Queensland, and the state border is still closed to people who aren’t residents or essential workers.“Most of our friends and all the grandparents are in Brisbane,” Brady says. It shows how, though the lockdowns are partially relaxed, there is still much that people can’t or aren’t quite ready to do yet.Regardless, any outing feels like a blessing.“We won’t go all out – for us it’s about extending our isolation circle just a little to feel a bit more human,” Brady says. “Harry being able to play with another kid is something I’m really looking forward to. I know he is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa524691be3e206c89ace0698932b0c2e17b12c/0_0_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60f065762d3d74dc71b6a1b19f2d3d1","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

The White House did not renew federal guidelines on social distancing that expired on 30 April, and Donald Trump is expected to go to Arizona next week, after a month without travel.Some state and local governments are opening malls, movie theatres, and hairdressers.There have also been small protests against stay-at-home orders across the country.JK Rowling is donating £1m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.Announcing the financial contribution, which will be split between the Crisis and Refuge charities, the Harry Potter author said the money would go towards helping some of those hit hardest by the outbreak and the impact of the lockdown.The author told of her mixed emotions at having three key workers in her immediate family during the crisis.In a tweet announcing the donation on Saturday, she wrote: “Today’s the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I’m going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world.“So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I’m thinking of the people who’re out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have three key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I’m torn between pride and anxiety.“As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I’ll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to Crisis, who’re helping the homeless during the pandemic, and half of which will go to Refuge, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown.”People in Spain will have to wear face masks when using public transport from Monday, the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has announced.Speaking on Saturday, as adults in Spain were allowed out to exercise for the first time since the strict lockdown was imposed on 14 March, the prime minister said the use of masks would be compulsory on buses, tubes and trains.Sánchez said 6m masks would be handed out at transport hubs, 7m would be issued by councils, and 1.5m would be distributed by the Red Cross and other NGOs.He also announced that the government would seek MPs’ approval next week for another two-week extension of the state of emergency, which is currently due to end on 10 May.He said that the success of Spain’s phased emergence from lockdown would depend on “social and personal responsibility”, adding: “The key to the de-escalation isn’t just about personal decisions. The key will be tens of thousands of decisions taken at home, on public transport, at work, and in free time.”According to the latest health ministry figures, there have been 216,582 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain, and 25,100 deaths. Japan will fasttrack a review of the antiviral drug remdesivir so that it can hopefully be approved for domestic Covid-19 patients a week after Gilead Sciences filing for such approval, the health minister said on Saturday, according to a report by Reuters.

The R number, which is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread, is below 1 according to a health official.“The R-factor is below 1 and we want to keep it that way,” said Charmaine Gauci, superintendent of public health. “We have now started easing measures, including the opening of non-essential retail outlets.

On Wednesday, the government released figures that revealed coronavirus deaths for both in hospitals and the community, including care homes, for the first time. It added an additional 3,811 deaths for those who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the community since the start of the outbreak, bringing the total number of deaths to more than 26,000.Mick Jagger and Will Smith will be among dozens of international celebrities performing from their homes in a four-hour concert to raise funds for the battle against coronavirus in India, where the number of cases is surging.The country’s cricket captain Virat Kohli, Bollywood actors Priyanka Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan are some of the top domestic names billed to perform or read messages during the event on Sunday.The performances will be livestreamed by Facebook and will pay tribute to workers fighting the pandemic.A trial has begun in the UK to test if blood plasma from coronavirus survivors could help treat those critically ill with the disease.Plasma is a clear liquid that makes up about half of people’s blood volume and carries red and white blood cells and platelets around the body.

In her letter to the health secretary, she said: Increasingly, NHS staff are breaking down - I see it first-hand working shifts.From a fear of spreading the virus to patients and loved ones, a lack of PPE, an increased workload owing to the number of cases and staff absences, to being redeployed to ICUs and witnessing more patients die, staff are experiencing greater pressure, which is inevitably taking its toll on their mental health.At this time of crisis, staff mental health must be a priority now. It simply cannot be an afterthought once the acute stage of the crisis is over.Lifting lockdown measures in two weeks would result in a second wave of infection comparable to leaving them in place until the summer, according to a new study by mathematicians at the University of Sussex.The findings, which run contrary to lessons many have drawn from the recent period of lockdown across the world, have been published on medRxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed.The research was based on modelling that looked at “non-exponential distribution of incubation and recovery periods”, as well as the age structure of a given population. It found that changing the length of a lockdown – from eight to 12 or 16 weeks – would have an impact on the date at which any second wave might arrive, but only a marginal effect on the number of cases or deaths.Another finding in the report claimed that the later a second period of lockdown was introduced – one that lasted for eight weeks – the bigger the reduction in any cases would be, compared to taking no lockdown action at all.Communities with a younger average age of population would also extract greater benefit from a longer period of lockdown than one with an older population, according to the study. It found that any lockdown would save more lives amongst a younger community than an older one.Dr Konstantin Blyuss, Reader in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: Although in each case we explored, there will be a second epidemic peak after the quarantine is lifted, interestingly and quite counterintuitively, the later quarantine is introduced, the smaller this second peak will be. This reduction becomes quite substantial for quarantines introduced at a later stage.Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the report, said the expanded effects of lockdown on young people could be explained by the likelihood of their being more socially mobile. She said:A bigger impact of quarantine on reducing deaths in regions with younger populations can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the fact that younger people have more contacts and thus are making a bigger contribution to disease transmission, so quarantining them makes a bigger impact on reducing the overall disease burden.The artist Jeremy Deller has called on middle-aged ravers to buy a poster he has produced in recognition of the plight of victims of domestic violence and care home residents during the coronavirus pandemic.Sales of the print, which says Bless this Acid House, will support Refuge, a charity for survivors of domestic abuse, and Pilgrims’ Friend Society, which runs care homes across the UK.One of Deller’s most famous artworks, Acid Brass, saw him collaborate with a brass band that performed 1980s acid house classics such as A Guy Called Gerald’s Voodoo Ray.Graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge, who co-produced the posters, said he and Deller wanted to support charities “under increased pressure during this time and to bring a bit of joy into people’s homes and windows”.Last month, the pair published a poster called Thank God For Immigrants, which raised £50,000 for food bank charity the Trussell Trust and Refugee Action, which supports asylum seekers.This is from ITV’s Daniel Hewitt.He previously reported that hospices were set to run out of PPE “within days” because providers of end-of-life care were being denied access to government supplies.My colleague Aamna Mohdin has written about how coronavirus has hit the borough of Newham – one of the country’s most deprived areas – harder than anywhere else. The east London borough has recorded the worst mortality rate in England and Wales.The borough’s rate – 144.3 deaths per 100,000 people – is closely followed by Brent in north London (141.5), and Newham’s neighbour Hackney (127.4), according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics. The data confirms what had already been suspected: people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying from Covid-19 at a much higher rate than those in the richest.Newham resident Kamul Islam, a 40-year-old cab driver, said 22 people had died aftering contracting the virus on his road and neighbouring street alone. He said: Every day I get a message from someone in my community telling me of people who have died. They are young and old. It’s been really tough."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243778.1588417122!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cancel the leaving cert fianna f%C3%A1il says uncertainty causing stress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Leaving Cert must be cancelled, according to Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman. Photograph: Frank MillerFileDuring his television address unveiling the plan Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said schools and colleges would not reopen until SeptemberOctober for the start of the new academic year.He did not offer additional details, but education sources say this likely means a later start to the academic year in most cases. On the Late Late Show, Mr Varadkar said it was still “the plan” to start the Leaving Cert on July 29th.The absence of a reference to the exams in the Government’s roadmap for easing restrictions has been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of fresh uncertainty over whether they will go ahead.However, a spokesman for the Department of Education said the Government is still planning to proceed with two weeks of school in July for Leaving Cert students, ahead of the scheduled start of the exams on July 29th.“Planning for the Leaving Cert is still being discussed, including through the advisory group set up by the department involving education stakeholders. It is still hoped to bring just Leaving Cert students back in July, subject to adequate planning and public health advice,” the spokesman said.However, Mr Byrne said in a statement on Saturday: “This document contains details about the phased reopening of certain sectors and industry, and sets out dates for the proposed lifting of certain restrictions but not once is the Leaving Cert mentioned. I believe this is a huge oversight and it has added to the already heightened anxiety among Leaving Cert students.He said it was unfair to underestimate the stress students are feeling as the uncertainty about their exams. “I believe the Government cannot continue to adopt this wait and see approach with the Leaving Cert. It is becoming clearer with every week that passes that it is simply not tenable for it to proceed.”Mr Byrne said he had discussed alternatives with some universities and with Mr McHugh, adding: “They do exist and we must now switch our focus to them. The current situation is unacceptable and unfair and is causing untold psychological damage to these students.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236007.1587640578!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"david attenborough gives humankind one last chance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGoat willow in flower. Illustration: Michael VineyRocking in my rocking chair – which is what they’re for – I looked out through the branches of the big willow tree and there, framed in a distant triangle of twigs, our neighbour’s children were out-rocking me on their garden swings.On the television in the corner, Andrew Marr was quizzing David Attenborough about his latest, perhaps his last, and undoubtedly his most passionate film, A Life on Our Planet. It frames his view of humankind’s “last chance” at living on Earth.“Our lot,” said Attenborough (93), “are finished anyway. “It’s up to the young to do things better.” “Some people,” Marr offered, “think that Covid-19 could be the reckoning the human world deserves.” Attenborough backed off from anything so biblical. He countered merely that a densely living, overpopulated species was much more susceptible to plagues.His film, soon for Netflix, is apparently a properly terrifying catalogue of what we’ve been doing to the natural world. For all the years of brilliant films exploring and celebrating nature, he or his producers were slow to invite much public outrage about the darker destructions.Attenborough’s recent Blue Planet II, with its nightmare of plastic in the ocean, was the one that really touched some anger. What, Marr asked, was the one bit of change that ordinary people could effect. “Waste!” was Attenborough’s explosive reply.Veteran willowA breeze stirred the willow twigs and their first fringe of green. As the old tree drops her catkins, flushing fully into life, I’ll lose the playing children, along with the view of the mountain and the rising of the moon.It’s quite a veteran as willows go, couched in the stream’s ravine, its elbows propped on the banks. Nowhere else on the hillside could it possibly exist, so safe from people, from sheep and the worst of storms.But willows are everywhere on this soggy island – at least 18 kinds that botanists can ine, often with some difficulty. A tree that reached here naturally in perhaps six or seven forms has been added to by garden introductions and multiple hybridisations.If we had to choose one as the national tree (as I think it richly deserves), it should probably be the common “goat” or “pussy’ willow, Salix caprea. Like the one in my painting, it is ablaze with yellow catkins in early spring. The “goat” stems from an early role as fodder, and the flowers still offer nectar to bumblebee queens fresh out from hibernation. In the sort of little cameo captured by many readers alert to events in their gardens, Paul Dunne, of Lettermore in Co Galway, sent a photograph of ants perched on willow catkins and wondered how unusual this was.They had climbed the tree, he surmised, for pollen or nectar. But the ascent of ants on willows, in particular, is a well-known phenomenon. The ants’ attraction is more usually for aphids, or rather, the sweet liquid known as “honeydew” exuding from their fundaments.This sugary waste is extruded from the aphids’ extraction of sap in the willow’s youngest, most tender, shoots. Googling “ants on willows” offers a graphic Flickr close-up of ants in close attendance.No aphids appear on Dunne’s catkins, but bluetits I see foraging along flowering twigs of our own willow confirm that they abound. A score or more of different species suck at the shoots of sallies in these islands, and since the salicin in willows converts to salicylic acid, a natural aspirin, one may wonder if both aphids and ants are seeking to be spaced out.Of far more urgent consequence in the appetite of aphids is that of the grain aphid, Sitobion avanae. It sucks at the sap of spring-sown barley seedlings, barely greening the field, and flies around to spread the dreaded “yellow dwarf virus”. It is also evolving resistance to pyrethroids, the chemical ingredients of most modern pesticides.Teagasc, the farmers’ oracle, has long encouraged “integrated pest management”. Its advice at the national tillage conference in January was to sow early and spray once “if warranted”.Several sparrowsFor better news, my recent column on the reported decline of urban house sparrows brought many reassuring emails from readers with abundant chirping residents. This ties in well with the latest Big Garden Watch survey of the UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. From returns by nearly half a million people in late January, the house sparrow was the most commonly seen (or, perhaps, readily recognised) garden bird. With new mild winters to help survival, the society hopes “that at least a partial recovery may be happening”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243032.1588358511!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"call for precarious contracts of frontline nurses to be clarified","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn INMO spokesman said the organisation had not known nurses returning to the frontline in recent weeks, under the On Call for Ireland drive, were agency workers on short-term contracts. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw  The The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) is seeking “urgent clarification” on the employment rights of hundreds of nurses recruited to help in the Covid-19 pandemic, after it emerged none recruited under the Be On Call for Ireland drive, is working directly for the HSE.The executive confirmed on Friday many new recruits to the frontline in recent weeks are agency staff on short-term contracts. An INMO spokesman said the organisation had been aware of this. “We are concerned and are seeking urgent clarification of what’s going on,” he said but would not comment further.A nurse, working in a Dublin hospital since last week, was “really disappointed” when she got her contract of employment on Tuesday, that it was not with the HSE. It was “precarious and short-term”, she said. She had responded to the HSE’s Be On Call For Ireland campaign after almost five years out of nursing, “because morally it was the right thing to do”.Her contract, dated April 28th and seen by The , is for three months and states she will not be entitled to paid sick leave or compassionate leave. She has an ill, elderly mother. She has a “Specified Purpose Contract of Employment between CPL Healthcare Limited” and her. The HSE is described as “the client”. Her employment “with the company…shall be for the purpose of working to help the client during this emergency period as a result of the outbreak of Covid-19. The employment under the terms of this contract will terminate at the end of the emergency period of the Covid-19”.“It is anticipated that the duration of the assignment will be approximately three months,” though this may change, it says.“There is no obligation on the company to provide you with work and there is no obligation on you to accept the work offered…The company gives no guarantee that hours will be offered to you on a weekly basis.“Unless otherwise agreed, you will not be entitled to payment either from the company or the client in respect of time not spent on assignment, whether as a result of illness or absence for any other reason with the exception of annual leave or public holidays.”It states: “From time to time, you may be required to change location(s)wards at which you provide the services subject to the client’s requirements.”The young woman, who qualified as a nurse in 2012 during the HSE recruitment embargo, worked as an agency nurse for three years but left as the cost of childcare made working unviable. “I really was under the impression the HSE was recruiting and employing extra nurses in a new single-tier health service.” She cites statements in recent weeks by Minister for Health Simon Harris, and chief executive of the HSE Paul Reid, in which both said the HSE wanted to hire as many health professionals as possible. She is concerned about being moved between hospitals, saying this is “unsafe and unfair on staff in those hospitals to have to re-orientate agency workers repeatedly”.“I really feel for all those nurses and doctors who were asked to come home to work in the Irish public health service and all they get are these precarious, short-term contracts.”Richard Boyd Barrett, TD (People Before Profit) raised the agency employment issue at Taoiseach’s questions on Thursday, asking why the new workers had been “given the worst possible contracts”.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “That is new information to me so I will have to check up on it.” A HSE spokeswoman said: “The Be on Call for Ireland campaign is an initiative supported by CPL Recruitment agency.“Due to the strain on existing HSE resources to meet the COVID- 19 challenge, the HSE is being supported by an employment agency in increasing the available workforce for a short term period. The contract of employment will be to an employment agency and will not be a HSE contract at this point. Employment contracts may be reviewed at a later date.“Be on Call for Ireland appointees are paid the same salaries as HSE employees,” she said adding anyone who becomes ill with Covid-19 is entitled to the Covid illness benefit from the Department of Social Protection.CPL Healthcare did not respond to requests for a comment, made by email and phone.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Otherwise all restrictions will remain in place.Mr Varadkar said that on May 18th, should progress in containing the virus continue in the intervening two weeks, then the restrictions will be eased in a series of five stages, three weeks apart. “Our plan is to re-open the country in a slow, staged, phased way,” Mr Varadkar said.On May 18th, some retail outlets such as garden centres and DIY centres will be allowed open, some outdoor sports will be allowed and small groups of family and friends will be permitted to meet in the open. Construction and outdoor work will restart.In later phases, other businesses will be allowed reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.However, Mr Varadkar warned that the easing of the restrictions will depend on there being no “second wave” of the virus which could overwhelm health services.“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” he said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.“In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolate if they are sick.”Micheál Martin said he agreed with the cautious advice of the public health officials but called for clarity about the leaving certificate.Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “essential” to have a roadmap for the reopening of Ireland, and said that the testing capacity needed to be improved to allow for the lockdown to be lifted.In a televised address on Friday, Mr Varadkar said thousands of lives have been saved “because of the sacrifices and choice you have made”.“When we come through this, we will come together as a nation and grieve for everyone who has died over the course of this emergency,” he said.But he warned that the phases of reopening the country may have to be reversed back a step, if the rate of the infection increases significantly as the lockdown is eased.“We need two more weeks of tight restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said, so the virus does not have a chance to make a “comeback”.The curve has been flattened but “we have not yet won this fight”, he said.“I know for me the worst part has been the daily text message I receive at around 5 o’clock every evening of the number of deaths, and number of new cases,” the Taoiseach said. “I yearn for the day it stops.”The Full PlanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin re-opening from May 18th under a roadmap which contains five phases.The first phase begins on May 18thIn this early stage, up to four people not of the same household will be able to meet outdoors while maintaining strict social distancing. Funerals will still be a maximum of ten people. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working on allotments. But remote working will remain in place for the vast majority of businesses. Garden centres and hardware stores can reopen as well as opticians, bike repairs and phone repairs.Electrical outlets may open\u0026nbspTennis courts and golf courses can reopen but social distancing will apply. Outdoor public amenities and tourism sites may open. A maximum of four people can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities. Schools and college buildings will be opened to allow teachers to organise remote learning.The second phase begins on June 8thIn this phase, people will now be permitted to travel up to 20km but will be advised to avoid all unnecessary journeys. Over 70s will be allowed to shop at specific hours. Visits to homes of over 70s will be permitted by no more than a few people for a short period of time and they must wear gloves, face coverings, maintaining strict 2m social distancing.For everyone else, up to four people may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing. In terms of funerals, slightly larger numbers of people can be in attendance at funerals but they will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends.There will be a “phased return” of other workers who can maintain a distance from others of two metres at all times.\u0026nbspBusinesses that can maintain remote working will be asked to do so. Small retail outlets, with a small number of staff, and open marts could also\u0026nbspreopen.Libraries can open with limited numbers. People can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities where there is a small group team but this does not include matches.The third phase begins on June 29thTravel restrictions will remain at 20km. Cafes and restaurants that can adhere to social distancing guidelines will reopen. Creches will be reopened but only for the children of essential workers. Hospital and prison visits may resume but consideration will have to be given to the availability of PPE in each unit.Businesses will be asked to continue with remote working where possible but organisations where employees have a low level of daily interaction may return. There will be a phased reopening of non-essential retail outlets on the basis of restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. This will be limited to retail outlets with street-level entrance and exit i.e. which are not in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk.Playgrounds will be reopened where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. Some “behind closed doors” sporting activities will be permitted. Public transport will remain restricted. The Government will consider implementing travel restrictions on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres.The fourth phase begins on July 20thIn this phase, people can now travel outside their region. A slightly larger number of people (more than four, but the exact number has not yet been specified)\u0026nbspmay visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. The same will apply to other social gatherings outside of family and friends.Creches for all other workers will reopen but only for one a day a week to start with. Businesses will be asked to stagger work hours but Government will ask that remote working will continue. Hairdressers and barbers may reopen as well as museums, galleries, religious places of worship. Hotels and hostels will reopen on limited occupancy. Hotel bars will remain closed. Caravan and holiday parks may reopen. Restrictions on the numbers allowed to travel into urban centres will be decreased on public transport.The last phase begins on August 10thPubs, bars, nightclubs and casinos will reopen where social distancing and cleaning can be complied with. Festivals and other cultural gatherings may be held but with restricted numbers. Large weddings will still be restricted due to risk, as will other large gatherings. Normal visiting will resume in hospitals.A phased return to normal work will start around this time. Shopping centres will reopen as well as theatres and cinemas that can maintain social distancing. Close physical contact sports like rugby, boxing and wrestling will be permitted. Gyms can reopen where there is regular and effective cleaning.Sports spectatorship which involves mass gatherings will be permitted, but only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions. Indoor recreational venues like roller skating, bowling alleys and bingo halls may open where numbers can be limited. High-risk organisations which cannot maintain social distancing will be asked to implement plans for how they can eventually return to full complement. Some time after this period, schools will reopen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Col Ringrose, who has died aged 89, described as an \u0026lsquoexemplary ambassador\u0026rsquo for IrelandGarda\u0026iacute looking for help in finding Reece Atkinson from MonasterboiceGarda\u0026iacute discover drugs after stopping motorist in Raheny on Friday eveningVaradkar says new government can be formed by JuneConcern over employment rights of hundreds of people recruited to fight Covid-19With fewer sittings due to lockdown, judges \u0026lsquoeat into\u0026rsquo list of reserved judgmentsHSE says there has been \u0026lsquoconcerted effort\u0026rsquo to encourage public to continue to contact their GP with non-Covid related symptomsTaoiseach warns restrictions will be reimposed in event of coronavirus \u0026lsquosecond wave\u0026rsquoHSE in talks to resolve impasse over plans for private consultants to treat public patientsFour motorbikes suspected to have been used in transportation of drugs seizedWidespread testing was undertaken at the centre in Cahersiveen last weekWhat will happen and when will it happen?Chief Medical Officer says guidance being developed as part of restriction easingPat Clavin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquooperational and professional standards experience will be of immense benefit\u0026rsquo Harris saysDublin and Stormont should come together to plot way forward, says Colm EastwoodThe Irish Travel Agents Association said airlines are not refunding flights to membersAlmost 50 per cent increase in calls to mental health charity since beginning of Covid-19Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243161.1588368725!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord another soliloquy on merrion street but there was a daring twist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThis time Leo addressed the nation from the bottom of the stairs.  And he skipped the poetry. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandThere was something missing in the polished cameo shot with the camera trained on Leo alone. And it wasn’t the poetry.It was the slogan.Even though it wasn’t there, we could see it in the mind’s eye as a Taoiseach in possession of no government showcased his statesmanship in front of an audience of the people. There, in neat general election letters, above his head.This was what Friday evening’s big speech was all about. Complete with a roadmap and the unided attention of a worried nation anxious for guidance and reassurance.Varadkar delivered this in the process of confirming his Government’s comprehensively leaked decision that the Covid-19 restrictions are to continue for two more weeks, with just a few minor changes. However, there is a plan to gradually unwind the shutdown in a series of stages, in a sensible way.Hard to argue with that.“Reopening Ireland”. From the people who brought you “Project Ireland”.They know their way around a plan they have managed the lockdown very competently and now seem best poised to unwind it. Leo Varadkar sold it very well during his latest address to the nation.If he can deliver on the roadmap, and the shaky-looking government formation talks hit the buffers, it could be just the ticket to a new term.This speech marked a radical departure by the Taoiseach.Yes, he was still front and centre in the grandeur of Government Buildings, with the showy accoutrements of State positioned around him. Still standing tall in the middle of the picture looking all handsome and leaderly.But here’s the daring twist: this time Leo addressed the nation from the bottom of the stairs. Last time, he impressed us hugely from the Serious Corridor upstairs.High-fives all round for smarts.Of course, the absence of poetry was noted. Did ideas man John Concannon accidentally drop The Heaney Book down the back of a radiator? Or maybe the speechwriter was still sulking because Labour’s Alan Kelly quoted Eavan Boland, who died this week, in the Dáil on Thursday, thus stealing a march.Whatever. This was of no real interest to working journalists, who hung around Leinster House all day wondering when they would be informed of a time and place for the unveiling by the Taoiseach of his much-trailed Covid Lockdown Exit. They really wanted to ask him questions about it.But they couldn’t because Leo’s people decided it was time for another Soliloquy on Merrion Street. At least the hacks were able to recite most of the lines along with him because they were comprehensively leaked well before he opened his mouth.Although, to be fair, the Taoiseach would be going on The Late Late Show a few hours later, there to be eviscerated by Ryan Tubridy along with the other light entertainment acts offering themselves up for Friday night slaughter. And you can’t say braver than that.The unwinding will take part in five stages at three-week intervals. Here, the Taoiseach signalled the numbers by quickly unfurling his fingers, just like the host of an old, incomprehensible game show called 3-2-1, in which the co-star was “Dusty Bin”.The biggest news from Government Buildings was that “the over-70s will be allowed out”. What happens after that is anybody’s guess. They might wreck the gaff. Just as well the pubs will remain closed. Along with DIY shops and garden centres, which will have to wait a few weeks longer while the big supermarkets buy in new stock and take all their business.We hear the Taoiseach and members of his cabinet were overjoyed when told the exit strategy would involve “five stages” and there was terrible disappointment when the news was broken that these were not actual stages, for performance purposes.It’ll be more like Tour de France stages: gruelling, but ultimately exhilarating.People will be able to exert themselves now over five kilometres, instead of confining themselves to two. This means they will be able to lie less to gardaí, which will remove a lot of stress.Two more weeks of tight restrictions should be doable, when the outcome means the safety of family members and fellow citizens.“Not long from now, some summer night, we will see our friends again,” mused Leo, waxing slightly poetic. Wistfully.He mentioned the “10,000” or so letters he has received in recent weeks. Who knew so many people feel compelled to write to the Taoiseach with their thoughts and dreams and problems and desires?Tight restrictions? We know all about them after weeks of flattening the curve. Another two shouldn’t make much difference at this stage when the future looks elastic.Never mind. The Fianna Fáil leader, stuck in the Leinster House carpark, mentioned them. Leo stole his thunder in every other department – it’s difficult for Micheál to stay relevant. Micheál’s backdrop was of the railings in front of the National Library and a fella wheeling his bicycle past the camera. Not a patch on the flags and pillars and marble staircase of Government Buildings.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald was also canvassed for her opinion on TV after the Taoiseach’s performance. Her backdrop was even gloomier, in a darkened room in front of a black-and-white portrait of Countess Markievicz.Meanwhile, the man in possession of no government but still firmly in charge told the nation that their effort so far “has been worthwhile. It is working. So let’s finish what we started.”The good days will come again, promised Leo.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242928.1588346815!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the animals are baffled at dublin zoo what happened the humans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPink flamingos stand silently  in their enclosure at a closed Dublin Zoo.

They are watched by a pride of biblical lions lounging at the front of their enclosure, while the macaques nearby throw fresh straw at each other as tigers prowl, alert to every move made by the handful of people who pass them each day.The elephant family does its own thing, as it always has done.More than six weeks ago the zoo – which is among the top tourist attractions in Ireland with over 1.2 million visitors annually – closed its doors to all but a core team of socially distanced zookeepers working in strictly controlled groups to combat infection.They are watched over by zoo director Leo Oosterweghel. He has been at the helm of Dublin Zoo for almost 20 years, and never once imagined he would see days like this. His home is the zoo, and he is the person best placed to record how the absence of people has impacted on the animals he cares for.“They look at me with more surprise now,” he says. “They come up and have a good look because they’re wondering what’s happened to everyone else. They are used to visitors.”Before the zoo closed it employed over 100 people – only 40 remain.“Most of our people have been laid off,” the director says. “All we have now is the animal care team and some support staff. We had to let so many people go and that has been extremely difficult. It is hard to tell someone they are non-essential because we are such a close-knit team here.”EntertainmentDublin Zoo was first conceived in the Rotunda Hospital in 1830 by a group of medics with a view to providing entertainment for well-heeled Dubliners and easy access to animal corpses for doctors. Once animals – specially the primates – had outlived their usefulness as spectacles their cadavers were prized for research purposes.It could scarcely be more different now. Today the animals always come first. The zoo’s main focus is their welfare and conservation, and much of the money it raises each year funds projects across the world aimed at protecting endangered species in the wild and developing critical breeding programmes in captivity.“We have had to slow down our conservation efforts because every euro counts. And that breaks your heart,” says Oosterweghel.But there are steps he will never take no matter how difficult things get.“I have heard of some zoos talking of animal euthanasia to reduce their costs, but that is never going to happen here, not on my watch. It is not even discussed.“We have all of the costs and none of the revenue,” he says.The food bill alone is close to €10,000 a week, added to which is the cost of wages for the essential staff. As a self-funding charity, the zoo gets no aid from the State but Oosterweghel says the zoo may need a “bridging loan” in the weeks ahead.60 acresWhile times are bleak, the zoo perhaps has an advantage over many attractions as it is outdoors and spread over 60 acres of the Phoenix Park. Yet even so social distancing in the future will have to be carefully managed. “We don’t know when we will reopen or what we might look like when we do,” he admits.He has given up speculating as to when that day might come. “It all depends on what the Government tells us to do, and when we can do it.”Just as it is beyond the zoo’s high fences, health is of utmost concern.“The virus is very much on our radar, and we have sharpened our protocols. From the start the zookeepers looking after primates wore mask because we knew there could be cross-transmission . They now wear masks when looking after the cats too.”That happened after it emerged in early April that a tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo had tested positive for Covid-19 after contracting it from a caretaker who was asymptomatic at the time.As Oosterweghel talks and walks, the pink flamingos stand silently on little islands in their enclosure. Then one sees humans and starts squawking. Soon it is joined by dozens of excited others. Once the humans turn a corner, the flamingos fall silent again.Around that turned corner the sea lions are putting on a show for zookeeper Daniel Dunne. His job in recent weeks has been to “ensure that they are stimulated and exercised and fed and taken care of”. He also makes sure their habitat is in pristine condition.Like all the zookeepers he has been working in a small team with no interaction with others. He admits that it has become a little lonely.Nearby the tigers are having lunch at the front of their enclosure, seemingly unconcerned or even aware of the presence of people. But when we turn to walk away one of them is upon us in an instant, only inches away and separated by some thankfully thick glass. “You turned your back and their instinct is to go after you as prey,” Oosterweghel says.They don’t go after him, though. They high-five him instead. He casually places the palm of one hand on the glass and one of the great cats immediately responds by rising up on hind legs and putting a giant front paw in the director’s hand – or as close to it as the glass allows. The bond is impossible to miss.Super-smartMel Sheridan is minding the elephants as they mind their own business“I don’t doubt for a second that they have noticed that the humans are not around because they are super-smart and nothing gets passed them,” she says. “But they are just so focused on their own family unit, and they just want to eat and play and roll in the mud, so they’re okay.”As we walk away she shouts after us “it’s nice for us to see other people though”. She sounds lonely too.Oosterweghel walks past the zoo’s farm. A cow approaches him for a nuzzle, a sheep looks on with jealousy in her eyes.“It is so quiet now,” he says sadly. “You can really take your time walking around looking at the animals. But unfortunately we cannot share it.”Not now, perhaps, but soon.

Video: The Late Late Show  RTE\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar appeared on the Late Late Show on Friday night. Photograph: RTÉTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he thinks there can be a new government formed by June.Speaking on The Late Late Show on Friday night, Mr Varadkar said: “The country actually needs it. . . The current Government is functioning well at the moment, but cannot go on like this forever. We are making decisions at the moment without a parliamentary mandate.”Mr Varadkar said he was “very keen” to meet the Green Party’s demand for a 7 per cent a year target for reducing carbon emissions. He acknowledged there are many farmers who will worry about what that might mean for them but added: “We need to see more ambitious climate action as an opportunity - to remake agriculture, to give much better and secure income to our farmers, creating lots of jobs, becoming a net exporter of energy . . . Climate action can be a big economic success story for Ireland. ”His comment comes after the Green Party held its third round of discussions on government formation. Speaking to host Ryan Tubridy, Mr Varadkar said he hoped the Green Party was “coming to a point where they would enter talks” but said: “Even if we do agree on a programme for government, most of the parties, including my own, have to get it ratified by our membership.”Asked why he would not consider a coalition with Sinn Féin, Mr Varadkar said he was remaining true to his word given during the election. “Sometimes in politics, you have to go back on your word because of circumstances outside of your control. This isn’t one of those occasions,” he said.Speaking in relation to the Government’s announcement that the current restrictions regarding the coronavirus pandemic will be extended until May 18th, Mr Varadkar said he would have liked to have eased restrictions further but it was not possible as the virus “isn’t suppressed enough”.Mr Varadkar said Ireland is “going slower than other countries” in order to avoid “going backwards” but said there are elements in the later phases of the roadmap published on Friday that could potentially be brought forward.Mr Varadkar indicated unemployment supports and wage subsidies put in place due to coronavirus could be extended as it “wouldn’t be right to unwind it before those sectors reopen . . . when people have the opportunity at least to go back to work”. However, he said the supports cannot last forever.Asked about the trend of fatalities in nursing homes around the country, the Taoiseach said: “When all of this is over . . . we’ll find things that could have been done differently, better or not done at all”. He said it would have been “much better if we’d been able to do testing earlier but the capacity wasn’t there”.The Taoiseach suggested the possibility of the 2020 All-Ireland football and hurling championships going ahead behind closed doors this year and confirmed it was still the plan to have the Leaving Certificate examinations go ahead from July 29th.The reopening of the country could be more difficult than shutting it down, the Taoiseach said. “There are going to be difficulties, rows and disputes . . . But I think we can do it.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"United Nations warns authorities against detaining people in overcrowded centresNorth Korean leader reportedly attends event after speculation about healthChen Jieren has been detained since 2018 after he published two blog articles claiming corruption by Hunan party officialsRescheduled general assembly to take place next month against backdrop of coronavirusHundreds of firefighters tackle blaze in new warehouse in city of IncheonBeijing mounting \u0026lsquono-holds-barred\u0026rsquo diplomatic effort to stem growing calls for compensationReports of North Korean leader\u0026rsquos illness expose limits of foreign insight into countryPM says it will be weeks before movement restrictions lifted and some could be reintroducedKim Yo-jong was a favourite of her late father and is reported to have been groomed for the roleLockdown restrictions eased as community transmission eliminated, but Ardern warns fight not over\u0026lsquoNo suspicious movements\u0026rsquo detected in North Korea as conjecture grows over leader\u0026rsquos absenceWhile the number of new coronavirus cases has begun to fall, experts say the rate of change is not as fast as expectedIn recent years China has sought to expand its control over the region by building artificial islands around reefs and atollsSouth Korea reiterates that it has detected \u0026lsquonothing unusual\u0026rsquo in the NorthSecondary school students told to arrive early for temperature checksContribution comes days after Washington said the US would freeze funding to WHOHardline clerics calling the shots and urging devotees to ignore anti-pandemic measuresLatest cases raise concern about potential impact on Nagasaki residentsSouth Korea\u0026rsquos presidential Blue House says no unusual signs coming from neighbourLeatherbacks are world\u0026rsquos largest sea turtles and are endangered in ThailandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243758.1588408781!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kim jong un reappears after weeks of absence state media","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA photo released by the official North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attending a completion ceremony of a factory. Photograph: EPAKCNAAfter weeks of intense speculation about the health of Kim Jong-un, state news agency KCNA said on Saturday the North Korean leader attended the completion of a fertilisers plant north of Pyongyang, the first report of his appearance since April 11th.Reuters could not independently verify the KCNA report.KCNA said Mr Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony on Friday and those attending the event “burst into thunderous cheers of ‘hurrah!’ for the Supreme Leader...”Mr Kim was seen in photographs smiling and talking to aides at the ribbon-cutting ceremony and also touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.Many in the large crowd of people, described as officials of the army, the ruling party and the community who worked on the project, were wearing face masks and standing some distance from the podium where Mr Kim and his aides took part in the ceremony.North Korea has not reported any cases of the coronavirus and has said it has been taking tough measures to prevent an outbreak. One reason for Mr Kim’s absence has been the suggestion he may have been taking precautions against coronavirus.Mr Kim was accompanied by senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yojong and top aides vice-chairman Pak Pong-ju of the State Affairs Commission and cabinet premier Kim Jae-ryong, and KCNA said.Asked about the KCNA report on Mr Kim, US president Donald Trump said: “I’d rather not comment on it yet.”“We’ll have something to say about it at the appropriate time,” he told reporters at the White House.Speculation about Mr Kim’s health has been rife after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il-sung on April 15th. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Mr Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state.He last made a public appearance on April 11th attending a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party politburo.Following his absence from the anniversary, a South Korean news outlet specialising on the North reported that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure. A flurry of other unconfirmed reports about his condition and his whereabouts followed.Officials in South Korea and the United States expressed scepticism about the reports.State TV footage on Saturday showed Mr Kim’s leg movements appearing stiff and jerky and one of the images showed a green golf cart in the background, similar to one he used in 2014 after a lengthy public absence.“Preparing desks and chairs on the stage seemed a bit rare for such an outdoor occasion,” Nam Seong-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University, said of the ceremony.“Kim might have some physical conditions that prevent him from standing too long and he needs to be seated after standing up for awhile.”Prof Nam said if Mr Kim is unable to stand for long periods that maybe the reason he did not attend the anniversary event in April at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where he would have had to stand for at least about an hour.The city of Sunchon where the fertiliser factory was built is about 50km (30 miles) north of Pyongyang in the western region, away from Wonsan, the eastern coastal resort where South Korean and US officials have said Mr Kim may have been staying.Satellite images showing a train usually used by Mr Kim near the Wonsan resort, as well as boats often used by Mr Kim and his entourage, suggested he may be staying there.Officials in South Korea and the United States have said Mr Kim may be there to avoid exposure to the coronavirus, and have expressed scepticism about media reports that he had some kind of serious illness.–ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/10/TELEMMGLPICT000227462106_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHFpKXeXCxMIMJz8yhX7SwjhqJjatWbAoPNpik4CultM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hesitating demand international inquiry china","story":"Xi Jinping presides over a system of governmental, scientific and intellectual control whose secretiveness and mendacity have created the most sudden and widespread health crisis in historyAustralia has called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. Not unreasonable, you might think. The virus was made in China. It has now put paid to the prosperity of almost everyone. We would like to know why it happened.Then, on Thursday, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, an Australian businessman, gave a press conference in Melbourne with the Australian health minister. He announced his procurement of £5 million-worth of Covid-19 testing kits from China. Twiggy is a billionaire because his business, part-owned by, and overwhelmingly dependent on, China, supplies it with iron ore. Without warning the health minister, Twiggy invited the Chinese consul-general to speak at the same press conference.The consul-general praised China’s “open, transparent and responsible manner” over Covid-19, adding sweetly: “This project is another testimony of the friendship and the co-operation between our two countries and the two peoples ... the virus knows no ideology, border or race … we’re all in this together.” The minister had been set up by his fellow-countryman and by China.This sequence epitomises the Chinese Communist Party in its dealings with the West in the era of Xi Jinping. Here is the blatant, brutal threat. Here is the almost equally blatant trick which seems to offer the hand of friendship. And here, I regret to say, is the third key component – a Western prominente who, for reasons of self-interest, takes China’s part.In the old days, Communist regimes devoted great energy to winning converts in the West. The Soviet Union succeeded in recruiting some actual traitors and infiltrating trade unions. At the height of Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution in the Sixties, students were deluged with copies of his Little Red Book. Such propaganda had some effect: absolutism always attracts some people. But these efforts were what we nowadays call “clunky”. The Communists – especially the Chinese – were too cut off from us culturally. They were also very short of money.From the late Seventies, that began to change. By the 21st century, Chinese influence had become, one might say, pandemic. China opened up to the West and vice versa. People and businesses approved by the Chinese Communist Party started to come here in serious quantities – for tourism, study, investment, houses in Belgravia. There were many benefits for both sides. Many Western countries, however, suspended any sense of strategic vigilance. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, our government scrambled for contracts. Hence, of course, Huawei.Universities, desperate for the much larger fees that can be charged to foreign students, sold their services to China. In 2012, for example, Cambridge University set up the Chong Hua chair in Chinese Development with £3.7 million from Wen Ruchun, the daughter of the super-rich then Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. Peter Nolan, who had taught her at Cambridge, took up the professorship. He had written a book with her husband, Liu Chunhang, a Chinese banking regulator. In the same year, Professor Nolan published a book called Is China Buying the World?, a question to which his short answer was “No”. But some said it had succeeded in buying a professorship at Cambridge. The Daily  exposed these connections.Professor Nolan stepped down from the Chong Hua chair last year. It remains unfilled, perhaps because, if you want it, you must demonstrate a “research record of international stature in ‘global China’.” In recent months, the concept of “global China” has made millions of people feel sick.In a speech to Peking University last year, the current Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, Stephen Toope, praised Professor Nolan’s work. He declared that the China Development Forum’s theme of “Greater Opening Up for Win-Win Cooperation” “thrilled” him. China and Cambridge are on the same side, he said, wanting openness rather than “angry isolation”, and a “global society” against those who wish to “ide and conquer”. These isive conquerors were unnamed but Professor Toope’s openness to the Chinese Communist Party contrasts with his attitude to Brexit. Last year, his university prevented contributions in favour of Brexit on its website while allowing numerous anti-Brexit ones.In the professors’ speeches on China, I cannot find the phrase “academic freedom”, perhaps because China permits no such thing. Chinese universities are controlled by the Communist Party. Chinese influence and money threaten academic freedom here in Britain. Scared of Chinese displeasure, otherwise reputable universities try to prevent speakers on campus who criticise the Chinese government. Members of their academic bodies are sometimes controlled by the Chinese embassy in London. I am told by dons that Chinese students nowadays shut up in the presence of other Chinese students, because each fears the other will report them to the embassy.I spoke yesterday to Stephen Tsang, Professor of Chinese Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies. China’s obsession with control, he says, is an eternal problem. The question is how we face it: “The real issue is when British universities do not defend their own intellectual freedoms.” “Self-censorship” is rife. Some universities are held hostage by the campuses they have opened in China itself.This week a reader sent me a strange message put out by the Peking University HSBC Business School. Although it perches in Boars Hill, near Oxford, it announced that it was proudly donating “1,000 pieces of PPE clothing, 300 protective medical goggles, and batches of test kits to Cambridge University Hospitals”. The message lauds Professor Toope for all the deals he has done with Peking University. Then the dean of the business school praises his own gift: Cambridge “really needs help” and a “friend in need is a friend indeed”.A friend indeed? It seems an odd phrase for a system of governmental, scientific and intellectual control whose secretiveness and mendacity have created the most sudden and widespread health crisis in history. Our politicians, professors and businessmen need to realise that the West has been insulted. Trust has succumbed to the disease. It cannot be restored by the gift of a few thousand (malfunctioning) face-masks. An international inquiry is a necessary start, yet our Government shies away from calling for one.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

That move confirmed her substantial role in the government.There has been speculation about Kim\u0027s health after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on April 15.It is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state.South Korea\u0027s government has repeatedly downplayed speculation that Kim, believed to be 36, was in poor health following surgery.The office of President Moon Jae-in said it detected no unusual signs in North Korea.It said it believed Kim was still managing state affairs, but staying at an unspecified location outside Pyongyang.It was not immediately clear what caused Kim\u0027s absence in past weeks.In 2014, Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks and then reappeared with a cane.South Korea\u0027s spy agency said he had a cyst removed from his ankle.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch covid 19 teaches us human behaviour","story":"What can our response to pandemics tell us about our social psychologies?

On hearing their symptoms, one official in ground control remarked: “I\u0027m not a doctor, but it sounds like Asian flu.”Debate raged in Houston about what to do, amid fears that the astronauts had caught the H3N2 strain of influenza after meeting with President Lyndon Johnson - who had spent his final weeks at the White House fighting this disease - just before their mission.It was soon decided that they likely had little more than nausea, and so were free to become the first crew to fly to the Moon, orbit it and return. If they suffered any worse in their December 1968 flight, drastic action would have been necessary.The pandemic had been raging since July, when it was first picked up in Hong Kong, prompting some to name it after the then British colony.Others referred to it as “Mao flu” given the widespread belief it had originated in China, coming across the river from Macau. It was not possible to determine for sure as the Chinese were not then members of the World Health Organization, and so evaded monitoring by its national influenza centres.This flu was the first aided in its spread by mass air travel, spreading swiftly though South East Asia. Troops brought it unwittingly to America on their return from the Vietnam War. In return, two hundred British soldiers had their leave delayed after one of them was found to have caught the flu on his return from Colorado.Like the ongoing coronavirus, most people survived the Asian flu, with it deemed a relatively mild disease normally healthy people would recover from after several days. One Hong Kong official told journalists that anyone infected should stay at home and rest, adding: “In the meantime, they can take aspirin, tea, lemon drinks, whisky or brandy according to taste.”But it was highly contagious, which raised concerns about how vulnerable the elderly would be. A spokesperson for the UK’s Medical Research Council warned that it would “spread through the country like wildfire”, and doctors feared it could prove particularly lethal in winter as part of a three-pronged assault alongside existing flu strains.The worldwide response to the Asian flu was similar in many ways to Covid-19, with a greater degree of handwashing. But people still went to work, preventing any lockdown by staying socially distant and avoiding packed public transportation. Dr Joan Gomez captured this stoic attitude in her advice to  readers at the start of 1969, urging them to “boost your resistance with a decent breakfast before plunging into the battleground of rush-travel”.The economy continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace, as governments prevented a recession by refraining from shutting down industry. As Philip Snashall, a now retired professor of medicine whose two-year-old daughter contracted the first case of the Asian flu to hit Europe, recorded in the British Medical Journal: “The stock market did not plummet, we were not besieged by the press, men in breathing apparatus did not invade my daughter’s play group.”Society and business did not stop as the Asian flu ran through the population. Schools stayed open, with the Department of Health acknowledging there had been two outbreaks, but by early 1969 it had not spread beyond that. Doctors argued that younger people aged between 5 and 25 tended to have enough antibodies to be effectively immune.Sports were still played, although Fulham’s second ision football match against Preston was called off but only because 11 of the club’s players had the flu rather than for public safety concerns.Meanwhile, there was an intense scramble to produce enough vaccines to keep up with the expected demand, reportedly on 24-hour production schedules. The then Labour Government insisted that it would meet its target to have 900,000 doses of vaccine ready by the end of the year in order to protect high-risk cases.“The demand has been unprecedented,” the boss of one drug manufacturer said in November 1968. “We have sold in a few days what we would have sold in a year”. Companies had to wrestle with snags - like some of the doses they produced not being potent enough to work, making the available supply much scarcer. This made the Conservative-controlled Greater London Council\u0027s decision to order 2,000 for its own employees all the more controversial. We have services to run and we must run them, a spokesman explained, pointing out that the vaccinated key workers included sewer, fire and ambulance men. This came amid frustration from business leaders, who were struggling to obtain vaccines to protect their staff.Just as the British people are currently under pressure to “save the NHS”, the health service then was feeling the strain. The Papworth Chest and Heart Hospital in Cambridgeshire reported that it had to delay operations as the flu had struck down one-fifth of its nursing staff. Soon after, hospitals in London issued a yellow warning due to the rise of emergency admissions. The Government’s own flu minister, David Ennals, had to withdraw from constituency engagements after coming down with the disease.The tide turned against Asian flu at the start of 1969, with thousands of doses of vaccine now being distributed as health experts sought to save face, with the flu having not proven to be as severe as originally forecast. “Influenza is so unpredictable that it would be foolish to forecast what may happen,” a Department for Health spokesman said.Some doctors had predicted that a natural immunity, built up by the flu pandemic that had erupted a decade earlier in 1957, would dampen its severity. With demand for vaccines plummeting, British drug companies had built up such a great surplus that they started exporting them elsewhere.The early warning provided by Hong Kong back in June 1968 was credited with giving authorities enough time to prepare vaccines and to protect the people. British drug firms took the lead in the early months, with the Ministry of Health doing little more at the time than passing public enquiries onto them.This first wave from the Asian flu may not have prompted an economic shutdown, but the illness it caused among the workforce was estimated to have resulted in the loss of millions of man-hours in production. However, one reader wrote to The  bemoaning the somewhat excessive anxiety about the epidemic, concluding on December 23, 1968 that the flu was to be “gravely feared only by the already infirm” and praised health chiefs for doing “extraordinarily well, while getting pathetically little credit for their labours”.In the aftermath of the first wave, drug companies urged ministers to encourage annual vaccinations so that the population could be better protected against future virulent epidemics. A drug company boss complained: “Normally at this time of year when you have supplies nobody wants to know. When there\u0027s an epidemic everybody wants it.”Their suggestion turned out to be prescient, as the Asian flu resurfaced in a second wave at the end of 1969, which ended up being even deadlier. By the spring of 1970, it had killed over one million people worldwide, 80,000 of them in the UK.Perhaps the 1968 pandemic did not prompt a worldwide economic shutdown because the generation in power had a more sanguine attitude towards diseases. They had to contend with ailments like measles and mumps, and had only a few years earlier found a vaccine for polio.Nowadays, the H3N2 virus is still prevalent as a seasonal malady. In the same way, it is only a matter of time before Covid-19 joins this strain of flu as something else people will want to vaccinate themselves against.Additional reporting by Jasmine Cameron-ChilesheMore from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/02/TELEMMGLPICT000007663026_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoNNSexKcI53-HHJW8z5oHN2zu8eE3xlap_UxrZYPcsw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"french love health service not national religion","story":"The 2012 Olympics opening ceremony included a section devoted to the National Health ServiceIt was the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony that brought home the British fetishisation of the NHS. James Bond? Sure. The Queen and that helicopter stunt? Brilliant. A ballet of hospital beds, IV drips and nurses? Not the kind of nurse you might think of as fetish fodder, either - and still you all raved for weeks about Danny Boyle’s ballet. What was that about?Britain, like France, got her national health system in the immediate aftermath of World War Two: 1948 for you, 1945 for us. We like our “Sécu” (short for Sécurité Sociale). We’ve always been proud of it, even before this pandemic. Until the current crisis, it took very little to elicit from the bolshiest French citizen the punchline “We have the best medical system in the world.” Even when mismanagement of the Covid-19 crisis put a serious dent in this perception, and we saw our German neighbour effortlessly deploy twice as many ICU beds as us, we still maintained our trust. We clap for two minutes every evening from our isolated balconies.Yet, unlike you, we don’t and never did, worship La Sécu: we see it not as one of the glories of our Scepter’d Nation, but as the kind of public service one expects from a modern country, like good trains.The British fetishising of your health system seems very strange. It’s as if you are afraid that, at any minute, it might be taken from you as if any change would destroy the mysterious compact initiated by Beveridge. The NHS seems replacement and compensation for your lost Empire.Staffed by so many Commonwealth nationals, it becomes a post-colonial iteration of goodwill, slightly shabby as befits a true British institution. (We in France closed our last hospital ward in 1975 with some fanfare most hospital rooms are for one or two patients only the notion of mixed wards is rightly seen as unacceptable.)As patients, we feel you get a raw deal. France, a country that glorifies its top-heavy bureaucracy, still hasn’t dreamt up something threateningly called NICE. French doctors, paid less than half their British counterparts, would never countenance denying procedures for having the “wrong” lifestyle. (I once apologised to a surgeon for my belly fat, and he said “Madame, ce n’est pas votre problème, c’est le mien”, as if I had impugned his capacity to efficiently slice through the extra layer).We see as barbaric the obligation to go through a designated GP before seeing a specialist. When I felt a lump in my left breast two years ago, a text to the specialist got me an appointment the following day, testing within the week, and an operation three weeks later: never was I happier to be living in France rather than in the UK.I clap in the evening for our doctors and nurses, but I know they’re not infallible, and I don’t expect them to be. They’re not servants of a deity. They’re hardworking medical professionals, and I wouldn’t want to lay any wider responsibility on them: that’s plenty as it is. I wish they’d get a pay rise, though.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I do not mean coronavirus which, although unique in its particular structure, is not unprecedented in its consequences or its attributes. Terrible plagues – now called pandemics – appear repeatedly in the recorded history of virtually all peoples from pre-Biblical times to the current century.No, what is surprising is not the fact of an infectious disease which reaches global proportions. It is the almost universal willingness of governments to take extreme and potentially very damaging measures to protect what are expected to be quite small minorities of their populations and, even more remarkable, the willingness of the majority of those populations to accept such measures.An enormous number of people, living in societies with different political, religious and ethical traditions, are consenting (largely without protest) to restrictions and privations that they know are almost certain to damage their own futures, in the interests of protecting the (relatively) few. There have been instances in the historic past that were not entirely unlike this: the plague villages of the Middle Ages that voluntarily closed themselves off from the country at large, or the quarantines of cities in the twentieth century.But has there ever been such a mass voluntary adoption of self-inflicted sacrifice throughout the developed world?The British, as I have frequently written, are exceptional in this regard. They have behaved with a stoical, humorous, communal spirit that is unsurprising. But – without the humour and with rather more heavy-handed enforcement – so many other countries have accepted the same basic assumption: that it is the responsibility of the majority to protect a minority who are in particular danger.This principle is now apparently embedded in the modern social conscience to such an extent that it is scarcely being remarked upon. Before the moment passes, we should give it a thought, if only because it runs contrary to so much of the conventional wisdom.The idea that contemporary society, particularly in the free market economies, is addicted to selfish materialism – that it has lost the community solidarity that previous generations took for granted, that the egotism of the inidual now rules over all other considerations – has dominated the popular imagination for at least 40 years.This interpretation may have been rooted in a Left wing world view but it is tacitly accepted even on the Centre Right. Never mind that contributions to charities and participation in voluntary work have never been higher, which should have given an important clue to the weakness of the analysis.Now we have a substantive disproof of this calumny. In overwhelming numbers, ordinary people, most of whom must know that they are extremely unlikely to be at personal risk of dying from coronavirus, are willing to relinquish many of their personal freedoms and comforts in the altruistic hope of saving the lives of others. That is quite something.So where does it come from? Could it be that the prosperity and material comfort of modern life in the advanced economies has actually produced not selfishness, but the opposite? That because security and confident optimism have largely replaced desperation and a constant struggle for survival, the population as a whole can be more generous and forbearing?Ordinary people can now enjoy the moral satisfactions once available only to the very wealthy: benevolence and nobility of purpose. It is certainly true that there can be solidarity in poverty but this universalised sense of having the power to do good in the wider world is something different. (It has been perfectly captured, or exploited, in that stupendously successful government message: “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”.)There is a less appealing possibility, of course. Some analysts have suggested that advanced societies, having become accustomed to a world without serious want and with the extended longevity delivered by modern medicine, are simply more risk averse than their fatalistic predecessors. Put cynically, people now expect to live pretty much forever and consider death to be an outrage even long after the three score and ten years that was once considered a reasonable life .The decline of religious belief may have a part in this. Instead of accepting the end of life as a natural inevitability that gives meaning to one’s existence, it must now be seen as an enemy to be defeated at all costs. (Perhaps oddly, while we seem to have cast death as outside the normal order, we have come to accept an idea which is grotesquely unnatural: that iniduals who are loved by others should die alone.)Or could it be that much of the world’s population has grown up so accustomed to affluence that it simply cannot conceive of the possibility that it might be lost? Has this age of secure employment and economic growth bred an unrealistic blithe confidence that truly bad times – of hardship and despair – could never return?Then again, maybe this isn’t about either economics or metaphysics. Perhaps it is the rise of democratic politics that has transformed the notion of public responsibility – even in countries that are not democratic.The general assumption that government exists to promote the greater good is a principle to which even most modern totalitarian countries must pay lip service. In fact, the most common justification for dictatorship is that people are happier under its rule. So if governments – and nation states – only exist to promote the wellbeing of their populations, then the moral duty of care of national leaders and of their peoples must be sacred. And what could be more worthwhile than the desire to prolong the lives of others? In a world where the value of inidual freedom and self-determination are taken for granted, one’s personal obligation becomes greater.Whatever the causes, we now clearly live in a world in which it is taken for granted that our responsibility to one another is absolute and must be counted into the equation whatever the cost. That has to have been a lesson worth learning.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Germany fell below that number some weeks ago, on April 7 and France on April 6. It has left the UK - where the peak is believed to have occurred around April 8 - behind the pack. The number of new infections has fallen by just under 25 per cent in the three weeks since.In Norway and Switzerland new cases have fallen by more than 80 per cent since their peaks, which occurred in late March.In France, Germany and Spain, some of the largest outbreaks in Europe, new cases have fallen by more than 70 per cent since their peaks - in early April.If the UK continues to plateau it could follow a similar trajectory as Belgium, where daily infections stagnated at over 100 per million for 25 days, meaning their lockdown will have lasted just shy of two months when it begins to be lifted on May 11 .Those countries which moved to impose lockdowns earliest have been able to start reopening their economies in recent weeks.Denmark allowed schools to reopen on April 13, followed by some small businesses a week later. The country was one of the first in Europe to take action to arrest movement, imposing a lockdown on March 11, almost two weeks before the UK.In the Czech Republic a state of emergency was declared the same day, before the country had recorded its first death, and an easing of restrictions came on April 20.It meant total lockdown was only in place for 33 days in Denmark and 40 days in the Czech Republic.Both countries are now seeing average movement rise again, by 22 percentage points in the Czech Republic, and Denmark by 20 percentage points.Switzerland went into lockdown on March 16 but did not begin to lift restrictions for 42 days, and in Norway measures were in place for 43 days. If the UK target of March 7 remains, it would have been 45 days under strict lockdown.But movement is also on the rise in countries which remain under quarantine, as people grow restless. Since the first week of lockdown cracks have begun to show in people\u0027s resolve.In the UK and Italy movement has risen by six percentage points (pp) since the start of April, and in the Netherlands and Belgium, where plans are in place to begin lifting measures by May 11, movement is up by 14 pp.After the first week of lockdown cracks began to emerge in people\u0027s resolve.According to mobility data from Apple, public transport (transit) use fell to around 15 per cent of average levels by March 28 in the UK - just four days after the lockdown was enforced.Walking and driving fell to lows of 30 per cent and  25 per cent the following day. But since then movement has been gradually on the rise.By the end of April driving was up 10pp and walking up by 20pp. The UK was also slow off the mark to curb travel.In France, driving was reduced to 15 per cent, walking to 10 per cent and transit to 10 per cent, all by March 22.In Italy, driving hit a low of 13 per cent on the same day. Walking was down to 10 per cent on March 29 and public transport use brought down to 8.5 per cent by early April.Across Spain driving was reduced to 10 per cent, public transport to eight per cent and walking to six per cent by March 22.All have seen gradual increases in movement as frustrations with quarantine grow, but from a lower baseline.George Batchelor, Director at Edge Health, said that the UK\u0027s prolonged peak could be for a variety of reasons - including a later lockdown and more travel around the country after the virus took hold.The basic principle is that the more people connected with others after the lockdown, the less rapid the effect of lockdown - the disease continued to spread albeit within smaller groups (households) of people, he said.Despite the economic and social pressure to begin to relax the lockdown, the government has insisted preventing the virus from spreading is paramount.Prof Chris Whitty said every country has now got an extremely difficult balancing act in deciding on the best course of action amid calls to ease lockdown measures. A Downing Street spokesman said on Thursday that: “We don’t want to relax social distancing or do anything that could lead to the virus being able to spread in an exponential way again.“People have made huge sacrifices to bring down the rate of infection and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away.”The spokesman added: “The date we are working to is May 7 and that’s where minds are focused.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/21/15/avengers-mark-ruffalo.jpg","title":"avengers endgame mcu ranking best worst character captain america black widow","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.It’s staggering to think that\u0026nbsp10 years ago, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was yet to assemble any Avengers.Now, 24\u0026nbspfilms later – and with the “epic conclusion”\u0026nbspreached in\u0026nbspEndgame, which is celebrating its first anniversary\u0026nbsp– the film series has introduced 27 world-saving characters.After the introduction of the originals – including Iron Man, Captain America and Black Widow – it seemed unlikely that characters introduced in future films would rank alongside them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt turns out that assumption was wildly incorrect – thanks to s of the Galaxy, Black Panther and the MCU’s first female-led film Captain Marvel, starring Brie Larson, those originals have been given a run for their money.Below, we\u0026nbsprank every single Avenger (NB: we’ve omitted SHIELD agents Nick Fury, Phil Coulson and Maria Hill).Scroll through the\u0026nbspgallery to see our picks.Created with Sketch.

Discouraging data also came in on China’s economy, which is concerning for anyone expecting a first-in-first-out economic wave.“This is the saddest day for the global economy we have ever seen” in the 50 years that economists at High Frequency Economics have been following economic data, they wrote in a report. “The statistical offices of the economies we watch pumped out 19 economic reports overnight.

We are sad.”The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 0.61 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 0.63 per cent\u0026nbsplate on Thursday. It started the year close to 1.90 per cent. Treasury yields tend to fall when investors are downgrading their expectations for the economy and inflation.In currency trading, the dollar fetched 107.09 Japanese yen, down from 107.13 yen on Thursday.

But they have largely attempted to do that by impersonating him, including taking control of other verified accounts and making them look as if they were Mr Musk\u0027s official account.The new outburst came as Nasa announced that one of Mr Musk\u0027s other companies, SpaceX, was one of three firms in the running to make the lunar lander for humanity\u0027s return to the moon\u0027s surface. SpaceX already has a number of key contracts with the US government, including one that will see it send Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station in a matter of weeks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You are not following the rules. You need to keep your head down and stay indoors.”Lennie James: ‘The Tories have been dishonest about coronavirus’Gossip girl: How Jessica Simpson reinvigorated the celebrity memoirA neighbour of the chef’s said: “He’s out all the time. He’ll go to fishmongers and shops to get food for his barbecues. He doesn’t abide by the rules.”It’s also been claimed that Ramsey has visited his holiday home in Fowey\u0026nbsp– located 25 miles away from his residence –\u0026nbspto visit his daughter, Holly, while the boyfriends of two\u0026nbspothers\u0026nbsphave allegedly been regularly dropping in to visit.These claims come after Ramsay was branded a “hypocrite” for appearing in a cookery video that\u0026nbspurged people to “stay at home... to stop this dreadful virus”.The Independent has contacted Gordon Ramsay for comment.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If proven effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients a week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn\u0026nbspIreland,\u0026nbsptaoiseach\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspannounced the country will begin its journey to a new normal after a further two weeks of the current lockdown restrictions, though people will be allowed to travel further to exercise and self-isolating over-70s will be advised they can leave home for a walk or drive in the coming days.It comes as the global number of infections passed 3.3 million, with over 237,000 deaths reported.Follow the latest updatesGovernment accused of \u0027misleading public\u0027 on testing figuresPotential treatment using blood plasma on trial in UKUS regulators allow emergency use of remdesivir drugGlobal number of infections passes 3.3 millionSpain to require public transport commuters to wear masksThe Spanish government will require commuters on public transportation to wear masks, starting on Monday.\u0026nbspThe prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, made the announcement today,\u0026nbspwhen Spaniards were allowed outdoors to exercise for the first time in seven weeks.Mr Sanchez said he will\u0026nbspask parliament for an extension of the state of emergency established 14 March and set to expire on 9 May.\u0026nbspAlso on Monday, people can go to restaurants and cafes to take away food. Bookstores, hair salons and some retail outlets can open.\u0026nbspMr Sanchez said:\u0026nbspNow we are finally seeing the results of all these weeks of confinement ...\u0026nbspand we deserve some relief.\u0026nbspSpain\u0027s death toll for the virus reached 25,100 after 276 more people died in the last 24 hours. That\u0027s down from more than 900 daily deaths reported a month ago.\u0026nbspThe total confirmed infections reached 216,582, with another 1,147 reported cases in the last day.\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0027s Covid-19 death toll reaches 376There have been 11 further deaths in Northern Ireland of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total fatalities in the region recorded so\u0026nbspfar by the Department of Health to 376.\u0026nbspCoronavirus cases in Wales pass 10,000 markA further 44 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 969, Public Health Wales has said.Another 183 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 10,155.NHS England announces 370 new deathsNHS England has announced 370 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,853.Of the 370 new deaths announced today:- 75 occurred on 1 May- 149 occurred on 30 April- 52 occurred on 29 AprilThe figures also show 85 of the new deaths took place between 1 and 28\u0026nbspApril while the remaining nine deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 13 March.NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago.This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated.The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April\u0026nbspcontinues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 864.Dutch cases pass 40,000The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in the Netherlands has increased by 445 to 40,236, Dutch health authorities said today.The National Institute for Public Health reported 94 new deaths, taking total Covid-19 fatalities to 4,987.Spain to make mask usage compulsory on public transportSpain’s prime minister has announced that the use of masks on public transport will be compulsory from Monday and said the government will distribute 14.5 million masks.At a press conference on Saturday, Pedro Sanchez also said his government would approve a 16bn euro (£14bn) reconstruction fund to help regional authorities cope with the social and economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic.High street law firms under threat of closureMost high street law firms will be forced to close this year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Law Society survey.The results showed 71 per cent\u0026nbspof small law firms believe they may have to close their doors within the next six months because of social distancing hindering face-to-face transactions, court hearings and the wider economy.The Law Society defines high street law firms as those with four partners or fewer, and the survey results were based on answers from 774 firms.President of the Law Society, Simon Davis, said the shock to the legal system has been sudden and severe and firms face a dramatic plunge in income.He said: Although a firm may be open for business, this does not mean it is business as usual.Residential property transactions have ground to a halt. Reduction in court hearings has massively impacted on the amount of work available - while social distancing and the lack of face-to-face meetings is causing difficulty delivering in other areas, such as the execution of wills.Elsewhere, small firms have suffered from the decline in overall activity - particularly from service industries such as retail, leisure and hospitality.The fate of the high-street firm is thus intrinsically bound to that of other small businesses.Irish government agrees measures to help businesses reopenFollowing a special cabinet meeting, the Irish government has agreed a series of measures to help businesses reopen following the coronavirus lockdown.It comes after the publication on Friday night of the Government\u0027s five-stage roadmap for reopening society and business.The measures include:- A €10,000 (£11,268) restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rateswaiver rebate from 2019.- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses.- A €2bn\u0026nbsp(£2.2bn) pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF)- A €2bn (£2.2bn) Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years, which will be below market interest rates.- The warehousing of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.- A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall to continue to provide full services to the public.Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to minimise the damage of the pandemic.Our collective public health has been targeted our businesses and our economy have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden and our society is grappling with this new reality. But, by working together, we are minimising the damage, he said.On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting our people, and wider society, and rebuilding our economy so that we can get people back to work safely. We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people.JK Rowling to donate £1m to charitiesHarry Potter author JK Rowling has said she will donate £1m to be split between charities Refuge and Crisis.Announcing the move on Twitter, she wrote: Today\u0027s the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I\u0027m going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world.So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I\u0027m thinking of the people who\u0027re out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life.I have three\u0026nbspkey workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I\u0027m torn between pride and anxiety.As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I\u0027ll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to Crisis, who\u0027re helping the homeless during the pandemic, and half of which will go to Refuge, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown.NHS staff \u0027breaking down\u0027 on front lineNHS staff are breaking down on the front line tackling coronavirus and their mental health must be made a priority now rather than when the crisis is over, Labour has warned.Shadow mental health minister and A\u0026ampE doctor Rosena Allin-Khan has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to seek assurances that medics are getting the support they need.In the letter, she said: Increasingly, NHS staff are breaking down - I see it first-hand working shifts.From a fear of spreading the virus to patients and loved ones, a lack of PPE, an increased workload owing to the number of cases and staff absences, to being redeployed to ICUs and witnessing more patients die - staff are experiencing greater pressure, which is inevitably taking its toll on their mental health.At this time of crisis, staff mental health must be a priority now. It simply cannot be an afterthought once the acute stage of the crisis is over.German cases rise by nearly 1,000The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose by 945 to 161,703, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed today.The death toll rose by 94 to 6,575.South Korea continues month-long streak of below 100 new infectionsSouth Korea has reported six fresh cases of coronavirus, continuing a month-long streak of below 100.Infections continue to wane in the hardest-hit city of Daegu, where no new cases were detected.Figures released by South Korea\u0027s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention today\u0026nbspbrought national figures to 10,780 cases and 250 virus-related deaths.At least 1,081 cases have been linked to international arrivals, but these cases have also declined in recent weeks as the government strengthened border controls, such as enforcing 14-day quarantines on all passengers coming from overseas.Pakistan records highest single-day increase in infectionsPakistan recorded its highest single-day increase in new Covid-19 infections with 1,297 cases reported to bring the total in the country of 220 million people to 18,114.The increase also coincides with a growing number of daily tests being carried out.In the last 24 hours, Pakistan conducted more than 9,000 tests, also its largest single day testing as it struggles to climb to daily testing of 20,000 promised nearly two weeks ago by its prime minister, Imran\u0026nbspKhan.Even as the number of new cases increase pictures in local newspapers showed large numbers of the faithful attending some of Pakistan\u0027s mosques with only sporadic signs of the social distancing rules imposed by the government when it refused to shut down mosques during Ramadan, Islam\u0027s fasting month.Mr Khan\u0027s government has also suggested it might ease lockdown rules governing retail shops ahead of the holiday of Eid-ul Fitr that marks the end of Ramadan, later this month.Iran\u0027s death toll passes\u0026nbsp6,100Iran\u0027s death toll from new coronavirus increased by 65 in the past 24 hours to 6,156 today, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV.The total number of diagnosed cases in Iran, one of the hardest hit Middle Eastern countries, has reached 96,448, he said, adding that 2,787 were in critical condition.Please allow a moment for the blog to loadNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So, Keanu’s gotta go finish his commitment up on The Matrix, which is a big deal and which I think will probably take him until the end of the year. Then we have to go into our prep mode and then we’ll start.”How Keanu Reeves could return as Neo in The Matrix 4Why All About Eve is as topical as it was 70 years agoNilüfer Yanya on Tirzah’s beautifully human debut albumAs Stahelski mentioned, The Matrix 4 has also had its production\u0026nbspshut down, but director Lana Wachowski is yet to comment on a change to its\u0026nbsprelease scheduling.Should the new John Wick film change release dates, it would certainly\u0026nbspput an end to any high-concept theories relating to a crossover between the two films.It seems like this particular theory was too good to be true, even if it seemed entirely plausible (read more on it here).Created with Sketch.The 27 worst film sequels of all time Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease. But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat. Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing.

Altogether, the contracts for the initial 10-month period total 967 million US dollars.This is the last piece that we need in order to get to the moon by 2024, Mr Bridenstine said.Nasa shares images of \u0027doomed\u0027 Comet Atlas as it breaks into piecesHe noted it will be the first lunar lander since the last Apollo moon mission in 1972.Over the next 10 months, each company will refine its concept and Nasa will decide which lander to test first.Mr Bridenstine said Nasa will go with the company that has the highest probability of success by 2024.Nasa will rely on its own Orion capsules and Space Launch System megarockets - still under development - to launch astronauts to the moon.The two other companies, Boeing and Vivace, put in bids but were eliminated early on, leaving the three awarded contracts.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The Dynetics lander is so low to the ground that only a few steps are needed, like a front porch, a feature that Nasa gave high marks for safety and efficiency.SpaceX is using its own Starship spacecraft - still under development in Texas - and its own rockets. Blue Origin and Dynetics are partnering with numerous subcontractors, including commercial launch companies.Going commercial, Mr Bridenstine said, will drive down costs while increasing access.It builds off of Nasa\u0027s commercial cargo and crew programs for the International Space Station.Just last November, SpaceX and Blue Origin were among the companies that won contracts to make cargo deliveries to the moon.Nasa wants the new Artemis moon-landing programme to be sustainable, unlike Apollo, with multiple missions and multiple locations on the lunar surface.While only one company will carry the first woman and next man to the lunar surface, all three will participate over the long haul, officials noted.By learning how to live and work on another world - the moon - Nasa will be better equipped to eventually send astronauts to Mars, Mr Bridenstine said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reckless endangerment of public safety by greedy social media firms must stop.”A spokesperson for Twitter said it was removing coronavirus-related content “when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm”.“We will not take enforcement action on every tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about Covid-19,” a statement added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The performance has a full production team working behind the scenes and is directed by the award-winner Sam Yates.Money raised from ticket sales will be given to The Felix Project, The Independent’s campaign partner, and to support out-of-work professionals in the theatre industry including a costume designer and a stage manager.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Tom’s play, a comedy set in a private nursing home, follows a seemingly healthy man who attempts to shut himself off from the world. It is the first of the Remote Reads produced by artistic non-profit organisations Platform Presents and Apples and Oranges Arts.Morrissey said: “I’m very excited to be taking part in this live reading. It’s a beautifully written piece by Tom Stoppard and I’m looking forward to performing it.”How to support our campaignThe former Walking Dead villain, who has been volunteering for The Felix Project for about 18 months, praised the charity for “working tirelessly at this very challenging time”.A depot coordinator for The Felix Project commended Morrissey for being “a brilliant ambassador” for the charity.“From his first shift, he was grabbing crates, ing in, just going above and beyond.”\u0026nbspThe Independent launched the Help The Hungry campaign to support the work of The Felix Project in redistributing food to frontline charities, vulnerable iniduals and NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.Sir Tom said: “It’s a delightful surprise to find that a play that I haven’t really thought about for over half a century is getting a new production, especially with such a stunning cast. It’s about the last thing I expected and I’m quite excited about it.“The play was actually written as one half of a 60-minute slot, the other half of which was a documentary about chess players. The idea was that the film and the play would somehow complement each other. The idea was that the man in the play and the chess players were finding some kind of sanctuary in a closed world.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown.

Recent polling shows a significant proportion of the population said\u0026nbspthey would not be comfortable if lockdown measures were lifted too soon.A survey by Ipsos Mori\u0026nbspfound just 21 per cent said they would be comfortable using public transport in the same way as before if lockdown measures were lifted in the next month, with 61 per cent saying they would not be.41 per cent said they would be comfortable sending their child to school while\u0026nbsp48 per cent said they would not. More than a third (39 per cent) expressed discomfort about shopping in supermarkets in the same way as they did pre-pandemic.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Questions remain, however,\u0026nbspabout the extent to which they could act as carriers to transmit the illness to more vulnerable people.The business department is expected to publish recommendations for workplaces next week, but the Financial Times reports that offices may be told to keep their staff working from home for several months where possible –\u0026nbspin part to keep

Social areas at work like canteens could be kept closed or asked to operate on a socially-distanced basis.Other businesses may also face new guidelines or rules as they reopen: with wider walkways on building sites to help social distancing and increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in some factories.“What you are going to get next week is really a road map, a menu of options. The dates and times of each inidual measure will be very much driven by where we are in the epidemic, what the data is really saying and we are getting in a lot more data every day now and in the course of the next few days,” Boris Johnson said on Thursday at a regular Downing Street press conference.Asked about the public transport plan, a Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Experts are constantly looking at best practice around the world”, and the government would carry on being “guided by the scientific evidence that is available”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s extremely disappointing the government have decided to massage the metrics rather than admit they fell short, as this will only undermine public confidence.”He said that “the British public won’t be so easily fooled by manipulation” and that the UK was “still miles off the large-scale testing programme that will be an essential part of any plan to ease out of lockdown through a test, trace and isolate approach”.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Staff react outside Salford Royal

counted once, and you can count tests when they go out or when they come back in, and whichever way you do it we still meet the target,” he said.He added that the use of home testing kids was “very satisfactory” despite concern that results from the self-swab kits may not be as accurate.Professor Newton had previously stated: “For any tests which go outside of the control of the programme, they are counted as soon as they leave the programme. That’s for the tests that go out to people home and in satellite centres.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

bid to achieve 100,000 daily coronavirus tests by the end of April, with official figures released at Downing Street showing 122,347 tests in the UK on Thursday.But there were accusations that the government had moved the goalposts to achieve the ambitious deadline, by including more than 27,000 home-testing kits at the point they were sent out to members of the public rather than waiting until\u0026nbspthe test has\u0026nbspbeen completed.Thursday’s figure - on the final day of the deadline - represented a leap of more than 18,000 from the previous day’s tally of 81,611.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt brought the total number of antigen tests - which show whether an inidual currently has the illness - over the course of the outbreak to more than a million, though the UK\u0027s\u0026nbsp1,023,824 remains well behind\u0026nbspGermany, where 50,000 were being tested a day as early as\u0026nbspthe start of April.Mr Hancock also announced that he aims to have an army of 18,000 contact tracers in place by mid-May to track down contacts of those shown by tests to be positive for Covid-19.Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock revealed that the total UK\u0026nbspdeath toll has risen to 27,510 over the course of the outbreak, with 739 fatalities in all settings on Thursday.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers

total, which was at about 10,000 when Mr Hancock set his target at the start of April and was hovering around 20,000 little more than a week ago, was rapidly increased over the past few days with the

“incredible achievement”.He said: “I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal, because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet.”He praised his team for

But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out. Tonight’s headline figure shouldn’t count tests that hadn’t been used -\u0026nbspor indeed, might never be used - as a completed test. Ministers promised transparency - the public and NHS staff deserve clarity.“In any event, this figure was never a strategy. We need a fully resourced testing, isolation and tracing programme and ministers should be using this lockdown time to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.”Mr Hancock said that the testing capacity now available was “crucial to suppress the virus” and would “help us to unlock the lockdown”.It would be backed up by an initial 18,000 contact-tracers to be in place by the middle of May, with more to be recruited if required.“The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new Covid-19 NHS app, will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections,” he said.Speaking a day after prime minister Boris Johnson promised a “roadmap” out of lockdown, Mr Hancock said: “In recent weeks we’ve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones and yet our goal must be freedom.“Freedom from the virus, yes - and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so - but also we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too – each citizen’s right to do as they please.“For now, we’re working together to stay home, we’re impinging on the freedom of all for the safety of all.“With this next mission of test, track and trace, I’m seeking a solution that allows us, by each of us participating, to target the measures that are needed with much more precision and so to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all.”Prof Newton rejected suggestions that the UK’s slow adoption of mass testing had “kept us in lockdown a day longer”.Stay-at-home measures were introduced in March not because of a lack of tests but because of the wide circulation of the Covid-19 virus in the population, he said.“Cases were popping up with no obvious connection to other cases and the infection was entering the exponential growth phase and at that point access to limitless testing even if we had had it would’ve made no difference,” he said.“The decision to enter into lockdown would have been the same and would’ve been taken at the same time.“In the same way the route out of lockdown has not been blocked by low levels of testing. We can relax social distancing only when the Government’s five tests are met, and that means particularly getting the infection rate right down.“Testing will help to keep it out of control once we’re out of lockdown but our levels of testing have not kept us in lockdown a day longer.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And it makes it imperative that we give ourselves the best chance to defeat it. This means bringing together the world’s best – and most prepared – minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again, while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa.”“If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century.

Large elements could continue into June and beyond.Lockdown is expected to be lted in stages amid Treasury fears that businesses wont survive past June.It is understood that restrictions and social distancing measures will stay in place evenworkplaces and schools reopen.An ally of the Prime Minister told The : May  is the day when the Government is legally obliged to review the lockdown measures butBoris wants to change the restrictions earlier than that, or at least announce something before that, then he could go sooner.Talking about lting the lockdown is using the wrong language, we need to be talking about modying the lockdown.There is definitely a sense that we could be doing more than we are at the moment in terms of people being to work, especiallythey are working outdoors.Dominic Raab - the Foreign Secretary, who stood in for Boris Johnson while he was recovering from Covid- at Chequers - has said that the UK must continue to work hard to bring coronavirus numbers down.The Cabinet has been split between the doves and the hawks.The doves, who coincidentally have both had coronavirus, oppose lting lockdown early as it could cause a second wave and further economic and health damage.The “hawks” are those more worried about the economic impact of a long-term shutdown and want to ease restrictions sooner.On Thursday, April , Mr Raab held an emergency Cobra meeting with the other devolved nations.They considered scientic advice which concluded that the shutdown measures had helped Britain control the pandemic, but experts said it was not yet time to ease off on them.However on April , police issued a new set of guidelines detailing what people can and cant doEnglands chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty said he would expect the number of deaths to continue rising for at least two weeks past when the number of people in intensive care starts to flatten off.Government advisers believed April  was the likely peak date - but it is not knownthe peak has passed yet.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden believes the lockdown will last for the full three months.Emergency measures were first announced by Mr Johnson on March .The unprecedented step was put in place in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus.In a televised address, the Prime Minister announced police would have the power to fine peoplethey left their homes for non-essential reasons.He said people were allowed to leave their homes for the following reasons:The nationwide lockdown restrictions came under review on Thursday, April , when First Secretary of State, Dominic Raab, revealed the outcomes from the first lockdown review.He said: The Government has decided the current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks.They will be reviewed again on May , when ministers will decide whether to lt any restrictions.May : May Day protests around the world spark fears of a covid resurgence.April :  Johnson hosts his first briefing since his .

But the one thing we all have in common is le under the coronavirus lockdown.This unfamiliar existence can be lonely or claustrophobic or both, depending on your circumstances.With adventuring on hold, my world now exists entirely of a small flat with just one short outing each day.Adapting to the new circumstances surrounding Covid- is essential for both physical health and mental wellbeing.Here Charlie shares the  lessons he has learned to survive le under lockdown...We spend our regular lives trying to avoid boring schedules.But when outside your comfort zone planned chunks of time help the hours pass painlessly.Listlessness leads to haplessness. When I walked alone across the Gobi desert I faced weeks with only plodding, eating and sleeping on the agenda.My only goal was to get from one side of the vast inhospitable region to the other.However, I built a daily routine as follows: breakfast, walk two hours, snack, walk two hours, lunch, walk two hours, snack, walk two hours, dinner, sleep.This not only provided me with structure and purpose, but it also gave me things to look forward to spaced evenly throughout the day Normally, coming home from work to a flatmate or loved one is a great opportunity to natter about the details of your day.However,you’ve spent the entire day getting in each other’s way, trying to work while entertaining the kids, or fuming at the annoying hold music on your travel insurance helpline, there might not be much to catch up on.When I skied , miles through Arctic Siberian winter in temperatures down to -˚C, I was in the company of just one friend and on more than one occasion we went a month without encountering a single other human.We skied together all day and shared a cramped tent at night.At first we felt compelled to make small talk but we soon learned that contented quiet is healthy.The trick to muted harmony was simply to confirm once a day that we hadn’t done anything to upset or offend each other.Otherwise, all that silence can feel uncomfortable or even hostile.It’s a surprisingly fine line between grinding loneliness and blissful solitude.Many of us long for exactly what we don’t have. In the midst of busy lives in crowded public spaces we often yearn for space and peace.When I cycled across Tibet in winter I was in the wilderness for six weeks in polar conditions with nobody to talk to and no phone or music player.Tibet is among the least populated places on Earth, and I often went many days without uttering a word.This started out as the loneliest and most upsetting experience of my le, but over time I learned to appreciate the fact that I was the absolute master of my time.I spent the days happily inside my own head taking stock, assessing my le, and making plans for the future.I could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted, and started to appreciate le’s smaller, simpler pleasures.For example, each morning I lay in my sleeping bag with a book and a coffee for an hour after breakfast.Whether it’s gardening, crafts, learning an instrument or DIY, we all have things we wish we did more of. When I rode a pony across the Mongolian steppe for two months I had long days to fill and there were only so many hours that my small steed could tolerate me in the saddle.I took up drawing to fill my copious free time.Each day I completed a couple of five-minute sketches and one longer, more detailed drawing, usually of my horse in the gaping grasslands.This lockdown is the perfect time to dig out the sketch pad again, once I’ve fixed the shower and ordered a didgeridoo online, that is!Better days are ahead and impatience will only make this feel more drawn out.When I was trekking through the Papua New Guinean interior I walked ten hours a day through some of the most inhospitable conditions imaginable.The equatorial jungle was impossibly dense. Hacking away with my machete, progress was often under five miles a day. It was monsoon season too.Daily downpours had me regularly slipping on mud and reflexively reaching out to grab branches or vines that were often covered in thorns.Leeches got into my shoes and so my socks ran red with blood when I wrung them out each evening. After a week of this I reached a river.The water was fast and riddled with rapids, but I was carrying an inflatable kayak and decided to take my chances.The possibility of a speedy escape from the jungle seemed preferable to the tortuously slow way out on foot.It wasn’t long before a rapid flipped me upside down and pinned me underwater among some tree roots.I was extremely lucky to escape with my le.

Yet on the other side of the world, South Korea has witnessed nothing like the same devastation.To date, there have been just  deaths in the Asian nation, and only , cases - barely a tenth of the British total.While Britain remains in the grip of the storm, South Korea is already emerging from the darkness.What makes this phenomenal gap all the more remarkable is the country’s closeness to China, the initial global centre of the pandemic - which should have left South Korea - a country of  million people - far more vulnerable than Britain to the ravages of the disease.But the South Korean authorities took this seriously, through their prompt action and ruthless efficiency, they quickly managed to get the virus under control.On  February, there had been  new cases, but this daily figure fell dramatically in the subsequent two months, dropping to single digits last week.Amid all the gloom across the earth, South Korea’s astonishing success is a beacon the world.And its achievement is particularly impressive because the nation has not resorted to Chinese or European-style lockdowns.Most of the population has not been placed under effective house arrest, nor has the economy been put into a medically-induced coma.Under strict rules about social distancing, bars, cafes, shops and hotels have remained open.One British journalist based in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, told me that he even had to queue last week for a table at a restaurant in a fashionable district, something that would be unthinkable in Britain.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before . And there were a group of comedians who’ve been forced on us, since then, who aren’t comedians at all. At best, they’re pub-funny show-offs — at worst they’re political propagandists trying to bend us to their will.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The contrast could not have been better illustrated by the segment where modern Mash Report types and old-school stand-ups were given about ten seconds to make us laugh and the only one who could nail it was Tim Vine, who appeared with a placard reading “Bad” and a punchline: “That’s not a good sign is it.”An actual punchline! On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours. Less is more, guys.TV astrologer Russell Grant made this uncanny  prediction, for those of us born in the star sign Cancer, late last year, in the Mirror.“Travel is on the cards in the spring and as much as you enjoy your home le, you will appreciate this change of scene.”Yeah, the Sainsbury’s queue was a blast, thanks Russ.“It’s not just The Big Night In, April  is, of course . . .”A St George’s Day B Shakespeare’s birthday C Darren Huckerby’s birthday It was D “The start of Ramadan.”The clue being in the letters BBC, of course.THE Dave channel has been attempting to ease the nation’s ever-present mental health worries via the gt of laughter.A noble cause and a good idea.Unfortunately, they’ve given the all-important job to some of the worst comedians in Britain.Last week, it was the turn of Nish Kumar, Suzi Ruffell, Seann Walsh and Darren Harriott, whose attempts to end Britain’s silent suffering were ided into two separate and contrasting segments.In the first, backstage, they discussed their own experiences of mental health issues, which sounded more like a lot of really bad hangovers, egotism and self-pity, while making the usual heartfelt pleas for tolerance, understanding and a constructive dialogue.’Cos, you know, they’re alive to the fact they’re meant to care.Then Kumar and Ruffell went out on stage and spewed vile, angry foul-mouthed hatred about Boris, Trump, Top Gear, Richard Hammond , fellow comedians and anyone who’s got what Ruffell calls “lazy opinions”.That is to say, anyone who has the temerity to hold a dferent political opinion to her own.Not a single word of it was funny, let alone healing.Darren Harriott, the least worst of them, though, did at least have the decency to provide the necessary cue.“I struggle to give people all of me ’cos I’m always worried they’re going to go, they’re going to disappear and . . .”Click.He’s got a point, hasn’t he.Paul Merson: “Bournemouth seem to keep coming up without answers.”Micah Richards: “The way he carried his body language was outstanding.”Matt Le Tissier: “Spurs are never going to win the league in a million years. Not at the moment anyway.”.IT was mild-mannered Jack Maynard who summed up John Fashanu’s many foibles best, after the former footballer had tried throttling DJ Locksmith on Channel ’s Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins.“Number four,” he said, with some feeling, “is a t**t.” He is indeed. He’s not the only one on that show, either. There’s strong competition to be the biggest one from Bluto-ish oaf Tony Bellew, the former world cruiserweight boxing champion, who’s got an even shorter fuse than Fashanu.Both have already been called in for fairly urgent “questioning” by the SAS instructors who always hold the whip hand during these interrogations as, at the first hint of vanity, derangement, pretension or self-delusion, Ant Middleton can shout “GUARD!” and Billy bundles them off with a hood over their head.If it was just a hardman staring contest, of course, the show wouldn’t work. But it’s not. Sometimes the Special Forces team are staring at contestants like “YouTuber” Jack Maynard, trying to get their heads around what the hell it is he actually does for a living.“I will come up with some video idea and I direct, film, edit and present the thing myself.”Billy : “So you’re actually a smart f***er.”There are also emerging friendships, hidden tensions, a lot of honest endeavour and a simmering feud between Paralympian Lauren Steadman and Joey Essex, which erupts on next week’s show .SAS: Who Dares Wins will have to proceed, though, without Katie Price, who quit after a feeble two-day effort, and Anthea Turner, who tried getting all philosophical just before she threw in her armband. “I feel I am in what the Japanese call my second spring.”Fetch the hood, Billy.MEANWHILE, over on episode two of I’ll Get This, Jermaine Jenas says to Sara Pascoe: “I’ll be waiting for the comedian in you to come out.”So we’ll check up on him again in November .C’s SAS: Who Dares Wins.

Most places will enjoy “dry and decent weather.”The high pressure will remain in charge for most of next week, meaning the warm sunny weather is here to stay for at least a few more days.The Met Office warns that while the weather change will tempt many across the country to spend their weekend outdoors, the UK must continue to adhere to the coronavirus lockdown.Simon Partridge encouraged people to enjoy the sunshine from their backyards, balconies and daily hour-long walks - though he did add that UV levels will be reasonably high over the weekend, so people must cover up accordingly.The high pressure build won’t last forever, and is expected to move on by the following weekend and bring with it more wet and miserable weather.The Met Office predicts an Atlantic weather system will bring further bands of rain in unsettled conditions for the first week of May.Officials warned that a weather cell blowing in from the would cause power showers- and the rain would go on into the month.The Met Office is now predicting settled, warmer weather for the beginning of the month, although we can still expect some showers, and itll be much cooler than last week.Aprils sunshine was caused by a high pressure system from the continent - but recently weve faced the opposite, with low pressure systems bringing in colder weather and lots of rain."},{"url":null,"title":"financial times mark di stefano zoom call","story":"Mark di Stefano joined a staff conference call for The Independent and Evening Standard, in which furlough news was broken to the employees.Di Stefano, who only joined the FT from BuzzFeed in January, was suspended and has now tendered his resignation.He confirmed the news on Twitter today, writing: Hi, letting everyone know today was my last day at the FT.This afternoon I offered my resignation.

Especially when you are dealing with a government like China’s.As viewers of the series Chernobyl know, non-democratic governments have a history of covering up their errors.In that case, the Soviets did everything they could to stop the world learning about the meltdown at their nuclear reactor.Today the Communist Party of China has done everything it can to hide what happened in Wuhan. Especially the origins of the disease which has shut down the world.Yesterday President Trump broke one of the taboos in all this. Which is needed.The question is: What is the likelihood the coronavirus originated in the exact part of China that has a laboratory looking into just such viruses To date the Chinese authorities have allowed the world to believe in the bat-eating, wet-market theory on the origins of the epidemic.They prefer embarrassment over suspicion.But all along, people have wondered whether something less “accidental” is at play.Now the US President has told reporters he has seen strong evidence that Covid- originated from the laboratory in Wuhan. The President’s remarks change the game.China should be in enough trouble as it is. Evenit was true that the virus is an accident caused by a strange food custom, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot to answer for.Why did it keep the news of the virus to itself for so many weeks  Why did it pretend it is not lethal as we now know it is Or pretend that it was hard to transmit  Why did they refuse to allow in inspectors from the World Health Organisation And why have the WHO now been refused inclusion in China’s own investigation into the origins of Covid- Questions also remain over the WHO’s seeming collusion with China over the crisis.The CCP’s actions would be bad enoughthe virus came from a wet market. But it must know that it is in a whole dferent realm of troublethe virus turns out to have come from its lab.If the CCP knew all along the virus had leaked from there then its cover-up is even more appalling. Because it means they knew exactly what they — and soon the world — were dealing with.But in the absence of trust-worthy information, darker and wilder theories take shape in the shadows. For example, could the virus have come from the Wuhan lab and been released deliberately To those deeply skeptical of the CCP, it’s not hard to believe it might have done that.They are in a trade war with America with a President who was making them lose. Now the CCP has managed to shut down the entire US economy with a virus.The question for the rest of the world will soon be simple: What to do about this There are several steps. The first is to try to determine exactly how this virus came about. To have an international  look into every possible cause. With no area of inquiry ruled out.That  should also investigate how the communist regime lied their way through this virus. We need to learn just how they managed to make a local problem into a global one.Then there is the question of what price they should pay. For accidental or not, there is no way that the CCP should be allowed to get away with this.Goodness knows they have tried. Throughout this crisis there have been a set of PR gestures by the Chinese authorities.The government and government-linked firms such as Huawei have made a big show of donating masks and other equipment.It is dismal. Like watching somebody who has just burned down your house offering you a watering can.Last month, German newspaper Bild infuriated China by suggesting Beijing should pay reparations for the coronavirus pandemic.It printed an “invoice’ for nearly billion eurosleading the Chinese embassy in Berlin to accuse the paper of stirring up prejudice.But once the engine of the other global economies — including ours — roars back into motion, we must make China pay.We must re-think our relationship with them. We should recognise the country is not just a competitor but a liability.We must punish them for the large-scale theft of information from British and American businesses it has engaged in for years.We must do whatever we can to disrupt their “belt-and-road” empire-building, which the CCP has worked its way into, and “bought up” small and poor countries.But it is not only such countries that are at the mercy of China and its President Xi Jinping. We may be in Britain too.Before this Wuhan disaster kicked off, our Government approved Huawei to provide part of our G capability.All of our allies warned against this. Our intelligence-sharing partners in the Five Eyes networkall strongly warned the British Government against allowing a firm that is indistinguishable from the CCP from having such access.Experience shows Chinese firms cannot be trusted to provide such sensitive — and strategic — technology.The Huawei decision was a rare misstep by the Johnson government. Now is the time to correct it.We do not need to provoke China. But nor do we need to pander to it. And we should not be putting our future security in their hands.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Especially Chris Hemsworth’s.This is having an effect on the nation’s teenagers. They have been told there will be no exams this year and that all their school work was for nothing. They’ve been told they have to stay indoors and that they can’t see their friends.And it’s driving them mad because they do not read newspapers. They do not listen to the BBC news.

And your empty bottle of Senokot.In fact, we should all get in on the act. Don’t wait for a joyous moment to photograph and share. Send us instead pictures of stuff you didn’t enjoy.The particularly gruesome bit of wax you’ve just pulled out of your left ear. The turd your dog just did on the mat. Your fat other half slobbing out in front of the TV.Your kids throwing Monopoly pieces at one another after a row over Fenchurch Street station.Instead of sharing your perfect loaf, send pictures of the charred wreck that went wrong, the scarf full of dropped stitches, the wonky self-assembly garden furniture that broke the first time you sat on it.Hit us with the reality of lockdown. Admit that it’s one part happiness and nine parts ditch water.And then maybe teenagers will start to understand that le is bookended by the lucky and the not so lucky.

But hang on.In the olden days – before March – people may well have been on a Tube train at that time because they were coming home from a club.But these days, nobody on a Tube train at quarter to six in the morning is there for fun. They’re ALL going to work.There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what most of us have been told to do all along. But I do agree that commuting on a cramped Tube is bloody dangerous.So I ask once again for parking restrictions to be lted immediately, as this would allow people to go to work in the blissful self-isolation of their own cars.I WAS told this week, by The Times newspaper no less, that this summer’s must-have accessory is a straw handbag.

An officer said only that he was cooperating with an investigation, his brother said.Meanwhile, a spy dossier has claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak. A -page document, obtained by The Saturday , has laid the foundation for a case being created against China for its handling of the deadly disease.It has also been revealed that a laboratory in Wuhan, not far from the now infamous wet market, had been studying deadly bat-derived coronaviruses.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Chinas secrecy surrounding the virus led to an assault on international transparency.It said: Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January .The World Health Organisation does the same.

An urgent investigation was launched tonight into AGO Outsourcing, which had around  staff working on the National Shielding Helpline as a subcontractor of Serco. Workers at the firmaposs call centre in East Kilbride were told “there may be occasions” where bosses cannot keep two metres between them. Yet those taking a £-an-hour job on the helpline - which helps .million vulnerable people in England staying at home - were asked to sign a waiver, absolving the firm of any blamethey get sick. Approached for comment yesterday by the Mirror, a senior AGO manager said some staff spend a whole sht sitting between one and two metres apart. He insisted the firm was following social distancing rules - because Scottish guidelines say there are some circumstances where key workers may sit between one and two metres apart. But after we approached the UK government for comment this afternoon, it asked Serco to launch an urgent investigation within hours. AGO then withdrew the waiver after a request by Serco, a government spokesman said. Late tonight, the government then said Serco had suspended AGO from taking part in the helpline calls entirely pending the outcome of the investigation.  A government spokeswoman told the Mirror: “We take these allegations extremely seriously and have asked our contractor Serco to urgently investigate. We understand they have already asked AGO to withdraw the waiver. We set high standards for our contract providers which explicitly stipulate coronavirus workplace guidance must be followed at all times.”According to the document seen by the Mirror, staff were asked to sign below the words: “I hereby understand that there may be a risk to my health where there is a shortfall in the recommended  metre social distancing. “I also agree that any continuity to work under these conditions are purely my choice and I accept that no liability lies with AGO.” Branded with AGO’s logo and the words “ethics, positivity, passion, professionalism, respect”, the document added: “Whilst we will work hard to ensure employees have all tools to protect themselves, AGO excludes liability for any detriment, deterioration in health or any claims that may arise due to the shortfall in the  metre recommended social distance.” UK social distancing guidelines say people should keep two metres apart to stop the spread of Covid-. But when we approached AGO for comment yesterday, chief operations manager Stephen Rafferty said the firm was following guidelines by the Scottish government.  Those rules say workers must be kept two metres apart where possible, but“the task is essential, the distance between workers can be reduced to no less than one metre.” Mr Rafferty told the Mirror the firm is “very strict in operating within the guidelines” and took “a lot of measures” to keep staff safe - but he insisted that as “key workers”, staff can be kept as little as one metre apart. He also defended the waiver - saying staff knew they would be at some risk when they took the job. One person who worked inside the centre claimed working conditions were “atrocious”. They told the Mirror: “I’m spending all day on the phone to people that are obviously scared and vulnerable, saying don’t you go outside, keep your distance, you are not supposed to see family, you are not supposed to see friends. The insider claimed “multiple people” had complained about working conditions, but many signed the waiver because they needed cash. “Quite a few people who took up a job have been desperate for money because they missed the government’s furlough scheme,” they said. The line helps .million people in England who have been told to avoid all social contact - including those with cancer and cystic fibrosis. Call handlers check on their welfare and whether they have enough food and medicine.  Photos seen by the Mirror appear to show each call handler working in a small booth separated by iders which do not reach the top of all workers’ heads. Mr Rafferty claimed “maybe one, two headsyou’re lucky” stick out but said some people had their chairs pumped up too high. The undated photos also do not show staff wearing masks, but Mr Rafferty insisted masks and gloves are available to all staff. The insider told the Mirror that on the day sht, they had only seen cleaners come round once per day at around pm. Mr Rafferty said this was untrue, and that cleaners came three times a day - disinfecting work stations, door handles, kitchen areas and more. Mr Rafferty said workers’ booths were “just above the metre” apart in some cases. Asked to confirmworkers’ desks and chairs are between one and two metres apart, all day long, he replied: “Some of them are.” But he defended the distance saying people were “fully shielded”. He added: “The guidelines state that that’s what we should do and that is what we do. We’re very strict in operating within the guidelines. We do not breach the guidelines.” Mr Rafferty added the firm “consulted legal advice” before drawing up the waiver, saying: “We didn’t take any existing employees and say ‘ you want paid, you need to work, and you need to sign this so we’re off the hook’.” He added: “Every single person working here has been onboarded specically for this project, so the call centre was empty.

The Tuesday following the late May bank holiday has been highlighted as a possible date for offices, factories and some shops to re-open, according to the Sun. This would allow businesses to get ready to bring in new social distancing measures for workers, such as screens and spaces between desks, designed to prevent any further spread of coronavirus. However, the date could be pushed backthe number of infections has not fallen to a manageable level by this point, the newspaper claims. A Downing Street source told the paper last night that the exact timing is very much a live conversation. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Boris Johnson has promised to set out a roadmap detailing the UKaposs path out of lockdown next week. Business Secretary Alok Sharma is also due to publish nine sector-by-sector papers with guidance on how to protect workers, in industries ranging from construction to retail, from coronavirus. Speaking at the daily No briefing on Thursday for the first time in a month, the Prime Minister announced that the UKaposs coronavirus battle has passed its peak and promised plans to start getting schools and businesses back to normal. He said: We’ve come under what could have been a vast peak, as though we’ve going through some huge Alpine tunnel and we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us. But he also warned that lting restrictions too soon could lead to a devastating second wave of infections.  He said: It is vital we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain. It is understood that the Government fears lting any measures before the second May bank holiday, amid concerns this would encourage people to flock to parks and beaches. Another senior Government source said: You won’t find anybody who thinks it will be any ­earlier than that. Although it is hoped that some sections of the economy can restart in late May, industries such as hospitality and entertainment are expected to remain closed for much longer. It comes as the UKaposs total coronavirus death toll reached , yesterday, including deaths in care homes and in the wider community.

Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, , and husband Prince William, , decided not to find out the gender of their firstborn, whom would become third in line to the throne. Instead they had a list of potential names lined up depending on whether they welcomed a baby girl or boy. And although we know the couple went on to call their son George Alexander Louis, there was another boyaposs name Kate is said to have been particularly fond of. Royal expert Katie Nicholl previously revealed in Vanity Fair: “Courtiers insisted the pair had not found out the sex of their unborn baby, and friends close to the couple claim William wanted a surprise. “Although Kate apparently suspected it was a boy and had set her heart on the name Alexander, they had not yet decided what to call their firstborn.” Ms Nicholl continued: “Kate was reported to have affectionately referred to her bump as ‘our little grape’ while she was pregnant, and there was a flurry of betting on possible names.”  A friend of the couple also told the author: ”When I saw William a few weeks before the birth he said they didnapost know [the babyaposs gender] and didnapost want to find out. He said there are so few surprises in le — this was one he wanted to keep. “Kate said she thought it was a boy because the baby kicked so much. The couple eventually settled on George for their little boy, which hails back to the Queen’s father, King George VI. The Duke and Duchess did however retain Kate’s favourite name as one of George’s middle names.  The little prince is now affectionately known to pals by his nicknames, which include PG, or PG Tips, after his initials. Meanwhile, Kate admitted it ”slightly terrying” becoming a first-time mum in  and standing on the steps of the Lindo Wing hours after giving birth. As she clutched her new baby boy in her arms the clicking of dozens of photographers and their flashing cameras went off.  Speaking about Georgeaposs debut, she told Giovanna Fletcheraposs Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast: [It was] slightly terrying, slightly terrying, Iaposm not going to lie. Everyone had been so supportive and both William and I were really conscious that this was something that everyone was excited about and, you know, weaposre hugely grateful for the support that the public had shown us. And actually for us to be able to share that joy and appreciation with the public, I felt was really important. But equally it was coupled with a newborn baby, and inexperienced parents, and the uncertainty of what that held, so there were all sorts of mixed emotions.  Asked what it was like holding her son for the first time, she said: Amazing, amazing. It is extraordinary as I’ve said. How can the human body do that  It is utterly extraordinary actually. And he was very sweet. And also sort of relieved that he was a happy, healthy boy.

Broghan Hughes from Kirkdale, Merseyside, was diagnosed with the deadly disease in , when she was just two. But despite having to undergo years of brutal treatments, including two bone marrow transplants, full body radiotherapy and numerous bouts of chemotherapy, Broghan never knew quite how serious her condition was. Mum, Gema and dad, David said they “didn’t want her to be in fear of dying”, or be treated dferently by other people. Tragically, after a brave fight, Broghan passed away on April .Heartbroken Gema told the Liverpool Echo : “The last three relapses that Broghan had she didn’t know she had relapsed.She didn’t know she was dying as we were always protecting her. Now that she has passed, we want the world to know how amazing she was. The mum said in the  year battle for her le her daughter never once complained or asked aposwhy me apos The -year-old added: “Nobody knows what she went through, because we wanted to keep things private, but now we can tell people how amazing she was, how much of an inspiration she was, and how hard she fought. “Broghan was just really kind and caring. She would give you her last pound, she was just so selfless. “She was bubbly, she was really witty and funny and she did everything with a smile on her face. “Throughout the  years of fighting for her le she never once complained, never once said ‘why me ’ Broghan, who Gema says always “wanted to be normal” met her best friend, Faith, when she joined Alsop High School in Walton. And the two girls soon became inseparable. Gema said: “When she did go to school she just wanted to be normal. “And when she made friends with Faith, it was just amazing. “Broghan loved and adored Faith, and she loved and adored Broghan.  Following the death of Broghan, friend Faith Mulhall, , set up a fundraising page to help her family. On the page Faith wrote: During our time together we created amazing memories. Broghan was such a special girl who brought a smile to everyoneaposs face and had a heart of gold. You are my bestie for le Broghan and I will never forget you and love you so much. Faith’s mum, Beverley Mulhall, , from Walton said: They did everything together. Faith knew that Broghan had had cancer but they didn’t really talk about it. She knew that Broghan wasn’t feeling very well. “She now wants to raise the money to give to Broghan’s parents, and maybe buy something in memory of Broghan, maybe a memorial.

They could start in the White House with that inadequate ball of self-love telling the American people his genius brain had devised a way to beat the killer virus he first dismissed as a hoax. By injecting bleach into their lungs. Works in a minute, folks. They could look at the mini Stalins running China, who turned into an army of Billy Liars, telling the world not to worry just because a few old folks had gone outside in Wuhan with wet hair and caught a mild case of the snfles. So move on down the ­rickshaw, folks. When asked for advice, the World Health Organisation, petried of losing its funding, pointed at Beijing and muttered “er, yeah, what they said”. Populist leaders like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro urged his people to dance the samba in time to their sneezing in packed shopping malls while Boris Johnson initially decreed we should face it the Eton way by taking the killer droplets on the chin and letting it spread through the lower-class herd. In the face of a man-made disaster they should have seen coming, the supposed leaders of the world were caught in a state of denial. As veteran Tory MP Bernard Jenkin put it: “Some things are so awful to contemplate you just carry on doing normal things. We all knew a pandemic was a top threat. We just hoped it wouldn’t happen.” Chilling words that should convince young people who don’t already get it, that these old world leaders, with short-term interests, are playing Russian roulette with their futures. For the past few years activists have been warning that those charged with protecting the planet either refuse to see the truth about the looming environmental apocalypse or are deliberately ignoring it. Schoolkids were ridiculed for going on strike, Green politicians patronised, Extinction Rebellion vilied and Greta Thunberg became the pin-up hate girl for right-wing mouth-frothers. But observing the same world leaders, who are on the record for refuting man-made climate change and in denial about this man-made pandemic, their fears surely ring true.

At the Downing Street briefing on Thursday, the Prime Minister claimed Britain is past the peak of its coronavirus outbreak and that he will reveal a comprehensive plan on how the nation will get back to work and school next week. However preventing a second wave of deadly infections is vital and professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has warned that We are nowhere near the end of this epidemic. In order to keep the aposRapos - the number of people each Covid- patient infects - below one, any relaxing of restrictions will be gradual. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here  The details wonapost be confirmed until next week at the earliest, but initial reports have given ideas of what le after lockdown could involve. Below we look at some of the major changes that could be headed our way. Back to work by May  Brits couldto work on May  under the Prime Ministeraposs plan to ease lockdown measures. The Tuesday following the late May bank holiday has been highlighted as a possible date for offices, factories and some shops to re-open, according to the Sun. This would allow businesses to get ready to bring in new social distancing measures for workers, such as screens and spaces between desks, designed to prevent any further spread of coronavirus. However, the date could be pushed backthe number of infections has not fallen to a manageable level by this point, the newspaper claims. A Downing Street source told the paper last night that the exact timing is very much a live conversation. Two-metre rule relaxation  Government advice requiring people to stay two metres apart to prevent the spread of coronavirus is being reviewed, according to reports. The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieshas been asked to consider the evidence for asking people to stay so far away from each other, thestates. Although current advice in the UK is to remain two metres from other people, the World Health Organisation advises a lesser distance of one metre. The paper claims that the social distancing rule is now a topic of live discussion as ministers map out a plan to ease lockdown restrictions. Fever tests for commuters  It is understood that commuters may have to take their temperatures before boarding public transport when the coronavirus lockdown is eased. The Department for Transport and Public Health England are considering the measure to prevent the highly infectious virus from spreading on crowded trains when the UK begins toto work, The Times reports. Rail operators are also considering requiring passengers to book ahead for busy services, the paper adds, adding that to reduce overcrowding, commuters would reserve a -minute slot online before boarding. First-class carriages may also be scrapped with passengers no longer allowed to get off at some stations, the paper goes on to claim. Under the proposals anyone with a high temperature - a telltale symptom of Covid- - would be required to stay at home. Other measures which have been adopted by other countries include providing hand sanitiser, asking passengers to wear face masks and signs asking people not to use busy services. Premier league proposals  The Premier League has set a target date to restart the football season on June . If its proposals for Project Restart are approved by the government, games would take place behind closed doors so that the current season can be finished, the Sun reports. Clubs are hoping to restart training in mid-May. No timeframe has been given for when fans will be allowed to attend games again, but they will be banned until at least next season. Matches are likely to take place in a small number of stadiums, such as the Emirates in north London or Etihad in Manchester, with no clubs allowed to play in their home ground. Air travel Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye told PA it would be physically impossible to maintain social distancing measures at airports and that there will need to be better health checks of passengers. He said UK airports should follow countries in Asia which have introduced screening measures, temperature checks and improved hygiene procedures. Passengers may also be required to wear masks during flights. Mr Holland Kaye added: The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. Low cost airline WizzAir has resumed flights overseas from Luton Airport - but British Airways is culling , jobs and Ryanair , as other airlines struggle with the impact of the crisis. Rail travel The Rail Delivery Group is coordinating the rail industryaposs response to the pandemic. It said services will continue to run on a reduced timetable and passengers will be given clear advice about how to stay two metres apart. Changes to travel will be made following the Governmentaposs advice and train companies will remind customers of the action they need to take while using their services.  Great Western Railway has said it is looking to increase services from mid-May, with further increases when the Government starts to ease the lockdown. Elsewhere, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was zero chance of increasing transport services soon, amid speculation of a rise in journeys on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due. Industry sources said last week no dates have yet been agreed or announced. More working from home Many companies are set to keep in place changes they have made to deal with the coronavirus crisis, such as staff working from home, a new study suggests. Research by the Institute of Directorsindicated there will also be a greater focus on digital services when the current lockdown ends. Businesses have been innovating in response to the lockdown, with almost one in six of  firms polled reporting they had launched a new product or service, usually involving hand gel or protective equipment. Property services provider CBRE has said British firms should look to Asia as a guide on how offices might approach reopening in the future. It advises against a full throttleto work, with social-distancing measures needing to be reduced gradually and in line with public health guidance. Pubs and restaurants Major takeaway chains such as KFC, Burger King and Pret A Manger started reopening a few branches this week. They have introduced strict safety and social distancing measures including regular handwashing and sanitising every  minutes. There are also restrictions on the amount of customers allowed in a store at the same time.  Costa Coffee is reopening some branches - only for delivery or drive-thru - and has put in place measures to protect staff and customers - such as new social distancing guidelines, enhanced hygiene procedures and personal protective equipment for team members. Meanwhile, pubs are braced for large numbers of people eager to visit their locals when they reopen again.Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin this week voiced an intention to reopen the chain in or around June.But decreased turnover from having far fewer tables to adhere to social distancing may make opening some bars and restaurants unviable. Shopping In the coming weeks, some non-essential businesses will be allowed to open, it is believed. This includes garden centres and car showrooms, provided social distancing can be maintained. Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has guidelines on ensuring the safe reopening of non-essential firms. Suggestions include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.  The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. Contactless payments would be encouraged and self-checkout stations cleaned regularly. Staff who serve customers are to be protected with screens, visors and gloves. Other measures may include one-way systems through stores, a cap on how many people are allowed in at any given time and security guards at the door.

In the study, scientists from Queen Elizabeth Hospital Foundation Trust and the University of East Anglia write: “We believe, that we can advise Vitamin D supplementation to protect against SARS-CoV infection.”The paper, published on Research Square, states that vitamin D levels are found to be severely low in the ageing population, especially in Spain, Italy and Switzerland.This is also the group most vulnerable for Covid-. It reads: Severe deficiency is defined as a serum D lower than nmol L. In Switzerland, mean vitamin D levels are  in nursing homes and in Italy % of women over  years of age have been found to have circulating levels below nmol L. These are countries with high number of cases of COVID– and the aging people is the group with the highest risk for morbidity and mortality with SARS-Cov. The research has not yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists and only offers up tentative evidence at this point. The authors of the paper also acknowledge: “The number of cases country is affected by the number of tests performed.” Currently the NHS website recommends people consider taking  micrograms of vitamin D per day. It adds: “This is because you may not be getting enough vitamin D from sunlightyou’re indoors most of the day.” But while the NHS acknowledges emerging reports of vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus, it states that currently there is no evidence that this is the case. It also warns people to refrain from buying more vitamin D than they need.

Helen Hartery-Brown, , wants people to know help is out there after she tragically lost her son, Ben, , in the early hours of Monday morning. Before taking his own le, Ben penned his mother a note, explaining that he struggled mentally when he wasn’t on the go. Ben’s family had no idea he was finding le so tough, despite having regular communication with him while he spent the lockdown period with housemates at the University of Loughborough in Leicestershire.  Helen told Gloucestershire Live : “He was on lockdown in Loughborough with two of his house mates from university.“We video called him at pm the night before he took his le. “My last words to him were, ‘I love you millions.’ His last words to me were, ‘I love you too mum’.” The night before he died he didn’t express how he was feeling about lockdown when he spoke to his loving parents. It was only in the letter that he expressed his thoughts. “The lockdown had a massive impact on him,” Helen said. “Ben had not spoken to anyone about how he was feeling. He found it all too overwhelming. “He said in the letter to me he had thoughts when he was at rest and that is why he was a million miles an hour. He was busy all the time because he did not want to be alone with his thoughts.” Helen doesn’t want others to suffer like her boy did.  She wants people, of any age, to tell their loved ones or friends how they are feeling and know they are not alone. “I want people to hear my message when I say that there is nothing so insurmountable that you cannot get help. “Please reach out and get the help and support that you need. “I really do not want another family to go through this.”In the weeks before he passed Ben donated to the charity Papyrus which hopes to prevent people taking their own lives.If there is someone who you feel is considering taking their own lives, you can visit their website to get advice. Ben left behind a legacy of wonderful memories, but there was still so much he had to look forward to, Helen said. She added: “Ben was going to begin officer training with the army in September after finishing at the University of Loughborough where he was studying architectural engineering. “He was always so busy and packed a lot into his short le. “Ben was an intelligent and loving man who left a lasting impression with many people.” Helen said: “My son lived le to the full. He took himself off travelling to Thailand and Vietnam and even went to Madagascar where he volunteered with building projects there. He was always travelling around the country to music gigs too. “I am so proud of him and all that he achieved. He had the whole summer planned before the lockdown.” The family have had hundreds of messages of support from friends of Ben who he had met over the years. His mother said: “He always helped other people. He always made time.

The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieshas been asked to consider the evidence for asking people to stay so far away from each other, the Dailystates. Although current advice in the UK is to remain two metres from other people, the World Health Organisation advises a lesser distance of one metre. Theclaims that the social distancing rule is now a topic of live discussion as ministers map out a plan to ease lockdown restrictions. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Prof Robert Dingwall, a sociologist who sits on the Government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, says that the advice has never had much of an evidence base. There is a fairly solid evidence base for a transmission rateindoors and within one metre of someone with a respiratory infection for  minutes, but that time detail has been lost somewhere along the way, he said. “It is extraordinarily unlikely that any transmission will occur in the few seconds you are standing next to someone as you both reach for the instant coffee. A minister told the paper: This is not about weakening the rules but it is about trying to testit is actually necessary to be two metres. What is the empirical evidence on this  Boris Johnson is due to reveal his roadmap next Thursday on how the UK will gradually begin to exit the lockdown which has been forced by the coronavirus pandemic. At the Prime Ministeraposs first appearance at the daily coronavirus briefing for more than a month yesterday, he declared that the UK was officially past the peak of Covid- infections. He is now set to reveal a comprehensive plan for how the country willto work and how schools will re-open. However, businesses fear social distancing could be a devastating blow, with the hospitality industry the hardest hitthe two-metre rule remains in place. Katie Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality has said that re-opening without a plan of action would be catastrophic for the sector, especiallysocial distancing was to become the norm for the foreseeable future. She said: An extended period of social distancing will mean that many hospitality businesses will not be able to operate fully and many will not be able to open at all. While some experts believe there is evidence that coronavirus does not spread signicantly in the air, others have recommended that people should maintain an even greater distance.

The Great Big Lockdown Survey, launched by the Daily Mirror and other news media, will paint a detailed picture of the extraordinary times we are living through. Britain has never before dealt with a crisis of this nature, a global health emergency that has sent shockwaves through our way of le, our outlook and our economy. So the Great Big Lockdown Survey poses an array of questions about your hopes and fears during the pandemic, your sense of how it is being handled, how your le has changed since the outbreak and how you think it might change on the other side.

He said UK airports should follow countries in Asia which have introduced screening measures, temperature checks and improved hygiene procedures. Passengers may also be required to wear masks during flights. Mr Holland Kaye added: The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. For live updates about coronavirus, follow our live blog. Travellers could also be told to arrive up to four hours ahead of their departure time to allow for extra measures, such as being swabbed and tested for the virus before being able to go through security. Independent aviation analysts have said planes would have to be fully disinfected after every flight, meaning ticket prices could increase. Low-cost airline Wizz Air was to resume some flights from Luton airport on Friday, with passengers required to wear face masks. Crew will also wear masks and will keep a distance between passengers during boarding. Rail travel The Rail Delivery Group is coordinating the rail industryaposs response to the pandemic. It said services will continue to run on a reduced timetable and passengers will be given clear advice about how to stay two metres apart. Changes to travel will be made following the Governmentaposs advice and train companies will remind customers of the action they need to take while using their services.  Great Western Railway has said it is looking to increase services from mid-May, with further increases when the Government starts to ease the lockdown. Elsewhere, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was zero chance of increasing transport services soon, amid speculation of a rise in journeys on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due. Industry sources said last week no dates have yet been agreed or announced. Pubs and restaurants Major takeaway chains such as KFC, Burger King and Pret A Manger started reopening a few branches this week. They have introduced strict safety and social distancing measures including regular handwashing and sanitising every  minutes. There are also restrictions on the amount of customers allowed in a store at the same time. Costa Coffee is reopening some branches - only for delivery or drive-thru - and has put in place measures to protect staff and customers - such as new social distancing guidelines, enhanced hygiene procedures and personal protective equipment for team members.Meanwhile, pubs are braced for large numbers of people eager to visit their locals when they reopen again. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: At this stage it is dficult to say when pubs are expected to reopen and what the future of the pub looks like. We are looking to the Government to provide us more detail on when pubs can go back to business and how they will be able to operate. Our members take the safety of their staff very seriously, when pubs reopen our members will be considering as a matter of the highest priority how to keep staff and customers safe while maintaining the pub experience.It has also been reported that pub landlords may be asked to ration alcohol after the coronavirus lockdown, with a two or three pint limit for customers.The All Party Parliamentary Group for Hospitality and Tourism has also launched an urgent inquiry into how the sectors could reopen. Sport Ongoing discussions have taken place about sporting events restarting following lockdown, with fixtures being played behind closed doors. It has been reported that Premier League matches could be played without spectators for a period of time. Weekly meetings are being held involving senior medical directors of the major sports in a bid toto action as soon as possible.  The issue is also set to be raised when ministers review current measures. Testing, social distancing, hygiene standards and strict limits on the numbers of people allowed in venues would all be debated. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told MPs that he had been having productive talkswith governing bodies from across British sport. Workplaces Businesses could be made to put up signs asking workers to stay two metres apart from one another and instruct staff to leavethey have symptoms of Covid-, it has been reported. Companies will also be told to close communal spaces such as canteens,workers are unable to socially distance themselves, and to ensure there are hand-washing facilities, hand gel and PPE supplies readily available.  Property services provider CBRE has said British firms should look to Asia as a guide on how offices might approach reopening in the future. It advises against a full throttleto work, with social-distancing measures needing to be reduced gradually and in line with public health guidance. Theatres and cinemas It is unclear how theatres and cinemas will begin reopening after the lockdown is lted and firms will need to decide how to maintain social distancing in venues where hundreds of people are in close proximity. Options have included keeping every other seat empty - which could have a financial impact on smaller venues - or checking the temperature of customers before they enter. In the meantime, theatre productions and new release films have been streamed online. Gyms Humphrey Cobbold, chief executive of PureGym, told BBC Radio aposs Today Programme the chain was working to upgrade the hygiene and sanitisation regime to ensure customersapos safety when facilities are allowed to reopen again. He said: The right approach is a considered and careful opening. We will probably, when permitted by government, start by opening half a dozen sites and then expand from there when weaposre confident that we have a model thataposs safe and secure for members for the future. Elsewhere, Virgin Active will inform customers when they will reopen clubs once it is safe to do so based on government advice. Gym members could also be asked to perform frequent hand-washing during visits.  Shopping In the coming weeks, some non-essential businesses will be allowed to open, it is believed. This includes garden centres and car showrooms, provided social distancing can be maintained. Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has guidelines on ensuring the safe reopening of non-essential firms. Suggestions include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. Contactless payments would be encouraged and self-checkout stations cleaned regularly. Staff who serve customers are to be protected with screens, visors and gloves. Other measures may include one-way systems through stores, a cap on how many people are allowed in at any given time and security guards at the door.

The facilities in Manchester were open for the first time since the start of lockdown today, with social distancing measures put in place. It follows a surge in flytipping since Brits were told they must stay at home. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has said councils should be confident to reopen tips as soon as possible - although there have been warnings that protective equipment for waste workers needs to be provided. At the waste centre on Reliance Street in Manchester a queue of cars was already waiting by .am, half an hour before it was scheduled to open. On Saturday only vehicles with number plates ending in even numbers were allowed in, as part of a system to control the number of visitors, meaning some people were turned away. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: While we are reopening centres, this is not ato normal. We would ask the public to limit their journeys and only travel to a household waste and recycling centreit is absolutely essential to do so.  Centres are only accepting bagged general waste and Greater Manchester residents need to show proof of address to use the sites, which are limiting the number of cars allowed in. Mr Jenrick said reopening tips in a staged manner was sensible and the right thing to do. He said: The longer we delay it, the longer those queues are going to be when the waste sites reopen. He said visiting a tip is a perfectly legal thing for people to do, but warned people obviously donapost abuse it.  The minister added: There is no reason why you cannot travel to a tip to put household waste there or do recycling. Councils should have the confidence to reopen them as soon as possible. Councillor David Renard, environment spokesman for the Local Government Associationsaid police would be needed to manage inevitable traffic queues at tips.  He said: HWRCscan only reopen when they have sufficient staffing and social distancing measures are in place to protect staff and members of the public, which remains paramount. To safely manage visitor flow and pent-up demand, the police will need to manage inevitable traffic queues at the sites, with consideration needing to be given to whether supportive measures, such as a permit system and longer opening hours might be needed.  He said it is crucial that staff are given PPE and said re-openings will be decided locally based on risk assessments taken in each local authority area. New research this week showed fly-tipping had increased by % in rural communities during the lockdown. Researchers from the universities of Southampton and Portsmouth said the increase in illegal waste dumping followed the closure of almost all tips, while at the same time the number of DIY projects has increased by householders stuck at home.

They had hoped the PM would announce an easing of Covid- restrictions on Thursday. But the ongoing lockdown means they cannot gather with well-wishers at the war memorial in Rothley, Leicestershire, on Sunday. Instead, they will spend the th anniversary at home with twins Sean and Amelie, , and hold an online vigil with relatives.

She lives in Kensington Palace and travels with the family on visits and royal tours as a discrete presence. Maria is believed to be very strict with the royal children and like all Norland Nannies has a no nonsense approach. There are a number of rules nannies at the Bath college are taught to impose on the children in their care, so itaposs likely that George, Charlotte and Louis have to follow them. Norland expert Louise Heren told the Sun : There will be no messing. Thataposs because Maria will be aware that as they step off planes, holding mumaposs hands, smiling and waving to the crowds, there canapost be any crying or terrible twos or tantrums.

However, a planned change to the May Day bank holiday remains, so there will be a three-day weekend on the th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe. When is VE Day Since  the end of World War Two in Europe has been marked by Victory in Europe Day, better known as VE Day. It falls on May  every year, and  marks  years since the Allied victory of the Nazis. Adolf Hitler committed suicide in Berlin on April , leaving his replacements to see out the end of the war. The unconditional surrender was signed in the early hours of May  , with hostilities in Europe officially ending at one minute after midnight on May . However, celebrations across the UK took place throughout May . This year May  is on a Friday, and the traditional May Day bank holiday - normally the first Monday of the month - has been moved to VE Day . What will happen on VE Day  The bank holiday change was announced last year when a full weekend of celebrations were being put together. Originally flypasts, a procession down the Mall and a plan to turn St James’ Park into Victory Park - giving an idea of what le was like during World War Two - were being arranged.

Passengers took off from Luton Airport wearing face masks and sitting two metres away from each other, Mail Online reports. The Hungarian budget airline has also removed in-flight magazines and brought in new cleaning measures to reduce the risk of travellers getting infected with coronavirus. Passengers are also being encouraged to make all payments via contactless card and to watch a new safety video. Wizz re-opened a number of routes from Luton, its UK base, on Friday after grounding flights due to the coronavirus pandemic. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Among the services which have now restarted are flights to and from Sofia in Bulgaria, Budapest and Lisbon. Many passengers are understood to be seasonal workers planning to help pick fruit and vegetables on British farms. Another plane left Gatwick for Cluj-Napoca in Romania last night. The companyaposs chief executive Jozsef Varadi told the Aviation Week webcast earlier this week that around % of its fleet would be in the air by Friday. It is understood that the company hopes to restore flights to Tenere and Tel Aviv next.  Owain Jones, Wizz Airaposs UK managing director, said: As we restart selected Luton flights to provide an essential service to passengers who need to travel, our primary concern is the health, safety and well-being of our customers and crew. The protective measures that we are implementing will ensure the most sanitary conditions possible. We encourage our customers to watch our new video on how to stay safe when travelling, as well as for more details on our new health and safety measures. Luton Airport confirmed in a statement that Wizz has resumed three routes. The safety of our passengers and staff is our top priority and we continue to rigorously implement all Government guidance, a spokesman said. Air links for both passengers and freight have been recognised as essential services and the Government has asked airports to remain open where possible to ensure they can continue.

Gwent Police in Wales said most people were following advice to stay home, but a small minority selfishly put others at risk. Those who have been caught doing so have been fined, the force said. The revelations come after a Surrey family said they were a making a -mile drive to Cornwall to relieve exam pressure. Some of the ridiculous excuses members of the public have offered include:I’ve been to buy nail clippers for the dog My son is a rubbish cook so I take him food every day I’m taking my quad bike for a walk and I promise I am not going to ride it around a field I’ve just been to feed the fish I don’t watch the news – what’s going on  I’m taking my mate into Newport to buy drugs I thought I heard someone may be in trouble, so I came to have a look but I don’t know their name or remember the person who told me itWe have launched a unique nationwide survey to find out what lockdown is like for people across the country.

A small minority are continuing to go against these guidelines.” North Wales police have had to turn away day-trippers from Snowdonia. Motorists who were stopped near Snowdon in north Wales also conjured up imaginative excuses. They included:I drove from Birkenhead to walk up Snowdon because I was bored I made a -mile round trip to buy CBD oil I have driven from Norfolk aposto exchange a motorbikeapos I have driven from Shropshire aposto pick up a table from mumapos I came from Birkenhead aposto pick up a bedapos It comes after a group of ten tourists in two separate cars were stopped by police on the A in Bethesda, having driven almost  miles in convoy from London to North Wales to climb Snowdon.

Tara Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in Bidenaposs Senate office from December  to August , has accused Biden of pinning her against a wall in , reaching under her skirt and pushing his fingers inside her. Giving an interview to US media while self isolating at home, presidential hopeful Biden addressed the claims publicly for the first time. No, it is not true, he told MSNBC. Iaposm saying unequivocally it never, never happened.  Ms Reade was one of eight women who last year came forward to say Democrat Biden had hugged, kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable, though none accused him of sexual assault. Reade only publicly accused him of an alleged sexual assault on a podcast in March. Biden, , who will be the Democratic nominee to face Donald Trump, , in the November US election, had faced growing pressure from within and outside his party to directly address the accusation. This is an open book, Biden said. Thereaposs nothing for me to hide. In a letter, Biden asked the Secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, to locate and make public records containing any complaint or other documents relating to Readeaposs allegation,they exist.  He said he was unaware of any complaint against him by Ms Reade, and he had never asked anyone to sign a non-disclosure agreement. He said he would not question his accuseraposs motive but did not know why she had made the complaint. In the past Biden has suggested that women making accusations of sexual assault should be given the benefit of the doubt, and on Friday he said he was not being hypocritical by rejecting the charges. Women have a right to be heard and the press should rigorously investigate claims they make, he said. Iaposll always uphold that principle. But in the end, in every case, the truth is what matters. Reuters was unable to reach Reade or a representative for her comment.

He saysyou do the alcohol mouthwash last itaposll remove the fluoride that you just put on your teeth by brushing them, so you should do it first to kill the germs and then finish off with a whitening fluoride rinse.  She added: Apparently the last time he went to the dentist, the hygienist told him he didnapost even really need a cleaning. I was today years old and Iaposve got terrible teeth. A spokesperson for the British Dental Association confirmed that you should always use mouthwash before brushing your teeth - however they advised against finishing up with a fluoride rinse like in the video. They said: It’s essential to brush teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes – last thing at night and at one other time.  It’s important to clean all surfaces of the teeth and gently along the gum line. Interdental brushes are better for cleaning the spaces between teeth than floss, except where the space is too tight to insert a brush. Donapost rinse your mouth out after brushing, as it will wash away the fluoride which makes teeth more resistant to tooth decay -aposspit donapost rinseapos.  If you use mouthwash, use it at a dferent time to brushing, otherwise you’ll rinse away the protective effect of fluoride.

Neighbours in Queensland, Australia managed to devise a cunning way to commemorate a national holiday with some drinks – all while staying within the confines of their respective gardens. Cory Beaman shared a video of their respective ingenuity on Anzac Day, when the neighbours flipped the fence between their homes into a makesht bar counter which they could safely share drinks over while maintaining social distancing. Anzac Day takes place on April th and due to the lockdown restrictions some celebrations had to be cancelled. Anzac Day is a day of remembrance which honours Australians and New Zealanders who have served and died in conflicts. It is celebrated on April  to commemorate the landing of the first Anzac forces in Gallipoli during the First World War. Despite the strict lockdown measures, residents of Cumberland Drive in the Gold Coast were still able to interact without leaving their homes, thanks to this clever piece of DIY.

For me, the club was on its knees.“Not financially or anything like that but morale, the place was at rock bottom.“Everybody was trying to do everything to liven the place up and get us going and get it back to being a happy place for people to come to work.“I think now we are back in a situation where everybody feels part of it. At the minute it is a really good professional environment but there is more we can do to get better.”Despite taking caretaker charge of the final match of the previous season at home to St Mirren, McPake admits his first game as full-time boss at Raith Rovers, a - win in the Betfred Cup, was a big moment.“I was very nervous. It was my first real taste ofmy team – the St Mirren game wasn’t my team,” he said.“This was my first game, our new team’s first game and a lot of new ideas had went into that pre-season.“I was very nervous and probably only settled when the third goal went in.”The Dens boss would go on to miss a home stalemate with Peterhead a week later due to the birth of his daughter.Although it was tough to have to watch from afar, McPake knew he’d left the team in good hands with assistant Jimmy Nicholl and first-team coach Dave Mackay.“I watched the full game from the labour suite,” revealed McPake.“It wasn’t too dficult in the sense that I wasn’t there because, I’ll be honest, family is everything – whether it was a Dundee United game or anything, I was going to be at the birth of my child.“My worry was the baby would arrive when we were up at Coveand I would struggle to be there.“I watched the Peterhead game and I did try to get messages across to the staff, without being too intrusive.“We had picked the team before and for me to be texting from a labour ward and they are seeing the game in real time would’ve been wrong.“The messages I sent were very simple and we had Jimmy Nicholl # he’s played in two World Cups, managed a team that’s won our league and managed a team to a major trophy # and Dave Mackay had managed against teams in that league so we were in capable hands.“We just weren’t good enough on the day, simple as that, and were very flat. That gave us an early indication of what was to come – teams just came, let us have the ball and sit in.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee fc john nelms lifts lid spfl vote u turn","story":"Ever since his deciding ballot ended the lower-league season, John Nelms has been cast, by some, as a sinner in the SPFL vote saga.The Dens Park supremo was front and centre of the crisis that engulfed Scottish football this month after his ‘no’ vote failed to reach the SPFL’s email account and left him with the fate of the game in his hands.Five days later, he switched Dundee’s vote to a ‘yes’, passing the resolution that ended the   campaign in the bottom three isions.Speculation over what sparked Nelms’ change of heart has raged ever since, but the Dundee chief has remained silent.Until today.Finally, in a sit down interview with Tele Sport, Nelms has lted the lid on the events of the last month, and on his hopes for Scottish football’s future – and we are giving his story to you exactly as he gave it to us.George Cran: You stated at the start you were going to vote ‘no’ to the SPFL’s resolution, what were your thoughts on it to begin with John Nelms: From the beginning, I didn’t want anything to go out that would hurt anybody at all. We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/DNic_WeeCook_Barry_Downs-4-scaled.jpg ","title":"local independent eateries weather the coronavirus storm but life post lockdown looks very different","story":"For independent cafes, restaurants and takeaways, le post-lockdown is likely going to look very dferent.The hospitality industry has taken a signicant economic hit in recent weeks many eateries closed their doors to the public not knowingthey would get a chance to serve their loyal customers once more.But there are those, across the country, who have been focusing their efforts on navigating a new #normal#. For some it has meant shting their business to an online model, for others it has meant installing Perspex screens in-store.Yet one thing is certain for all of them # le will never be the same again.We spoke to three local businesses about the true impact of coronavirus.Hayley Wilkes, owner of the WeeCOOK Kitchen in Carnoustie, has focused her efforts on trying to stay ahead of the game so that the business can continue to flourish in the months and years to come.#We#ve tried to stay ahead of the game in terms of anticipating what might happen,# she said.#To be honest that was probably the hardest part in the run-up to the lockdown, not knowing day by day what was going to happen.#In the first few days, it almost felt like we were changing the business every day to keep up with the constantly shting guidelines.#We#ve worked our damnedest to provide a service for the community, not only here for the caravan park # whose residents are mostly vulnerable and elderly # but for the entire community.#But we also had to make sure we were keeping the staff safe. A lot of people were saying, #you should close, it#s the safe thing to do,# but I said, #no, we#re going to stick to guidelines#.#It has been a quick change. We had staff training which was for the opening up of the season and then, within  days, it essentially became survival training.#The staff have been absolutely fantastic. I#ve got three apprentices who are doing the Skills Development Scotland scheme with Dundee and Angus College and I believe they#re some of the only apprentices in the country who are continuing their apprenticeship.#Despite having to rapidly adapt to the changing circumstances, WeeCOOK Kitchen has managed to retain every member of staff.#I had just taken many of them on, with some of them only having worked three shts. I didn#t want to lose them, it broke my heart,# Hayley said. vw, px\"  #I thought, what can we do to keep this business going  Being so small, with the kind of customer base that we have built, we were in the perfect position to adapt, to improvise and to try and get through it # and not only survive but try and have some kind of remnants of a business at the end of it.#If it meant that we had to completely change the way we worked then we would do that.#Already there are things that we#re doing dferently that we hope, once it opens up again, we can adapt. The way that we#re doing business now, we can almost forecast what we#re going to get.#But we miss the restaurant we miss the customers and the interaction and that whole hospitality thing. We#ve been trying to bring it to the customers instead.#After closing their doors back in March, the team quickly introduced a delivery service, which has been a resounding success.Hayley said: #We#ve never done delivery before, ever. It#s a whole new concept to us and a whole new route to customers.#We#ve actually extended and grown our business outwith our local community now. We started by going to the towns and areas where we knew we had a small client base but now we are going further afield. We#re planning to go to Glasgow next week and St Andrews at some point.Assistant manager, Emelye Macqueen, added: #One evening I decided to put it on local Facebook pages and the response was amazing.#The reach went from , to , in the space of  days which is quite an achievement.#So what does the future look like for the hospitality industry  Will le ever revert to what it was before #I don#t think le can go back to how it was,# Hayley said.#It#s already an industry that has been working on such fine margins. For years and years it has always been about cost.#You can#t compete with the big boys and, for a little indie business like ours, it#s dficult.#I hope [when all this is over] that people don#t just get overexcited and go rushing back to the big chains. I hope they remember the small businesses who have kept them going.#The team at Scran Fitness Food, which has been trading for three years, have had to get creative with what they#re offering customers.When Jason Myles first started the company, which now has a production facility at West Pitkerro Industrial Estate and a shop on the Nethergate, his focus was on creating and distributing healthy meal plans.Now, amid the unprecedented coronavirus crisis, he#s introduced home favourites # which they#ve dubbed Scrations # to the menu. These include dishes such as macaroni cheese and steak pie.He said: #The main part of our business is the healthy side of things so it can be quite off-putting for some, especially elderly people.#We#ve had a lot of people messaging us, even before all this happened, asking us about it.#It has been really popular, even amongst those customers who usually order the healthier stuff so its gone down really well and is definitely something that we#re planning to continue.#We threw it out there, just to see what sort of response we#d get, but obviously we#ve been busier than we expected.#We#ve lost the revenue from the shop which is obviously a big hit and we could still open but all the offices in the city centre where our usual trade comes from have closed.#So we#ve taken the decision to keep that closed and work out of the unit for now, focusing on the meal delivery service.#We#ve been probably busier than we would normally be in the healthy side of things but, instead of laying off the guys that were working at the shop, we thought we#d bring them up to the unit and try and get a bit busier so we can keep everyone employed and not have to furlough anyone.#We thought it would be wise to do things that are more appealing to everyone. On Saturdays we#ve been doing something called cheat meals. It’s hot food deliveries from the unit and it#s all your indulgent foods, like burgers and wraps.#We introduced that because we noticed that a lot of the takeaways in Dundee shut so the ones that remained open were getting overrun with hundreds of orders so there were three-hour waiting times.#We thought thatthere was demand for it then we might as well do it. We#ve done that for three weeks now and it has been really successful.#You could just stop and let it [coronavirus] get the better of you but we thought, as long as we keep busy and we keep introducing new things, it#s always going to be popular and everyone needs to eat.#goodeats.io posthouseinvergowriePosted by The Post House Coffee Co onMonday,  April The Post House Coffee Co in Invergowrie, which first opened its doors in November , has swtly adopted new practices to ensure the business is able to continue providing for its loyal customers.Craig Mckenzie, the cafe#s owner, said: #When it was clear coronavirus had reached our shores we took proactive steps like installing hand sanitiser gel for customers and staff and removing some of our tables from the restaurant to give everyone a little more space between themselves and other diners.#Once the severity of the pandemic became clearer we experienced an immediate drop in revenues of %. Cafes were then told to close. We were all absolutely devastated and of course did so # but just for a short period of  days whilst we got our heads around everything.#Since the beginning of the pandemic we have gone from less than % of sales being takeout to now solely operating a click and collect or doorstep delivery service.#We no longer allow customers inside the cafe at all so it was a challenge to work out how to still provide a good service to our valued customers whilst ensuring social distance measures were respected.#For Craig, one of the biggest challenges they faced was the process of furloughing staff.#Retaining our fantastic team and getting the doors safely open again so we had some income was our main priority,# he said.#The process of furloughing some of our staff and bringing the remainder into work was a challenge in itself.#And whilst it has been dficult, there have been some undeniable positives that Craig hopes will continue once normality resumes.He said: #We have always offered an afternoon tea service but with lockdown, and our new takeout and delivery service, we decided to adapt to make it suitable to enjoy at home and the response has been unbelievable.#We have had people ordering separate platters to share afternoon tea over the garden fence with neighbours, friends sending them on anniversaries and entire families ordering it to be delivered to dferent households at the same time to share over Zoom video calls.#We have noticed that everyone seems to be a little more appreciative of each other. We all get caught up in our own lives and,anything, lockdown has given us all time to appreciate others around us. Customers are sending us well wishes with thanks for providing a service during lockdown.#I’m not sure we will be getting back to anything like it was before lockdown anytime soon. When restrictions are eventually lted, I think a lot of the practices introduced and social distancing measures will remain.#I think customers will always want to have a little more space than they did previously, hand sanitiser for customer use will be expected in the cafes and those customers who have become accustomed to having brunch delivered on a lazy Sunday morning will still want it delivered post-lockdown.#A round-up of some of the places offering food delivery and collection services locally\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp a-round-up-of-some-of-the-places-offering-food-delivery-and-collection-services-locally embed # secretlOCQMOfrt\" data-secret\"lOCQMOfrt\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"screen-siren-mae-west-stopped-traffic-glasgow-visit","story":"ldquoCHILDREN adore me, cooed screen siren Mae West when she met a young fan in Glasgow during the heyday of her career."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air , usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in some of the towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing in early-mid August, to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates that the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for this decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, contact the Argyll bird recorder Jim Dickson by email at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"ex-radio-borders-dj-went-rome-become-priest","story":"A Galashiels priest-in-training has spoken to the Borderabout his time in the Vatican and what it was like being filmed by the BBC for a new documentary, which is being aired this weekend.Former Radio Borders DJ Bobby Taylor was in his fth year at The Scots College in Rome when filming for the BBCs Priest School began in September . He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars. Candidacy is the final step before being admitted as a member of the clergy.

The school has an approximate  percent drop-out rate as the young men learn more of what God is calling them to do, and as they face the sometimes hard-to-accept vows which they must take.\"Every guy is dferent,\" said Bobby. \"To be honest, Im not  percent sure  percent is the rate of drop out Ive experienced over the past few years Ive been there. Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions.

to the ldquoBickers Well in Musselburgh.I hadnrsquot heard of this before so I looked into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

They have now been working from home for more than a month and have continued to support vulnerable and disadvantaged young people with ious issues which has brought about some ldquounexpected outcomes.Lynne Anderson, transitions development worker, has noticed that she is able to use her time more wisely by phoning her clients instead of driving up to an hour each way to visit them at their homes.She said: ldquoWe can use this situation to learn how things work dferently. There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph. Wersquore all very proud of the way young people have adapted and how resilient they are.However, there are also issues which have become ldquomagnied during the lockdown, for example, people who have dficult relationships with their family members struggle with being ldquolocked up together over such a long period. Others are affected by less income and need help with accessing food parcels, Universal Credit and other types of financial support.Many young people also need help to deal with the impact the Covid- crisis is having on their mental health. This is particularly the case for those who were already struggling with social anxiety or social isolation prior to the lockdown.Lynne said: ldquoIn the beginning, the young people thought it was fantastic. Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks. This is due to a combination of boredom and too much time to think but also not seeing their friends. They have realised how important those social anchors really are.He highlighted the importance of keeping young peoplersquos motivation and confidence up during these challenging times.He explained: ldquoI remind them that they need to focus on the fact that this will last for a relatively short period of their lives and things will go back to normal.Thank you for reading this story.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/11258293.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Maybe longer.Such a blanket policy surely has ageism at its core, regardless of how well-intentioned.

They accept, hard as it may be, that they wonrsquot be able to leave home. Others wonrsquot have the mental capacity to make these decisions for themselves.But what about over-s that are fitter, healthier and more active than their younger relatives and friends  And what about older people who do suffer from underlying health problems but would rather take a dferent approach once restrictions start to be lted They may decide it is worth leaving home, spending time with grandchildren and friends, going shopping, evenit means an increased chance of catching the virus. They may be willing to accept the associated risks and consequences.Whatrsquos so galling is the idea that no-one over  can or should decide for themselves what risks they are willing to take with their own health and wellbeing.One of most interesting aspects of this crisis has been the way it has forced all of us to examine and question what makes le worth living. Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules.

There has been an increase, in some parts of the country, in road traffic by as much as  per cent. Last weekend in my local park, the sun out and the sky an enamel blue, it was like any summer weekend of picknickers, sunbathers and folk passing on paths shoulder to shoulder.Nicola Sturgeon, in yesterdays daily briefing, put the increase in vehicle journeys down to a straining against lockdown conditions. \"You might feel you deserve it,\" she said, \"After weeks of restraint. Believe me, I really understand all of that.\"Were at around six weeks now and people are missing people, people are missing the things they previously took for granted. They have kept up with social distancing and washed their hands until the skin began to chafe. Tempers are also chafing.Some are in strict adherence to the guidance. Others have let their guard down as times gone on. These two groups dont make for a good mix.And so to face masks. The First Minister this week made the suggestion that citizens might like to cover their mouth and nose when they go to places where a higher volume of people make social distancing dficult, for example at the supermarket or local shops, or on public transport.Just a recommendation, nothing compulsory. That could have been that, but no.The advice until now has been that masks make very little dference and are not recommended. Jason Leitch, the governments National Clinical Director, only at the beginning of April was very clear that wearing masks was not the right way forward.But, as Professor Leitch pointed out, we are in a rapidly changing situation and advice, too, will rapidly change. The issue was not helped by Professor Hugh Pennington appearing on radio and television to say that face coverings are \"very poor\" and offer \"little protection\".Waters were further muddied by constitutional grumbles, at Holyrood splitting in a dferent direction to Westminster. ITVs political reporter was given short shrt when asking Ms Sturgeonthe conflicting advice north and south of the border would be confusing.\"Are you reporting on confusion,\" she lobbed at Peter MacMahon, \"Or are you actually helping to cause confusion \"The wearing of face coverings is a seemingly straightforward piece of advice and not compulsory, so you can sympathise with frustrations over what turned into a protracted discussion.At the same time, the public is being asked to absorb an entirely new lexicon and, for those of us with no science background at all, weigh up entirely new information and come to a choice that, were told, could save lives. Or increase the death rate.There is clearly a moral pressure there for iniduals to do the right thing by making the right choice - and a societal pressure. It was mere weeks ago that we started talking about social distancing and now it has become part of the language asit had always been common parlance.Now were reading about aerosol transmission, hearing about small scale studies into face coverings, being given conflicting advice from prominent scientists then being told we shouldnt feel confused.There are countless suggestions for how best to wear a face covering. how to make them, the best materials to use, how to wear them and how to safely dispose of them. Its a lot of information to process.At the supermarket on Wednesday, I saw no one wearing homespun face coverings and three people wearing medical-style masks. Its obviously a small sample size but the message didnt seem to have immediately prompted action.However, the response I saw online to the suggestion of face coverings was that,its possible they might make some small positive change, people should wear them.Its not the time for widespread public debates about conflicting studies and is the time for unity and collective action. If there is small gain and no loss, then its dficult to argue against getting on board.However, that takes us back to fraying tempers. Bruce Adamson, the children and young peoplersquos commissioner for Scotland, along with a coalition of charities, has written to supermarkets to ask that parents with children are not turned away or shamed by staff when they go for groceries. Increasing numbers of parents are reporting being told to leave their children in the car or being verbally abused by other shoppers.This shows no empathy or understanding for single parents. Or, of course, couples where one is ill, a key worker, or caring for a disabled child at home, and etc.Face coverings risk becoming another cause for friction in public places. Some people will weigh up the pros and cons and choose not to. But not everyone will be able to wear masks - people with autism may struggle, those who are claustrophobic, people with asthma.For deaf people, other people wearing masks makes communication more dficult or even impossible. It can be exhausting for lip readers, for example, to be on high alert constantly to what happening around them.There needs to be an element of trust to our public interactions. We may feel we are doing a better job then those around us of sticking to the rules but there are many invisible barriers that force other people to make choices we may view as wrong.Perhaps instead of rushing to berate someone who skips a queue or walks in your path, consider they might not know youre there. Before shouting at a mother and child in the supermarket, imagine she might prefer her child to be almost anywhere  than in a public place in a pandemic.Were being asked to make personal decisions with the collective good in mind. Some people are careless and selfish but most people are trying their best so empathy, please, for those whose choices dfer from yours.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

As weve developed new ways of delivering tests, weve taken advice from officials as to how this should be counted.\"So, the tests that are within the control of the programme, which is the great majority, are counted when the tests are undertaken in our laboratories.\"But, Prof Newton explained, ldquoany test, which goes outside the control of the programme, theyre counted when they leave the programme, so that is the tests that are mailed out to people at home and the tests which go out in the satellite.\"So that is the way they are counted, have always been counted, and the way we were advised to count them by officials.\"Prof Newton said some , kits sent out to homes were included in the total alongside , tests delivered to satellite locations.Guidance on the Government website appears to have changed on April  to include wording saying home tests and satellite tests were being included in the testing programme.However, Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, said: ldquoLabour has repeatedly called for more testing and increasing testing is an important milestone.ldquoBut many would have expected the , promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because , kits had been mailed out.ldquoTonightrsquos headline figure shouldnrsquot count tests that hadnrsquot been used, or indeed, might never be used as a completed test. Ministers promised transparency the public and NHS staff deserve clarity.He added: ldquoIn any event, this figure was never a strategy. We need a fully resourced testing, isolation and tracing programme and ministers should be using this lockdown time to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats said: \"The Health Secretarys arbitrary target of , tests by the end of April was always a hostage to fortune, and the truth is, he missed it.ldquoItrsquos extremely disappointing the Government have decided to massage the metrics rather than admit they fell short, as this will only undermine public confidence.He went on: \"Everyone wants the country to succeed in beating this awful disease but the British public wonrsquot be so easily fooled by manipulation.ldquoIts deeply regrettable but were still miles off the large-scale testing programme that will be an essential part of any plan to ease out of lockdown through a test, trace and isolate approach.The London MP added: \"Liberal Democrats have long-called for the Government to be frank about what is and is not achievable, to ensure transparency and maintain public trust but ministers continue to play fast and loose with the truth.\"The row came as the latest UK figures showed , people had now died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus, up by  on the day before.The death toll rose as:*the PM is not expected to announce any changes to the lockdown measures before next Thursday, the deadline to renew restrictions*Ryanair said up to , jobs could be lost at the airline while unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to % were also proposed*the head of the Royal College of GPs said half of consultations with patients could move online while urgent cancer referrals had seen a % drop and*Suggestions were made that the Isle of Wight would become the first test and contact tracing pilot area next week with speculation the Scottish islands could follow later in the monthAt the No  press conference, Mr Hancock said the next phase of dealing with Covid- - which will include more community testing and contact tracing - would allow the Government \"to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all\".He explained: \"In recent weeks weve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones and yet our goal must be freedom. Freedom from the virus, yes, and we will not lt measures until it is safe to do so.ldquoBut also, we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too - each citizens right to do as they please.\"However, the Health Secretary said that, for now, people must stay at home while the number of cases of coronavirus was driven down further.He pointed out that , contact tracers to track those who had come into contact with an infected person would be in place by mid-May and the numbers would be increasednecessary.Professor Stephen Powis, NHS Englandrsquos Medical Director, said officials would be studying whether stricter measures would or would not have to continue to apply to the elderly when the lockdown was eased.\"The over-s can be absolutely fit and healthy, its not the case that everybody over  has a chronic health condition or underlying disease,\" he said.\"As we look forward...its a perfectly reasonable question to say how would that work in age groups and age bands \"Although we do know that complications and unfortunately deaths are more common in the elderly even without complications, I think thats for consideration and thats work that we will need to do as we move forward,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-councils-told-use-reserves-155m-support-withheld","story":"Last month, the UK Government announced an additional pound. billion was being handed over to local authorities - with pound million given to the Scottish Government as part of funding conesquentials.But Finance Secretary Kate Forbes is refusing to hand over the money to Scottish councils until she is satisfied with how much they need.Ms Forbes has written to COSLA, the umbrella organisation representing Scottish councils, suggesting that authorities dip into their reserves instead.Edinburgh City Council has warned it faces increased costs and loss of cash of more than pound millionthe shutdown last for six months, while Highlands Council has also stressed it could see an extra pound million added to its financial pressures.The issue was raised by Conservative MSP, Graham Simpson, who told Ms Forbes that local councils were \"hopping mad\" about the situation.:Coronavirus: Edinburgh Council needs radical action to plug poundm pandemic gapMr Simpson said: \"On April , Robert Jenrick announced that councils in England were to get an extra pound. billion to help in the effort against Covid-.\"Scotland would get pound million in consequentials from that - but councils here havenrsquot yet heardthey are going to receive a penny of that money and to put it mildly, they are hopping mad about that.\"Labour local government spokesperson, Sarah Boyack, said it was \"critical\" that councils are given certainty from the Scottish Government.She added: \"They have already transformed their services for our communities and staff through the pandemic, their incomes have already been reduced and they already had existing budget pressures.

But ministers seem determined to centralise control of these funds.\"This is emergency funding which should go directly to councils to help fund social care without any further delay. It is outrageous that the Scottish Government is sitting on its hands.\"COSLA is calling for the money earmarked for local council to be handed over immediately.Ms Macgregor said: \"Council leaders were clear yesterday that the reaction of councils to the Covid- epidemic, ensuring essential services are secured, and that our most vulnerable people are protected has been a remarkable effort and as such the pound million of consequentials should be passed to local government immediately. ldquoCouncils are working hard to keep a huge range of essential services running to meet the needs of communities and to be responsive locally.

Those of us who want Scotland and the wider UK to retain its once flourishing artisan cheeses must show our support for the people who put them on our tables. We need to buy from them now, whether thatrsquos online direct from the producers and specialist retailers, or from local shops and farm shops that are still open. If yoursquore up for this, try to include some soft and blue cheeses in your order.

Her hope was that the imagination could be ldquoa place of shelter for children in the hard months ahead.

The cold hard truth is that Boris Johnson didnrsquot care enough about this virus when it really mattered, and that has made Britain one of the worldrsquos worst coronavirus death-traps.ldquoFor him to now claim some kind of success is a woeful delusion.The stats donrsquot lie, especially when the stats are corpses.Andy Beckett said former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan - in office from  to  - was a charming Tory with a patchy record.Often best remembered for saying Britons had lsquonever had it so goodrsquo, what is often forgotten is that he said it in the middle of a pandemic.ldquoThe pandemic, of a new strain of flu, had started in China the previous winter.

To get the whole picture, we need to pick a few of the iniduals out of the crowd. We also need to speak to the people who werenrsquot at the party, for their own reasons. They are the story too.But letrsquos start with the celebrations. Letrsquos push right into the middle of the crowds and see what it was like. Wersquore in George Square in Glasgow. The evening of May th, . Itrsquos packed. People are dancing jigs and congas in front of the City Chambers. Children are climbing on the statues. Fireworks are being let off. And by midnight itrsquos still going. The pubs ran out of booze in the middle of the afternoon. People are tired and happy but mostly happy. The Glasgow Herald describes it as a fine, robust, and joyful night.There were similar scenes where. In Greenock, there was singing and dancing in the streets. In Falkirk, a pipe band paraded round the town centre. In Perth, the church bells peeled. And then there was London, of course. Thousands headed for Buckingham Palace and Whitehall and Trafalgar Square. The King and Queen appeared on the balcony five times and Churchill spoke from the Ministry of Health building in Whitehall. ldquoIn our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this, he said. It was a festival for the victorious.But back in Scotland, in the town of Bridge of Allan in Stirlingshire, a young woman called Catherine Drummond didnrsquot see any of the celebrations. She had her eight-month-old daughter to look after and she was still mourning her husband John, whorsquod been killed in action. Catherine was  when she married John and  when he died.Mrs Drummond is now  years old and lives in a flat with her daughter, also Catherine, in Dunfermline, and when I call her up on the phone, I ask her about her experiences during the war, about what VE Day was like for her.ldquoI was very sad to tell you the truth because Irsquod lost John, she says. ldquoHe was doing sorties in Europe in Italy. He was up in the air for about an hour and the plane crashed into the sea. Two bodies were found, but two bodies, the pilot and my husband, were never found.Mrs Drummondrsquos husband, who was from Londonderry, had been an air gunner and the young couple had met when the teenaged Catherine was posted to Oban as a wireless operator with the Womenrsquos Royal Auxiliary Air Force she was a WAAF. There are pictures of her in Oban with the sun on her face looking happy, and she was. She did her job and in her free time went to dances, or played table tennis, or cycled. Her upbringing had been strict and restrictive and here she was, independent, fit and busy. A lot of people say it about the war and Catherine Drummond says it too: it was one of the happiest times of her le. She and John married and she fell pregnant.But then: the telegram. It said John was missing, presumed killed. It was August . Catherinersquos baby was born a few weeks later, in September. ldquoIt was terrible, she says. ldquoI got no help and I just carried on. So when it came to VE Day I was sad. John and I had a le planned out, we would go to Canada, but it wasnrsquot meant to be. So on VE Day, I didnrsquot see any celebrations. I was too busy and too sad but in another way I was very glad for all the boys and girls who came home.It took her a while to recover, she says. ldquoI didnrsquot finally give up hope until the POWs came home. I was hoping, you know.After the war, Catherine Drummondrsquos pension from the Air Force was only pound a week so she had to go out to work, and work hard. She did shts in a paper shop from  in the morning until  at night, then went home, had her tea, and went out again to wait on tables. Her parents looked after her daughter.It was a tough le, she says, but thatrsquos it was like after the war. VE Day was not some kind of panacea. Mrs Drummond remembers getting coupons to buy furniture and rationing continued right into the s. I ask her how long it took to get back to normal. ldquoI just carried on, she says.The historian Derek Patrick, who lectures in history at St Andrews University, says this was a fairly typical experience for people on VE Day.ldquoRealistically, there was no sea change, he says, ldquonothing changed overnight. Yoursquod start to see POWs ing to the country but it took a long, long time to get things back on an even keel and towards normality. And there were one or two complaints ndash in Dundee, there was a report about a queue outside a post office and people were described as being in an angry mood ndash theyrsquod come down to draw their pensions and allowances only to find the place closed.The war had also set up an expectation of change in Britain that VE Day could not deliver. ldquoThere was a level of hostility and resentment ndash it happened after the First World War as well ndash that they were promised a land fit for heroes but it was a  dawn, says Patrick. But the change did come in the end. Churchill, to everyonersquos surprise, was not re-elected. A new Labour government came in with new ideas.ldquoAfter years of war, says Patrick, ldquothere was perhaps a determination to see this project through and you can attribute a lot of the changes we saw, like the NHS, to the war.You also have to remember the experiences of people like Catherine Drummond. ldquoLoss was never too far away, says Patrick. ldquoSo there were mixed emotions on VE Day. There was also a very real awareness that the war in the Far East was still going on. This is a moment to rejoice ndash Europe has been pulled back from the precipice ndash but this is only one step on the road to victory.Frank Coyle knows what that feels like. Mr Coyle, from Govan, was serving in the Far East when the war in Europe ended so for him there was little change and even when the Japanese surrendered in September , the fighting went on.ldquoWhen the Japanese surrendered, I had expected it, he says. ldquoBut things did not really change at that point as I was still in action and still fighting. There were many renegades who just couldnrsquot admit defeat. My duties included disposing of weapons taken from the Japanese. You did what you were told.ldquoEventually, I was demobbed after being shipped back home in . The Navy told me I was in debt! I said: lsquoHow can I been in debt  Irsquove not spent anything in two months!rsquo I received pound for my demob payment and a suit. It was a grey, striped suit. And I went home to continue my le.Mr Coyle is  now and was  when he was called up and, like Catherine Drummond, remembers some of the positives of being in the armed services during the war. His early le in Govan had been a struggle ndash he was the main breadwinner for his mother and siblings, working as a delivery boy ndash and, again like Mrs Drummond, he found that le was hard after the war too.ldquoIt was hard to get work, he says. ldquoThey had to take me back for the job I had before the war, but they didnrsquot want to keep me. So, I found work at a foundry. It was very hard work and you had to make a certain amount of castings a day. I did that for  years.Some veterans simply could not adjust to le after the war, such as Jack Patterson. Mr Patterson served on the Arctic Convoys taking supplies to Russia and it was a hard, dangerous le, but when he ed to his village, Thornhill near Dumfries, after VE Day, he found he couldnrsquot settle. So he decided to take up a three-year commission with the Navy. ldquoSo many people were being demobbed at that time, he says, ldquoand I think the Navy was becoming short-staffed.Part of the problem for Mr Patterson, whorsquos now , was that the war had changed his le profoundly, and him too. His family had not been well off and as a child hersquod only been on a train once when he was taken on a school trip to Bellahouston Park in Glasgow. Later, before he joined up, hersquod been working in a factory.ldquoI was glad I joined the Navy, he says. ldquoI was a village boy and I felt I knew practically nothing, but what I learned in the Navy was incredible. The places I got to travel to. Itrsquos an education in itself and you couldnrsquot get a better further education than I got in the Royal Navy. I was a boy when I went in, but I considered myself a man when I came out.As for VE Day, Mr Patterson remembers exactly where he was. ldquoI was doing patrols in the Pentland Firth, he says. ldquoU-Boats were surrendering, and one surrendered to us. We took it to Loch Eriboll in the north of Scotland. It was the first time Irsquod seen a U-Boat. I thought it looked sinister and bigger than I thought it would. It looked sinister because it was all enclosed. We knew at this point that the war was nearly over. Thereafter, we went back to Londonderry, then to Cardf and we were paid off. It was finished.Except that it wasnrsquot ndash not for Jack Patterson, not for anyone. After finishing his duties in the Pentland Firth, Mr Patterson was sent to HMS Illustrious and to Colombo, via Malta and Bombay, and on to Singapore. ldquoWhile en route to Singapore, the Americans dropped the atom bomb, he says. ldquo We didnrsquot know the bomb had been dropped until we reached Singapore and that everything was over.After his time in the Navy, Mr Patterson worked as a postman but the war remains the most signicant experience of his le. ldquoTo me, the Second World War was the most important thing that ever happened in my le, he says, ldquoalong with the introduction of the National Health Service and the European Common Market.This is a constant theme of veteransrsquo experiences: the war transformed their lives and their time in the armed services was often happy, but they were happy too on VE Day, when the war in Europe was over. The historian Derek Patrick points out that people had been anticipating the end of the war for some time because of the collapse of the German forces and the advance of the Allies towards Berlin, and some people couldnrsquot wait to get the party started.ldquoPeople were anticipating it and wondered when do we actually begin to celebrate  says Patrick. ldquoAnd there were sporadic outbreaks of celebrations ndash in some of the smaller towns and villages, you find people celebrating early and jumping the gun a wee bit. On May th, the day before VE Day, the fire service in Glasgow complained about being called out to some  or  bonfires. The service was worried about what would happened on VE Day itself.As it happens, people were pretty well behaved. Some young people were arrested in Townhead on the th for stealing wood to feed bonfires but the celebrations in Glasgow were exuberant and peaceful. In Royal Exchange Square, a Dutch sailor climbed on top of the statue of the Duke of Wellington and did a mocking impersonation of Hitler. He also addressed the crowd and, in broken English, thanked the Scottish people for the brave part they had played in the liberation of his country.And then it was over. The lights in George Square were turned off and people started to meander home. Hostilities had officially ended at one minute past midnight on May th and the party ended at half past one in the morning of May th. But Churchill was right when he said in his speech on VE Day that there was toil and efforts ahead. The war in the East would go on for several more months. And for people like Catherine Drummond, and Frank Coyle, and Jack Patterson, there was the struggle toto normal. What they realised later was, after the war, normal had changed.For more information on VE Day, visit learning.poppyscotland.org.uk VEDay.

Dferent juvenile pairs experienced dferent things: some were given an unrelated adult group mate or material of a dferent colour to the nest in which they hatched or both or neither.Project leader Dr Lauren Guillette added: ldquoBy manipulating their juvenile socio-ecological environment, we could test , as a consequence, zebra finches built their first nest dferently.ldquoUsing dferent material colours allowed us to also determinebirds model their choice of nesting material on the nest experienced as a chick, or on the material they encountered as a juvenile after leaving their nest.The juvenile period was more important: most birds that had juvenile access to material preferred this colour of material for their first nest, but importantly, onlythey had also had an adult group mate.Dr Breen added: ldquoTogether These results show that juvenile zebra finches combine relevant social and ecological cues - here, adult presence and material colour - when developing their material preference.Dferences in the speed at which birds built their first nest were also triggered interactively by juvenile social and ecological cues: Birds that had not had juvenile access to an adult or material were also between three and four times slower at nest building, depending on the building stage, compared to those with access to an adult and or material.Dr Guillette added: ldquoThatrsquos a considerable reduction in speed.The study is published in the academic journal Behavioral Ecology."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-catholic-church-draws-plans-phased-reopening-parishes","story":"It will establish a working group of outside advisers to draw up a strategy that would allow buildings to open again and Masses to .Some of these measures were already in place ahead of lockdown as the Covid- pandemic grew in Scotland.:Amazon Prime launch for documentary into Scots surgeons miracle cure for drug addictionBishop John Keenan, of Paisley Diocese, said the Church has been in discussions with the Scottish Government over issues such as funerals, which have been restricted to immediate family of the deceased.An independent group will now be formed to draw up a strategy but Bishop Keenan said some changes to normal practice will be needed.\"We are not going to ask for our churches to be open when we dont think it is safe,\" he told the PA news agency.\"One priest in a big church looked at social distancing - he had a church of  and he said that the maximum you could get in was , maybe two to a bench for instance.\"He said parishes have been hit financially by the closures.\"Our diocese, we are OK for the first part of the year but the longer it goes on the tougher it will get,\" he said.\"Most Catholics still want to give money to the Church on a weekly basiswe would give them means to do so.\"Some have been furloughed or lost jobs so they might not be able to but a lot have been contacting their parish priest to ask how to donate.\"I think ultimately we will be fine becausewe put in place natural and easy means where people can donate they will do so.\"Other plans include giving those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic an opportunity to say goodbye, as they may have been restricted from being present in the hospital or at the funeral.Bishop Keenan said: \"Every priest I would say has buried someone with Covid.:Half of Scotlands care workers paid less than Real Living Wage\"We are conscious that once the lockdown is over well need to provide means for the family to grieve.\"In a message to parishioners, Archbishop Leo Cushley, of St Andrews and Edinburgh Archdiocese, said: \"Were doing what we can as bishops to speak to the Government and the authorities so that we are exploring how to move forward, what the next steps will be and how to open our churches as soon as we possibly can do so, doing it safely and doing it well.\"A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We are in regular contact with all of Scotlands faith leaders and communities in order to understand their concerns and needs during this time, however, current guidance remains to stay at home and only travel where it is essential so there are currently no plans to reopen places of worship.\"We will engage in further discussion before communities might safely begin to consider reopening places of worship for services at the time it is safe to do so.\""},{"url":null,"title":"home-testing-kits-just-good-drive-in-swab-centres-testing-tsar-says","story":"Professor John Newton said the Governmentrsquos trials of home tests were ldquovery satisfactory amid concern that results from the self-swab kits may not be as accurate.He told BBC Breakfast: ldquoWe know that the testing rates are the samepeople swab themselves as opposed to being swabbed, and wersquove also done some trials of posting them out and getting them back and theyrsquove all shown that itrsquos just as good.:Kevin McKenna: Keep your NHS claps and faux British patriotism.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Billions of pounds worth of gas from Shetland#s Laggan-Tormore Shetland Gas Plant complex pass through Shetland for consumption, where. It is a monstrous scandal that not a single molecule of that is made available to Shetland homes and businesses.Responsibility lies firmly at the door of the SIC. In the interest of their renewable energy hobby horse, for years, they have done nothing to secure incredibly cheap gas supplies for local people and left no stone unturned in their lobbying for Viking Energy. Of course, cheap gas for power generation, homes and businesses would kill the chances of UK consumers paying £. billion for a subsea transmission link to transport unreliable, expensive renewable energy the + miles to SE England, where demand is located.And the result  The devastation of the Unesco Shetland Global Geopark, lauded for its hitherto pristine environment.I#m a stakeholder # and I welcome the opportunity to be consulted. However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist..."},{"url":null,"title":"mechanic coxswain at rnli ","story":"Our purpose is simple, to save lives at sea.

Photo: Dave DonaldsonThe letter was backed by  MPs including former cabinet ministers and shadow ministers and highlighted the importance of local press in communicating trustworthy information and the financial strain faced by local journalists in light of the coronavirus.Mr Carmichael said: “Local press are some of the most trusted sources of news for our communities and we must support them in this challenging time.“They are vital to our efforts to respond and recover from the coronavirus and yet they are facing signicant financial dficulties.“This letter is about getting a fair share of government advertising spend for local and independent press, to reflect both their importance in our communities and their financial needs.“The secretary of state for health has an important role in deciding where these advertising funds go.“If the government takes seriously the need to get valuable and timely information about coronavirus to people in every part of the country then they should get behind this campaign, which is backed by MPs from all sides of parliament.”Among the  signatories were Tory MPs David Mundell, Greg Clark and Michael Fabricant, Labour members Hilary Benn, John McDonnell and Margaret Hodge, Lib Dem MPs Christine Jardine and Tim Farron and SNP members Tommy Sheppard and Philippa Whitford.Good. Yes. But let#s see Alastair also advocate thoroughly for zero hours workers, for parents living in temporary accommodation, for children who are feed from food banks, for people who are now, and who will shortly be living beyond their means,and for the increasing number of people who cannot meet their basic needs. A Universal Basic Income is fundamentally a liberal idea, in as much as people have entitlemment to be spared unreasonable harm. Sowe were to use existing systems to support iniduals, in a responsive and responsible way, possibly at a lower cost than the support now being offered for businesses, we would secure immediate economic stimulus, prevent unreasonable hardship, rebalance the playing field and limit damage to future generations. A heap of thinking has gone into the idea of what rights we each ought to enjoy, the things we should freely have, like affordable transport, and the things we should have the freedom to escape, like hunger. Now is a useful time to be considering such issues, the better for all.An interesting idea, Peter, and one which it may surprise you to learn was looked atseveral years ago by WIr Shetland as a possible policy option for Shetland autonomy.At the time, no country in the world had adopted it however FInland was planning to run a pilot project which it was decided to monitor. I am no longer involved and cannot comment on the current WS situation or policy.After a short, two year trial, the Finnish government decided to end the scheme last year and was reportedly considering alternatives such as a universal credit scheme, similar to that of the UK .Pleased that our MP was pressing the Chancellor on this within  minutes!Always good to see fellow Liberals backing liberal ideas.It is going to be really important to sustain a discussion on the basic rights and freedoms everyone should be able to access now. People should be free from depending on food banks. People should be able to travel freely to access skills training and broad educational opportunities.The UBI can help stop people falling through the cracks, but other ideas are neededall are to be able to live fulfilling lives of their choosing.This is because the cost of being to be able to exercise basic freedoms ies both across the country and from household to household as people#s inidual circumstances so dfer.The Universal Basic Income would help to kick start the economy and would do do fairly, , as Alistair, suggested, the tax system was used to claw the cash back from those who did not need it. Of course that would involve taxing the rich.Little wonder that the Chancellor dismissed the idea out of hand.Permanent State Fund Dividend of Alaska, the same idea. Not bad for a Trump-voting Republican state. Somewhat predates the liberal idea. Just another Red-Necked, Republican, USA idea.Ian,I value your opinions, some of which I agree with, some I don#t.What I don#t value is your judgemental uttering based on your opinions.Wikipedia # #Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but not exclusively applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with rural whites of the Southern United States#Alaska is just a tad north on the Southern states and not all Republicans are white.NB , Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but NOT EXCLUSIVELY applied to white Americans of the Southern States. Sarah Palin, ninth governor of Alaska. Now there is a Redneckever there was one! Alaska is strongly Republican.In response to John Tulloch#s feelgood posturing on Wir Shetlandhaving #looked at# a Universal Basic Income, lets remember this: plenty comparably despicable groups have flirted with all sorts of policies the better to draw folk in.It makes the basic instinct informing Wir Shetlandand John Tulloch#s general political outlook no less reptilian.John derided Great Thunberg at the same time as a global alt-right campaign was launched against her.

I confess I expected a civilised discussion about your perfectly reasonable idea. As opposed to a deranged outpouring of visceral hatred, paranoia, actually. I wish you well.Not entirely surprised by your vitriolic reply to John#s entirely moderate comment and your disdain for the concept of autonomy similar to say Faroes or Falklands etc#but is Chinareally beyond reproach The Chinese Communist Party is beyond reproach # they shut down Wuhan to internal travel and at the same time allowed international air travel out of Wuhan knowing that this virus was highly contagious and that it would spread to the rest of the world.The CCP will only fall when the rest of the world hold them accountable for their actions..."},{"url":null,"title":"museums could open as early as june with social distancing measures ","story":"Heritage leaders hope to open some of Shetland#s cultural sites as early as June after admitting they may have been #overly pessimistic# about the lasting impact of Covid-.Shetland Amenity Trust said recent government announcements had left it  #cautiously optimistic# that some services could resume this summer # rather than the October date previously suggested.Sites such as the Shetland Museum and Archives have been closed since March while all of the trust#s events scheduled for this year including Da Voar Redd Up, Shetland Boat Week, Nature Festival and Wool Week have been cancelled due to Covid-.The trust#s chief executive Mat Roberts said his team had been seeking guidance from professional bodies about how to open some sites while complying with social distancing.Speaking after the trust#s latest #virtual board meeting#, held this morning , Mr Roberts said similar strategies to those adopted by supermarkets could be implemented, such as one way systems, card payments, and a strong focus on hand washing and hygiene.He also said that with little prospect of tourists visiting in the immediate future, the trust expected its customers would be Shetland folk to begin with.#Our market for the next - months is largely going to be the , people who live here,# Mr Roberts added.#We know we have a very loyal market base and we are very grateful for that # we need to make sure we continue to serve and sustain that.#There are no plans to reinstate the cancelled events before next year.The trust has furloughed  of its staff, which accounts for most of its workforce, but hopes they canahead of the reopening.#I want to welcome all of the staff who have been furloughed back, because we need these people to provide services to the people of Shetland,# Mr Roberts added.However, the trust has warned that despite its hopes for an earlier reopening, it still faced uncertainty over its finances.#We are facing very signicant financial challenges because we#ve seen a large amount of commercial income disappear overnight,# he added.#We won#t see the full impact of Covid- until the end of the financial year.#The trust has made applications to ious national funding bodies, but has yet to hear any news.Mr Roberts said that with its commercial activities generating more than £, last year, it left a #very large gap to fill#.However, he said there had been encouraging support from its lighthouse holidays and camping bod guests # around half of whom have opted to roll over their bookings rather than cancel.Once the trust starts to reopen its sites and services, Mr Roberts said it would begin looking at the #revive# phase of the process.Having changed its practices during lockdown, he  said there would be opportunities to continue with the lessons learned.Mr Roberts said the online activities and quizzes had proved very popular # and the trust would also look at its travel and working from home policies.He said the revive phase would not be about seeking to be #bigger and better# but rather #fresher and more relevant#.Although he has revised some of his earlier pessimism, Mr Roberts said he still remained very cautious about the future.#We really don#t know who the future holds,# he said.#There#s so little certainty about what might happen. # raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"shetlands unofficial covid 19 cases estimated at more than 200 ","story":"More than  Shetland folk are thought to be #symptomatic# with Covid-, according to an online app.While the number of official Covid cases and related deaths have remained unchanged for more than a week # health leaders have warned the virus has not gone away yet.NHS Shetland chief executive Michael Dickson has highlighted numbers reported on the #Covid Radar# app, which estimates one per cent of the Shetland population is symptomatic.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3098832.jpg--.jpg?1588153113000\n","title":"check your meter advises consumer council","story":"The Consumer Council is advising households and small businesses to ensure their energy bills are accurate and as low as possible during the COVID- lockdown.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DTUC Chair Niall McCarroll said: The current public health emergency has shone a beacon on the value of the working class, that our class are important and that working class people are the ones who keep the lights on. googletag.cmd.push Traders, hedge fund and private equity managers, the self serving clique are nowhere to be found yet through their bugles in government, the media and endless business chambers they are portrayed as the people who make everything possible, making le possible as in their absence the world would just not exist. A strong radical message needs to be shown - what was once deemed normal, will no longer be accepted. Normality was the problem. Trade Unions across Derry and the North West want to thank the Mayor for supporting our call - by agreeing to turn the Guildhall Clock red on International Workers Day. googletag.cmd.push Anyone who wants a red flag can do so by contacting Derry Trades Union Council on our Facebook page.

Liam Tunney tells the story of the Kilrea man who swapped the cleaver for the canvas and never looked back. Light plays a key role in County Derry artist Conor Larkin’s work, but for years he carried his own talent with such modesty that it seemed destined to remain in the shadows. The self-taught artist has taken the scenic route to turning his passion into a profession and began his working le in McAtamney’s on Kilrea’s Bridge Street. “I didn’t go to art school or anything, I just left school and got a job in the butchers,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I served my time in McAtamney’s and was there until I was  or . After that I did a bit of travelling, went to Australia and America and got that out of my system. “When I came back, I spent some time on building sites and picking fruit. I’ve only really been painting full time for the past five or six years.”  His artistic talent had not gone unnoticed though and was celebrated in the early days by one of his teachers at Crossroads Primary School. “Mrs Magill was the teacher at the time, and she brought my mum in to look at a picture I had painted. I was maybe P or P,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember her telling my mother that the painting was above what I should be doing for my age at that time. “That is my first real memory of somebody picking it up. I even remember what it was – it was a lorry with a sunset behind it. I remember that vividly.” “Even when I was a butcher, I decorated the windows at Christmas and kept painting old milk churns and that to get a few extra pounds. If I could find a smooth surface, I’d paint it. “I would do skateboards and stuff like that when I was at school and I was encouraged by my teachers, but I never took it any further. I was lazy, I suppose. “I ended up getting a job in a glass company and that was the first time I got a job where I was doing something creative.”  Conor’s work at Diamond Glass, in Slaughtneil, involved painting stained glass windows and he began to hone his creative talent, spending more time painting. Even as the shoots of a possible career change were appearing, Conor’s professional radar hadn’t been finely tuned just yet. “Probably the first few I did, I gave them away. It was easy to me, so I just gave them to people,” he said. “The first one I sold was a picture of the Fleadh in Rasharkin. Well, I didn’t actually sell it, I swapped it for an amplier for a guitar. “I had started it, but then realised there were too many people in it and this man approached me and said ‘Look,you finish that, I’ll buy you an amplier for it’. We were playing in a band together. I play a bit of guitar and sing a bit. I still have the amplier, but it probably wasn’t that great a deal when I look at it now!”  Although the talent and ambition were there, there was still the lingering thought that painting was destined only to be a hobby. It took the intervention of a local man to allow Conor to showcase his talent and provided the confidence boost he needed to move things to the next level. He said: “There was a fella in Kilrea called Brendan McAllister, from Edenbane Art. He does a bit of dealing and he askedI’d paint him a few just to see how it went. “I did a few paintings and never really thought much of them, but he came back a week later to say: ‘I’ve sold those, would you do a few more ’ “That made me realise that people were willing to buy them, and it gave me that bit of encouragement.”  If McAllister’s support provided the carrot, the stick came in the form of a conversation with a former butchering colleague, while he was still painting stained glass in Slaughtneil. “It was during that recession when things were getting bad. We were down to a three-day week and the stained glass work was getting less and less. “I got talking to one of the butchers I used to work with. He’s actually a chocolatier now and he said: “If you don’t jump, how are you going to find outyou can do it or not ”  Conor jumped, without looking back. Seven years later there is a -month waiting list for his commissions, requests for which arrive from all over the world. His inspiration though, stems from closer to home. “I live down near the Bann in Kilrea and I’m out on that road a dozen times a day usually,” he said. “There was one day there was a tree and whatever way the sun was shining on it, it got me. I ended up painting it a few times, at dferent times of the year. “Sunsets and autumn light are great. I get fidgety round that time of the evening and I have to get out and get looking at stuff. That’s what I mostly like to paint. “I also love painting old cottages. Sometimes I would drive round the country looking for old, deserted dwellings. I love the way the light plays on the whitewashed walls. “I think everybody has a nostalgic thing for them. Where I grew up, there was an old man who lived across the fields from us and I used to spend time before I went to school over there. “That was the real McCoy, no electricity or anything. There’s a romance about old houses., but there are less of them now. They conjure up memories for many people.”  The Covid- lockdown hasn’t been too taxing for Conor, who doesn’t mind the solitude. It is something to which he has become accustomed. “I’m finding it easy enough because I’m sort of used to it,” he said. “I live out in the sticks anyway so there are days I wouldn’t see a sinner, especially when my we is at work and the weans are at school. “I’m pretty much on my own most of the time anyway, but I do miss being able to jump in the car and head off to the coastI know there is going to be a nice sunset. “I do an online painting demo now every Thursday night from  o’clock. The first painting we did was a few cottages on an old lane and I’m planning to give that away to a key worker. “People are nominating others for it. Somebody on the front line will end up getting that painting. Every wee bit helps.” The Kilrea man carries conversation with the relaxed confidence of a man who has found the holy grail of job satisfaction by turning his hobby into his occupation. “I have done working on building sites, on farms and fruit picking, served my time as a butcher, but while I was doing that, I was always doing the odd wee drawing. “It’s what I’ve always wanted to do. The dream was always to pack in the day job and paint full time, so I suppose I’m living that dream.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The power and panache of Gerry McElhinney would have figured prominently in the Kingdom supremos thoughts. This week, Michael McMullan spoke to the all-star forward and former international soccer star. Thank God for YouTube. Gerry McElhinneys wonder point against the Dubs in  was  seconds of bliss. From his first solo until the ball cannoned off the wall behind the Hill  goals, its impossible not to be energised by watching it. For those who remember him playing, the memories came gushing back of one of the games greatest artists. For the rest, it makes us appreciate what a big game player actually is. googletag.cmd.push It was like the parting of the Red Sea, a Derry version of Maradona . He was just outside his own half, but distance was no obstacle It was All-Ireland semi-final day, but Derrys  year-old secret weapon played with expression. Termed by some as a pop star footballer, three months younger than Bjoumlrn Borg, McElhinney was inspired by the Swedes headband. It wasnt a spice-boy image without substance. Derrys sorcerer could also walk the walk. He was a boxing champion in his youth and his soccer career, as a centre-half, took him to Northern Irelands -  European qualier win over West Germany. googletag.cmd.push “It was the fastest  minutes, it just went past in a flash. It was just a game...all I wanted to do was play football,” McElhinney said of that night in Hamburg. He held captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge scoreless and on the periphery. McElhinneys shuddering tackle put down a marker early in the game. For all the stages he performed on, he was as modest as he was magical. No airs or graces, just fanatical about playing. Growing up, playing two games every Saturday and Sunday was the grounding that made him. The  All-Ireland semi-final was just an extension and commentator Michael OHehirs exhilarating tones announced Gerry McElhinney to the nation. He took one solo before thundering through a Dublin midfield who were clutching at straws. An explosion of power careered past four Dublin players. Nobody could get a hand on him. He was electrying. He kept the ball under perfect control, while in full flow. As goalkeeper Paddy Cullen came into view, Gerry squeezed a shot through two helpless defenders before it went over the bar. It wasnt enough to prise Sam Maguire away from the Dubs, but unbeknownst to him, it was another reason for the all-stars to select him in his debut season. “I was fit and I just went out and enjoyed myself,” McElhinney said, from his home in Draycott – between Nottingham and Derby - where he has lived with his second we Val for the last  years. “I was training about six nights a week. When I say it was easy...it just came to me. I learned a lot from experienced men around me, about what to do and where to go. I was no longer a baby, I was coming .” He teased opponents as much as he did the Derry fans, who had to be satisfied with four seasons at senior level. As his soccer career tapered to a conclusion, Fr Sean Hegarty recalled him for the  Ulster championship. He was sent on as a sub to try and save a lost cause in the semi-final with a rampant Donegal. With his head stitched up from colliding into a goalpost, he drove away from Clones that day, heading for Dublin to catch a boat. He was Peterborough bound, where he played his last years under manager Mark Lawrenson. “He was a big loss to Derry, he was talented and as tough as they come. He was a great player, even from a young age – a man before his time,” remembers former Derry manager Paddy Crozier, who played with McElhinney on the  Derry minor team beaten by Cavan in the Ulster final. Another Derry all-star, Johnny McGurk, was inspired by him and mesmerised by his dummy, calling it the McElhinney tip – one Owen Mulligan would later tease defences with. Gerry would win his only club championship in the colours of Craigbane. Their  winning goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin, who would have been directing kick-outs to him, made the comparison to Anthony Tohill. “He was the most complete player I remember, he had everything...until big Tohill came along.” Much water would pass under the bridge first. *** The late Mickey and Annie McElhinney raised their family in the townland of Dreen, outside Park, under the shadow of Sawel Mountain. Gerry is the oldest of , with five brothers , Colm, Kieran and five sisters . “We always played football in the field,” he recalls of his childhood. “The girls were the goalkeepers and the boys were playing out the field. We got neighbours over to play and it was always great craic.”  The family home outside Park Gerry would walk half a mile across the fields to attend Moneyhaughan Primary School, a typical country school with limited facilities, an outside toilet and no football pitch. “There was an old field beside it, but you wouldnt have put cows in it, never mind play football on it.” His early footballing days stem back to his time at secondary school in St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy. “Gerry Burns was the PE teacher and there was a guy Hugh Doherty,” McElhinney states. “He was a teacher, but most of the time he spent playing football in the gym.” Doherty pointed him in the direction of Dungiven Celtic, which started his soccer career. Gerry also mentions his former French teacher Seamus Mullan, who was also a local GAA reporter. “Sometimes he wrote good things about me and sometimes he wrote bad things about me,” Gerry laughs. “Seamus wrote about me because I think he wanted me to stay and play for Derry until the day I died. “Hughiewould take us to the hall. Wed play football and basketball there after school. My mother thought I was never coming home, I was never home to about six oclock at night.” There was no electric at home until Gerrys early teens. The first game he remembers watching on television was the replay of the  FA Cup Final. Having received a full blue kit as a present, he began to support Cha and after drawing with Leeds in the final, the replay at Old Trafford went to extra time. David Webb headed in at the far post from Ian Hutchinsons throw-in to win the cup for the blues. It lit a fire in McElhinney. “I thought I want to play at Wembley and I fulfilled my dreams,” he said, having later played at the famous stadium in Northern Irelands - defeat to England. He could have turned his hand to any sport. A natural, but his Gaelic football career would come first. *** Every Saturday morning in his teenage years, Gerry McElhinney would play for Derry City, before turning out for Dungiven Celtic in the afternoon. He played for Banagher on Sunday and hed squeeze in a game for Dungivens Sunday league team in the morning. “Banagher came first, butI could I would playin the morning. In the evening, we would maybe even have went off somewhere to a carnival and play a seven-a-side game,” McElhinney explains. “That was our weekend and during the week we trained. A lot of players did that. Mickey Lynch and Laurence OKane would have played for Derry City after they left the Irish League.” On the GAA front, Banagher knocked on the door of county finals, but never managed to squeeze into the winners enclosure. McElhinney had signed for Bolton by the time their  defeat to Ballinderry came around and an ankle injury in a soccer game the week before the  decider hampered his progress.  The Banagher squad pictured before the  Derry SFC Final.Gerry is fth from the left in the back row. “I ended up playing corner-back,” he remembers of the decision to start him, in the hope he would run it off. “I borrowed big Liam Hinpheys boots. He wore the rugby boots and I thought it would give my ankle some support.” He didnt last the game and Ballinderry edged home. In McElhinneys opinion, their best chance was against Magherafelt in the  final. “I remember both finals, it pissed down with rain. The Magherafelt game was in Swatragh and we definitely shouldve won that one. “We had three county players – Mickey Lynch, Fintan McCloskey and myself.Seamus Hasson had just retired from playing for Derry. SeamusStevenson was a dual player and played for Derry, so basically Banagher had five county players.” By the time his next championship run came around, he had crossed the county border. His first we hailed from Gortin and he played with the club for four seasons, during his time with Bolton. He wasnt the only newcomer. Liam Reilly – who also played in the  final - also moved to Tyrone and joined Gortin. Gortin reached the senior final in  against Augher, who had brothers Eugene and Dessie McKenna in their ranks and were champions three years earlier. It was Gortins first decider and McElhinneys absence was colossal. He had been known for getting the ball at midfield and rampaging all the way forward before hammering to the net. “I was with Bolton at the time and our pre-season had started, so I couldnt get over,” he said of their five-point defeat. It was time to head back to his roots and his brothers who had joined the emerging Craigbane. In  they beat Loup to win the first of seven intermediate titles, the record in the county. In , they were back in the final. This time it was against neighbours Claudy and Gerry McElhinney was in the team. “I was playing soccer and in the summer, at that time, I came home to visit my family and would stay for six or seven weeks. I played during championship time and won a few Dr Kerlin Cups,” he remembers. Craigbane were seven points down with seven minutes remaining and missed a first half penalty. The title was slipping away, but Conrad McGuigan found the net before player coach Paul Dixon hit a second goal to salvage a draw, - to -. “Tommy White and Charlie Kerrigan were playing, Claudy had a good side,” McElhinney explains.  Craigbanes winning team of . Gerry has his head bowed on the back row Dixon trained them like dogs for the two weeks before the replay. Six or seven sessions were combined with a challenge game with Donemana to sharpen their attacking game. The replay was a dferent story, with Craigbane in control, winning - to -. Gerry scored a point in the game. He later pulled his hamstring, but played on and later went to full-forward, as he picked up his only club championship medal. *** When Derry came knocking in the early s, McElhinney was in his prime. On top of an already bulging schedule, he boxed off and on for two years with Draperstown, under Jim Noonan. He holds a Mid Ulster title and was balancing the spinning plates. He had a spell in Glasgow Celtics reserves while playing at home with Derry minor footballers. Celtic was fitted in around his work, on a semi-professional deal. He failed to break into the first team, but would come for the weekend to play for the reserves. While Noonan urged him to keep his weight down, Jock Stein wanted him to bulk up. “My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney recalls of his time in Glasgow. “I was only  stone  and boxing welterweight, by the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry, I was  stone ...I went from welterweight to middleweight.” In , his first year out of minor, Frankie Kearney called him up to a Derry senior team gearing up for one of of the most successful eras in the countys history. “My Dad lted me at the airport on my way back from Celtic and took me straight to Magherafelt for a McKenna Cup game with Antrim and Gerry Armstrong was playing for them.” The season snowballed into a march to Croke Park. In Ulster, Derry needed a replay to see off Monaghan in the semi-final. They were staring defeat in the face when Eugene Laverty won a penalty that Peter Stevenson scored to give the Oakleafers a second chance. Five McElhinney points and his influence at midfield tamed the Farney men in the replay. In the final with Down, Gerrys early goal set Derry on their way to the first of their back to back titles. Man of the match was his Banagher teammate Mickey Lynch with - to his name. The Dubs ended their All-Ireland dreams, but the following year they retained the Ulster title and were humbled in the All-Ireland semi-final by the Kerry team at the beginning of their golden years. Mickey ODwyer rated Derry as the best team never to have won an All-Ireland. Did McElhinney think they were serious contenders  “We knew we were close when we ran Dublin to a point in the  league final. If we had won that  national league, we wouldve given the All-Ireland a run for it,” he remembers. “It is hard to pick it up after being beat by a point, especially in Croke Park on their home patch. “We had some great players on that team. Anthony McGurk was an all-star by that time. Sean OConnell and Seamus Lagan, sadly not with us anymore, they were all big guns then. “Tom McGuinness, Johnny OLeary and Mickey Lynch...Mickey was my team mate and we travelled everywhere together.” Eight points from Brendan Kelly and a man of the match performance from Anthony McGurk helped Derry to an extra time win over Cavan in the  Ulster final. Derry led by four points after  minutes of the All-Ireland semi-final final, with McElhinney in fine fettle at midfield, against Jack OShea. The Ulster champions led Kerry until early in the second half when super sub Seanie Walsh found the net. The wheels fell off the wagon as the Munster men rattled - in the second half. *** Wins over Tyrone and Donegal took Derry back to an Ulster final in . On the cusp of a third Ulster title and with the Connacht champions to come in the All-Ireland semi-final, they would avoid the Dubs and Kerry until the final. Armagh had other ideas. “Paddy Moriarty destroyed us and we just ran out of steam...that was a bad result.” said McElhinney of their - to - drubbing. He wouldfor the  season. Barring his late cameo in , he bowed away from the county scene. All too early, but his soccer career came calling. Also at that time, Mickey John Forbes ran charity football weekends and players from all over Ulster would play. “They came up from Kerry. It was a couple of times a year and you were getting as many at it, as youd get any many club finals. “There was a hooley after with singers like Susan McCann, Eileen Keane and Philomena Begley. All the top names turned out, it was almost like two all-star selects.” McElhinneys passport was well-stamped and he has been to USA over a dozen times during his career. “If Derry were ever knocked out of anything, I used to just go to America to play Gaelic. I played in New York for Sligo. A Banagher man, Martin Murphy, was manager there and he put me up. “They would fly me over for the weekend to play in Gaelic Park. I always remember the trains going past every ten minutes, alongside the pitch almost. “I played with Cavan in Philadelphia after Armagh beat us. Tom Farrelly was heavily involved in the GAA out there and I worked for him as a landscape gardener. “Tyrone were a big team out there most years with Frankie McGuigan and boys like Brendan Donnelly and Dominic Daly. We played against each other, but all met up and were the best of friends.” The summer of  was his last footballing foray across the Atlantic. “We won the championship in Chicago for Connemara Gaels. I worked out there and played out there. “There wasnt much training involved. They got you work on building sites and there were plenty of contractors out there, Irish guys who were trying to make a buck. “I remember having a car, it only cost me . I parked it up in the car park at OHare Airport and home I went.” Is the wagon still here, I ponder  “It might be,” McElhinney says with a laugh. With the s around the corner, it was soccer time. In part two, McElhinney rolls the clock back on Billy Bingham handing him his debut against the Germans and the trials and tribulations of transferring to the English leagues.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

All of the companys stores have been closed since last month due to the coronavirus lockdown. However, Homebase, which has an outlet at the Crescent Link Retail Park in Derry, has started a phased re-opening of its stores and today said all its UK stores will re-open on Saturday, May . The news was outlined in a statement from the companys chief executive officer, Damian McGloughlin. In March, Homebase was classied as an essential retailer by the Government, meaning that our stores could continue trading. However, with the safety of our customers and teams as our first priority, we decided to temporarily close our stores and operate online only, said Mr McGloughlin. googletag.cmd.push We have taken this time to carefully review and make a large number of changes to our operations in preparation for a safe, phased reopening, in line with Government guidance on social distancing. Following a successful trial across  stores, we will be fully reopening an additional  stores across the UK on Wednesday th April, with strict controls in place to ensure shopping is safe for everyone. Our remaining UK stores will all be reopened for customers to browse and shop from Saturday nd May. It has taken a tremendous amount of hard work and commitment from our teams across all parts of the business, to ensure we are ready to safely welcome customers back through our doors. googletag.cmd.push Im extremely grateful for the dedication shown by every single team member, and to our customers, for the huge support and understanding.

The -strong group managed to raise pound, after abseiling down the Tower Museum building in Derry in the inaugural charity event at the beginning of March. Money raised from the event will go towards the pound million per year cost associated with running the le-saving Helicopter Emergency Medical Service . HEMS paramedic Jason Rosborough was among those who took part in the event and said the funds were vital to the running of the service. “As a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep us in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland,” said the Eglinton native. googletag.cmd.push “With the sponsorship raised for taking on this exciting challenge, we have all done our bit to raise much needed funds for Air Ambulance NI.” Earlier this year Jason told the County Derry Post why the HEMS service was so important. He said: “The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. “We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.” The service operates for  hours per day,  days a week and aims to reach anywhere in Northern Ireland within  minutes. googletag.cmd.push Regular donations allow AANI to better predict income levels to keep the helicopter flying and public support for the service is vital. Deputy Chair of AANI, Ian Crowe, has encouraged people to support their membership scheme. He said: “We are so grateful to everyone who took part in the Tower Museum Abseil, I put my fear of heights aside to join in. “The event was a brilliant success for the charity and something we will run again when the time is right. As a charity we rely on the support of local people to keep our helicopter flying. “With the current absence of fundraising events such as this one, I urge anyone who can to donate online or sign up to become a Club AANI member.” Anyone interested in becoming a member can contact AANI via email at info@airambulance.org or visit the website for more information.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

Phase one begins on May  and there are three weeks between each roll back.  In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed. A maximum of four people will be allowed to participate in an activity at the one time. Phase two will permit training, in small groups, but no matches. Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators. This would hopefully mean, from a local perspective, that the Desmond and Limerick District soccer leagues could , while in GAA the football and hurling, club championships, could make a welcometo the playing pitches too. Phase four also allows for swimming pools to open. googletag.cmd.push Phase five, August , will allow gyms, contact sports such as boxing, wrestling and rugby to . There too will be restrictions on large sport gatherings, but it seems that inter county matches in the GAA could be back on the cards in August. It is vital to remember however, that should the virus resurface or one of the phases sees an increase in Covid- cases, there is the possibility that the government would roll back a phase and start from there once more. However, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for sports fans and bodies at this time.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby.

He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I recognised that one right away.Sandra Chapman column : JPIMedia \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I like to think that family le in the wider sense in Northern Ireland is treasured. Being of the baby boomer generation I do remember – just about – those years after the World War Two when my mother’s greatest treasure was her ration books or a visit from a spinster aunt who brought the treats we couldn’t otherwise afford. My aunt, , may have longed for a family of her own but we never knew or asked why she hadn’t married. I wish she was around today because her attention to us taught me, even though I was very young, the value of close family connections and the fact that our parents weren’t the only ones who loved us.I have several nephews and nieces now and I’ve tried to be a caring aunt, but it’s been dficult since I was a full time working mum and had to concentrate on my own children whilst not at work. By the time my children had taken up careers in other countries I tried to concentrate on the nephews and nieces but time was still always against me and they too were scattered to the winds.I have had to wait to what I call my ageing period to make any inroads into my relationships with them and being able to see them even only occasionally is a pleasure. But not now, with this lockdown thwarting me all the way. Family visits are out of the question as my sister reminded me in the early lockdown days when I was sure the odd visit wouldn’t matter. I’ve been fully in lockdown now for what seems an age.I’m certain that is what has revived my old back pain, my occasional bouts of insomnia and has left me looking much older than I should. Definitely. You see it’s not entirely family I’m missing - it’s the hairdresser, the chiropodist, the dentist, the dog groomer , my friends who live near and far, going to the shops and the prospect of not being able to pay a visit to my children and grandchildren - all of whom live in Europe. Boat or plane, it doesn’t matter, neither is available to take me there and equally they can’t come here. I think loneliness may be setting in.Himself is showing signs of impatience – that’s not how I describe myself – because, at this time of year, he would be preparing his boat for the summer sailing season. It sits, alongside a few dozen other boats, wonderingit will get it’s bottom scrubbed and anti-fouled this year before being released into the water amidst cheers of ship-ahoy and back slapping from the launching team.Being deprived of this ritual as, at the time of writing, marinas and harbours throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland - north and south, are closed, is seriously bad for the old-salts brigade. All they can do is look out to sea and pray.We are well warned not to rush out of lockdown but a surprising number of people have run out of patience – not my generation I’m certain – with a sense of entitlement that puts everyone  at risk.One newspaper headline this week declared that ‘lockdown for a year would be a crippling economic blow’. The experts tell us it could cause a second ‘large and deadly peak’. Not attractive choices at all. We can do without those scenarios.Maybe it’s lethargy setting in, but I haven’t got round to ordering food on line as I’m happy enough with our corner shop, I’ll have to leave my hair to grow in its own unwieldly fashion and I don’t intend to fall out with the dog over grooming.

Amid myriad allegations against the DUP and evidence that huge sums were being paid to many claimants, the then DUP minister Simon Hamilton rushed through temporary cuts to the subsidy. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Those January  regulations were immediately taken to court by boiler owners. In autumn  they lost their challenge in the High Court and, more than two years later, their appeal has still not been heard.In the meantime and during the three-year governance vacuum at Stormont, civil servants in the Department for the Economywere left to find a long-term solution.They decided on far deeper cuts than Mr Hamilton, eviscerating what had once been ‘cash for ash’ and making it far less generous than comparable schemes in GB and the Republic.Unsurprisingly, few members of the public were outraged that what had once been an uncapped scheme paying a notional £, a year to the few people running their boilers around the clock had been cut to a maximum of £, by Mr Hamilton and now chopped down to £, – a % drop.But by this stage the stories of genuine claimants who had entered the scheme in good faith at the urging of Stormont had become too loud to be ignored entirely.As the hapless Secretary of State Karen Bradley – who had agreed to rush Stormont civil servants’ changes to the scheme through Westminster – brought the proposals before Parliament, there were awkward questions from MPs and peers.By then it was clear that this was not an attempt to address what had once been a huge overspend – instead, the cuts were so deep that they led to a massive underspend of the money available from the Treasury.Officials insisted that their hands were tied by EU State Aid rules and anything more generous would be illegal under EU law. Yet they had no coherent explanation as to why schemes in other parts of Europe remain jaw-droppingly more lucrative than what they claim is the absolute maximum subsidy.In a concession to the House of Lords, officials agreed thatWestminster would pass their cuts then they would bring in an independent figure to examinetheir actions had unfairly left claimants in financial distress.The man assigned that task was Andrew Buglass, an energy expert from England. For reasons which remain unclear, his report was only published on Wednesday – five months late.Its  pages of findings will have made deeply uncomfortable reading for DfE’s energy ision. Mr Buglass set out multiple examples of how their actions had led to iniduals – who entered the scheme at Stormont’s urging – not only failing to receive any real incentive, but instead suffering signicant hardship.At the heart of the problem is that civil servants and – infamously – the then minister Arlene Foster had given cast iron guarantees that the subsidy rate was unalterable for  years.On the back of those firmest of guarantees, huge loans were taken out to finance the installation of boilers. Many claimants remain deeply in debt – but suddenly found that the supposedly guaranteed income which would repay those loans had evaporated.Mr Buglass found that one claimant had liquidated their pension fund to keep the bank from the door, another had sold a home, another had sold land, others had taken out overdrafts to keep up their repayments – and there has also been a signicant impact on mental health.He said he had been told of “knock-on effects in relationships and families, with recriminations among family members or heated disagreements on what action should be taken as a result” and one man said that “his children had faced bullying in school” as a result of him being a claimant.The evidence which he has collated tallies with that which this newspaper has been reporting for two and a half years.Unquestionably, some of those who entered the scheme were chancers and there is prima facie evidence that some were crooks.But one of the striking things about Mr Buglass’s report is that it records – as I have heard from several claimants – that it is claimants themselves who are pressing for crooks to be found and prosecuted, something which DfE has been exceptionally slow to do.Mr Buglass’s work is doubly embarrassing for DfE’s civil servants because not only does it show that their actions have led to hardship, but it also disproves one of their key claims last year.At the time, DfE confidently said that those with RHI boilers would not revert to fossil fuels because wood pellets are the cheapest form of fuel and therefore it would not make sense.But Mr Buglass’s report – consistent with what this newspaper has reported from claimants and other industry sources – found that contrary to civil servants’ claims, a signicant percentage of RHI claimants to whom he spoke have either reverted to gas or are considering doing so, in many cases because they can bulk buy lpg gas through massive poultry processor Moy Park.Read in context with everything  which we now know about RHI, Mr Buglass’s report suggests that the department which set up RHI and has repeatedly bungled the incentive since that point is still – to this day – unable to adequately run this scheme, despite putting huge civil service resources into putting it right.The day before it released Mr Buglass’s report, DfE released another report which recommended a % increase in the main tarf.That sounds like a lot, but a high percentage of a small figure is still a small figure. EvenDUP minister Diane Dodds agrees to that it would not address the scale of the hardship identied by Mr Buglass.There are only about , RHI claimants and they are easy to ignore. Many of the public will instinctively feel that they were overcompensated at such a high level that they deserve little sympathy now.That ignores the plight of those who entered the scheme because they were environmentalists or they believed Stormont’s promises, and ignores the fact that many of them were running their boilers at a low level. In fact, those who got in early and received vast sums will be fine – they will have in many cases made enough to pay off their loans. Those who claimed the least are now facing the harshest punishment.But this doesn’t just matter for them – it matters for us. At the outset of this scheme some lavishly-paid civil servants blinded themselves with complex explanations around what would have been obvious to the man in the street – paying an uncapped subsidy which is higher than the cost of fuel is disastrous.Eight years on and after all the scrutiny of RHI,common sense and basic fairness are still absent from these calculations, what hope can we have that they are present where in Stormont How RHI is managed is one of several tests of whether this new devolved regime has really changed or whether it’s the same old Stormont with a new face.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

Time is therefore of the essence.ldquoEvery passing hour, let alone day, increases the danger for them and I have made that clear to Mr Raab consistently throughout.ldquoBut frankly, his conduct in the judicial review has been nothing short of disgraceful.ldquoHis whole attitude throughout the case so far has been of a school yard bully, making threats to the parents of bankruptcythey brought the case at all and attempting to harass them at every step along the way refusing to give them the information they are entitled to.Mr Seiger continued: ldquoHe has hired four top barristers to run the case for him and there are numerous lawyers in the Government legal department behind him too.ldquoBetween them all, all they have managed to do so far is to conspire with him to engage in a scandalous attempted cover up of the truth, when the very opposite should be happening.

He was also a big figure in all our lives and I would like to extend a special welcome to Tony’s we Mary, to his sons Stephen and Conor, to his daughters Cathy and Laura.“Tony’s death was not unexpected but even so there are just no easy words we can say to take away the pain.“It is a time of heartache, a time of tears. All we can do today is be whatever comfort we can to you at this dficult time.“Anyone who knew Tony ‘Archie’ Moore will know that he loved the social event of a big Wake and attended many a funeral in his day and yet here we are with just his family and a few friends here in this church.“It seems so surreal but as you all know we are living in strange times due to the restrictions imposed on us by the Coronavirus pandemic.“If these were normal times, this church would be overflowing such was Tony’s popularity.“He was first and foremost a giant of the community and the irony is, as much as he would have loved a big send off, he would have wanted us to do our best to respect the guidelines, to keep people safe and healthy at this unusual time.“Thanks to the wonders of technology, many of you in the community are watching online.”He also welcome members of Tony’s family from Australia who are also watching online.“We were all deeply saddened that Tony has left us and it is dficult to let go of the man we came to know and love.“We are privileged to be able to gather together as his family and friends here and online to pray for him.“Someone once said everyone gets to preach at their own funeral by the way they lived their le.“Well knowing Tony as I did, the man he was I believe he will preach very well.”He refered to the Gospel which was on the Beatitudes and said Tony was ‘keenly aware’ of all the blessings.“Those quality Jesus mentions became a lived reality for him.“He was keenly aware of all of the blessings God had given him and he was proud to share them with everyone he knew.“Today we mourn the death of Tony but we also celebrate a le well lived.“Tony was a man who loved le. His family was incredibly important to him and was one of the things that distinguished him and helped define who he was as a man. He loved his we Mary, his children and his grandchildren. There is nothing he wouldn’t do for them. The pain upon us is real but so is the joy.“Each one of you here and each one of you watching online have a story to tell about Tony. “We can look back at the times when Tony was so kind to so many, brightened and enriched lives.“We can see in him love through his love for others. We can see in him compassion, honesty, integrity and courtesy and how everyone was special to him. We can see in him his wonderful sense of humour. his smile and infectious laugh which lted all our spirits.”He spoke of how fondly people spoke of Tony on Facebook, describing him as ‘an absolute gentleman’.“He always had time for everbody. He was generous to a fault, always the first to give. He was a superb neighbour. He was one of le’s real gems. He was one of le’s good guys. He was always fun-loving. He was a great man to know. He never passed you by. Always ready for a chat. He was a wonderful human being and a real friend to all who knew him. He was one of the nicest people put on this earth.“These are just some of the hundreds of comments posted on Facebook. Comments from so many who will feel his loss keenly because of the person he was and with his unique gts he touched all our lives.“Tony was indeed a person who had a great abundance of humanity. He cared about people all his le.“He was born in Shankill in Lurgan whre he grew up but he would spend most of his le living in Craigavon.“He started his working career with Farrens then went to work in the Goodyear factory when it opened in  til its closure.“He was one of the founding members of the Goodyear Sports and Social Club and he will be remembered by many as the ‘Captain of the Ship’ at the Goodyear SSC where he facilitated s that raised thousands of pounds for charities.“He loved and enjoyed the craic and banter with all the people who came through the door over the years.“Tony had a great love for young people and when he was younger he worked as a volunteer youth leader for many years.“He was also a keen supporter of Armagh, Clan na Gael and Eire Og. He loved the GAA. He was a true Gael.“Tony Moore was truly special and that came from something within. And that something was his faith. Tony was a man of immense faith. He embraced his Catholic faith. His whole le was founded on a deep unshakeable faith.“I had the privilege of knowing Tony.
