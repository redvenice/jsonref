similarly bleak life expectancy picture among women, where the gap is now eight years between England\u0027s most and least deprived areas.Among women in Westminster life expectancy was 82.3 years by 2003, before rising to 87.1 years by 2020.But in Blackpool it was 78.4 years by 2003, and 79 years almost two decades later. A comparison between the areas with the highest and lowest life expectancies among men twenty years ago and today reveals a similar picture.In 2001 to 2003 the biggest gap among men was 8.2 years between Hart, in Hampshire, and Manchester, in the north west.But by 2018 to 2020 the biggest gap was 10.7 years between Westminster and Blackpool.The data for the King\u0027s Fund analysis comes from an Office for National Statistics report looking into disparities in life expectancy between regions.It showed life expectancy among men grew in the South East and South West between 2015 and 2020, but fell in every other region.And among women life expectancy over the same period only grew in the East of England, London, South East and South West.Life expectancy growth in England has stalled over the last decade, figures show.Between 2001 and 2020, it increased by 3.2 years among males and 2.4 years among females. But just 0.3 years of this improvement happened after 2010. Ms Raleigh said: \u0027These inequalities have become institutionalised. \u0027They symbolise and are the product of wider socio-economic inequalities, with devastating impacts on iniduals, their families and communities, and a waste of human and social capital.\u0027If the Secretary of State’s call that it is time to level up in health is to mean anything, the OHID (Office for Health Improvement and Disparities) will need to take a multifocal lens to addressing the many and cross-cutting dimensions of inequality, its challenges made greater by the fall in life expectancy to 2010 levels and exacerbation of inequalities caused by the Covid pandemic.\u0027Mr Javid used a recent keynote speech in Blackpool on \u0027levelling up\u0027 health to pledge to tackle \u0027the disease of disparity\u0027.Boris Johnson said in his speech at Conservative Party Conference last week that levelling up was \u0027the greatest project that any Government can embark on\u0027.The Prime Minister pledged his team would \u0027get on with our job of uniting and levelling up across the UK\u0027, and made it his mission to solve the country\u0027s \u0027imbalanced society\u0027 to \u0027promote opportunity with every tool we have\u0027.  The Department of Health said: \u0027Covid has exposed fractures and inequalities within our health and care system, and in many places the pandemic has deepened them.\u0027This Government is committed to levelling up from the pandemic and the new Office for Health Improvement and Disparities will drive the mission to tackle health inequalities.\u0027The OHID opened at the start of this month with the explicit aim of tackling health inequalities across the country.The analysis was based on the Office for National Statistics\u0027 National life tables report and life expectancy for local areas report published last month. The figures were published by the King\u0027s Fund in a blog post.  Ten years’ longer life expectancy for men in the richest areas | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Florida trooper dodges control

drive away in the village of Benahavis, British expats and holidaymakers were enjoying al fresco lunches under a cloudless blue sky.It was not clear today when Boris and his family will stay in the area until, although they are expected to fly back to Britain on Wednesday.Torre de Tramores boasts on its website: \u0027What sets this exclusive and private getaway apart is the quality and authenticity of its antiques and furnishings, along with the natural splendour and historical atmosphere of its environment.\u0027With its understated elegance and rustic charm, the Tramores estate offers the perfect retreat to unwind, meditate and be inspired, or entertain family and friends.\u0027 Guests are invited to \u0027find some old-fashioned romance amid rambling vines and sun-kissed stone walls\u0027 in an official estate publicity brochure available online.The owners describe it as the \u0027most enchanting, picturesque and serene private estate in southern Spain.\u0027Tennis fan Mr Johnson, who went on a health kick after coronavirus nearly killed him last year, could also take advantage of the estate\u0027s court. Local paper Diario Sur, citing well-placed sources, confirmed today Boris Johnson and his family were staying at the estate, which has also played host to Hugh Grant.  Boris\u0027 trip to the Mediterranean coast comes as Britain faces several crises which have been described as a \u0027winter of discontent\u0027.While the Marbella sunshine hit 75C, back at home there were fears of a winter chill as millions face soaring energy bills.Energy supplier Ovo\u0027s chief executive Stephen Fitzpatrick told the Andrew Marr show this morning that gas prices has rocketed by 1000 per cent in the last 12 months.Questioned on the fears Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was unable to guarantee there would not be interruptions to gas supply this winter but insisted he was \u0027as certain as I could be\u0027 it would continue. The escalating costs mean factories in several industries are warning of an impending shutdown. Those affected include manufacturers, food producers and a fertiliser giant that produces CO2 to keep food products fresh.Speaking about Mr Johnson\u0027s holiday, a Westminster source told the Sunday Mirror: \u0027It\u0027s fine the PM taking a break, but the timing shows just how out of touch he is with ordinary Brits facing bills, bills and yet more bills.\u0027However, his allies will argue that his last proper break was on the Caribbean island of Mustique in early January last year – since when he has nearly died from Covid, lost his mother, orced, become a father, remarried and prepared to welcome another child, all while dealing with the UK\u0027s gravest crisis since the Second World War. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u0027s former spin doctor, wrote a foul-mouthed tweet about the news this morning, saying: \u0027Marbella? How lovely. F*** business. Slash welfare. Take a holiday\u0027.The former New Labour heavyweight also told LBC this morning: \u0027Everybody\u0027s entitled to a break and you want people in public life to be fit and healthy and focused and my problem with him is that it underlines the fact that he isn\u0027t really focused on the job in the way that he should be.\u0027I think you\u0027d be hard-pressed to say the country is in a very good state at the moment.

The first local transmission of the infection was diagnosed in Codogno, a Lombardy town south of Milan, on 21 February 2020. However, a parliamentary commission set up to investigate the government’s handling of coronavirus will only focus on the period until 30 January 2020, the day before a national emergency was declared. The inquiry will look into the initial outbreaks in countries such as China and the appropriateness of measures adopted by those states and the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contagion around the world. It was originally intended to look more broadly at the government’s response to the pandemic, especially in the early stage as it scrambled to contain rapidly rising infections and deaths. But the cut-off date was imposed after amendments from politicians from the centre-left Democratic party, the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League, which were supported by the commission in July. Thousands of bereaved relatives have signed a petition in recent days to widen the inquiry before its terms are rubber-stamped next week.A total of 201,660 cases were recorded in the seven days to 7 October - the equivalent of 356.6 per 100,000 people. This is the highest figure since July 24, when the seven-day rate stood at 375.1, according to analysis by the PA news agency. Data for the most recent four days (8-11 October) has been excluded as it is incomplete. Two-thirds of local authority areas in England are currently recording a rise in rates, with Trafford in Greater Manchester having the highest rate in the UK, at 832.6. In second place is Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria (782.3), followed by Kettering (775.8) and Wellingborough (735.5), both in Northamptonshire.As Melbourne’s case numbers hit record numbers, one of its most disadvantaged local government areas has also had nearly a third of Victoria’s fatalities during Delta, data compiled by  Australia shows.  analysis has already found areas of Sydney and Melbourne with higher levels of socio-economic disadvantage have recorded a disproportionate number of cases during the Delta outbreak. At the key stages of both outbreaks, many of these areas also had vaccination rates lower than the city average, before authorities boosted access for those communities. “We knew they were going to be at much greater risk,” said Prof Sharon Friel, director of the Menzies Centre for Health Policy at the Australian National University. “If there was a much greater focus on the policy responses, it wouldn’t have played out the way we’re seeing.” Italy has registered 131,335 deaths linked to Covid since the outbreak in February last year.  It has the second highest toll in Europe behind Britain and the ninth highest in the world. The country has reported 4.7 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid - not including those in intensive care - stood at 2,688 on Monday, up from 2,651 a day earlier. There were 18 new admissions to intensive care units, increasing from 13 on Sunday. The total number of patients in intensive care with Covid rose to 374 from a previous 364.The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation said the additional dose should be offered “as part of an extended primary series since these iniduals are less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccine series and are at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease”. WHO vaccine director Kate O’Brien, referring to people with lower immunity due to other conditions, told a news briefing:  The panel also recommended that people over 60 receive an additional dose of the shots made by Chinese vaccine makers Sinopharm and Sinovac some one to three months after completing their schedule, citing evidence in studies in Latin America that they perform less well over time.Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert said her team was struggling to raise the money needed to develop vaccines against diseases already known about, yet alone those yet to emerge. During an event at the Cheltenham Literature Festival with Oxford colleague Dr Catherine Green, Gilbert said her work had gone “backwards” since the pandemic. She said: Scientists believe Nipah virus has the potential to cause a pandemic and recently a 12-year-old boy died in India having become infected, PA Media reported.Sir Patrick Vallance said his job was “not to sugarcoat” the reality or tell ministers what they want to hear, but instead to ensure they understand what the science currently is. He said his “mantra” throughout the pandemic has been that action needs to be taken sooner than it appears to be needed, PA Media reported. In a wide-ranging interview on BBC Radio 4, Vallance said: He said action must be taken “at a time when it doesn’t look particularly worrying”, adding: Paul Givan was challenged by SDLP MLA Pat Catney to introduce a mandatory Covid vaccine certificate. Both Givan and deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, have expressed reservations about the move, stating last week that they would prefer public co-operation with health measures, PA reported. Catney said unvaccinated Covid patients over the age of 50 were five times more like to be admitted to hospital, and urged Givan to “show leadership and make Covid certificates mandatory in spaces where social distancing requirements have been removed ... to prevent a further lockdown”. Givan said the “overwhelming majority” of those over 50 had been vaccinated. He said mandatory vaccine certificates would require the weighing up of equality impact considerations. Catney also asked Givan to confirm whether all the DUP MLAs have received both doses of the jab. Givan said he “regrets this demand to ask people if they have been vaccinated or not”, adding: When Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the upper house of parliament, expressed concern about his health, he said: Don’t worry, everything is fine. They test me practically on a daily basis not just for Covid-19 but all kinds of other infections, so it’s all good. Putin, who turned 69 last week, was seen sitting alone at his screen for the online meeting. He blamed the cough on the cool air temperature and took the opportunity to urge his colleagues to get fully vaccinated, Reuters reported. Russia’s daily Covid death toll is near an all-time high and Putin was forced to self-isolate last month after members of his entourage tested positive for the coronavirus, but the Kremlin said at the time he was “absolutely healthy”. David Malpass, the bank’s president warned the virus had widened the gap between rich and poor nations, setting back progress by years and, in the case of some countries, by a decade. He said one particular problem was the lack of a bankruptcy process to help in cases where debts had become unsustainable. Under the current system, companies can declare themselves bankrupt but countries cannot. Prime minister Mario Draghi’s government decreed last month that from 15 October any worker who fails to present the so-called ‘Green Pass’ will be suspended without pay, hoping to convince “no-vax” Italians to have the jab. The Green Pass, which certifies the holder has either been vaccinated, recently recovered from infection or tested negative in the previous 48 hours, was originally conceived to ease travel around Europe.Meanwhile, a further 28 deaths were reported in the latest figures released this afternoon."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin council chief criticised over snide  to students","story":" Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan told the students’ union ‘it is not the city council’s fault that you appear to have been unaware of how the planning system works’. Photograph: Cyril Byrne  The  The chief executive of Dublin City Council has been criticised for “snide and dismissive” comments to a students’ union that raised concerns over the use of purpose built student accommodation by tourists.In a tweet on Monday, the president of the University College Dublin Students’ Union (UCDSU) Ruairí Power posted a short excerpt from a letter signed by Owen Keegan addressing the issue.“If you genuinely believe that excess profits are being made in the PBSA (purpose built student accommodation) market,” Mr Keegan wrote, “I am surprised the Students Union has not entered the market itself and provided lower cost student accommodation for its members.”PBSA became a controversial subject last month when it emerged planning applications had been seeking changes of use so the accommodation could be marketed to tourists for short term use.The UCDSU and Mr Keegan exchanged two letters each relating to the union’s concerns around the conversion of 571 private student flats into tourist accommodation for the coming academic year.Contacting Mr Keegan on the issue, Mr Power said the union was deeply frustrated at a decision to grant planning that would “undoubtedly perpetuate the supply crisis and artificially inflate rents across the city”.“To prioritise the profit margins of private purpose-built student accommodation providers over the public good is a shameful act which will push young people into precarious living circumstances over the coming months.”In a comprehensive response setting out council policy, Mr Keegan said it had granted permission for a significant number of PBSA schemes and had also received applications for temporary change of use to tourist accommodation.These proposals, he continued, were treated “on their merits” and permission was often granted on the basis of completion delays or “other impediments which would result in part of the complex not being ready for occupation by students at the start of the academic year”.He also noted how the pandemic had affected the level of demand among the student population.“In relation to the particular ‘change of use’ application referenced in your letter the applicant indicated that the majority of the existing bed spaces would remain occupied by students, with additional vacant bed spaces providing overnight accommodation for tourist and business visitors.” Mr Keegan also noted that no objections were received to the planning application.However, dissatisfied with this response, Mr Power said “a rudimentary level” of stakeholder engagement with third level institutions would have identified significant student demand for the current academic year.“A vacuum of leadership from the council executive during a period of significant challenge for students impacted by the supply and affordability crises is most unfortunate.”In response, Mr Keegan told the SU that the local authority was not required to undertake extensive stakeholder engagement in respect of planning applications.“It is unfortunate that UCDSU did not participate in the planning process in respect of these particular applications. However, it is not the City Council’s fault that you appear to have been unaware of how the planning system works.”Mr Keegan declined to comment on the exchange when contacted by The .However, in a post, Labour Senator and party spokeswoman on housing described the part of his response posted on social media as “snide” and “dismissive”.It was “not worthy” of someone who heads up the planning authority, she said, adding: “Dubliners want a vibrant, erse Dublin not just a property developer version of what that should be, allowed to change the rules when it suits them re PBSA”.On Twitter, the Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris rowed in behind the students, saying he fully agreed that the accommodation must be for them.“I have meet UCD SU on student accommodation. The points they make are valid. My Department met with all college management bodies last week to identify solutions \u0026amp new approaches to student accommodation,” he said.Social Democrats councillors on Dublin City Council have called for a special meeting to be convened to address what it described as the “dismissive and condescending comments”."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"An increasingly vigilant public and punishments might help save this crucial habitatStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021.

Of this, €1 billion is said to be available for new spending and €500 million is for tax measures.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has warned that there will not be “something for everyone in the audience”. With families under pressure with inflation and rising energy costs, senior Government figures have been flagging for weeks that the budget will be focused on tackling the cost of living. So what is known? What is in and what is out in Budget 2022?Income taxes and workIt is widely expected that tax relief will be provided in the form of indexing tax credits and bands to help offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay. Fine Gael has been promising such measures for months. Most of the €500 million for tax measures in the budget is set to be gobbled up by this measure. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has also said there will be efforts to promote remote working. At present, employers can give €3.20 a day tax-free to their employees. Alternatively, workers can claim a proportion of home expenses back themselves. The proposal is to update this system with workers able to defray the cost of utilities against the tax they pay.Climate actionThe latest Ipsos MRBI poll shows higher taxes on fuel are not popular – with 82 per cent opposed. But failing a major deviation from one of the key commitments in the Programme for Government, carbon tax will rise by €7.50 per tonne as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per year. This means an estimated €1.28 extra on a 60 litre tank of petrol and €1.48 more for a full fill of diesel from midnight next Tuesday. Increases in the cost of other fuels like kerosene (900 litre tank up €19.40), natural gas (average annual usage up €16.95), coal (40kg bag up 89c) and peat briquettes (12.5kg bale up 20c) would not kick in until May. The proceeds will be spent to better insulate homes, but also to increase fuel allowances for those most at risk of fuel poverty.Social welfare and pensionsAlmost half of the €1 billion available for new spending could be taken up with welfare increases. As mentioned, the fuel allowance for vulnerable households – worth €28 per week between the end of September and April – should rise. It was increased by €3.50 in last year’s budget. With high energy costs expected this winter, don’t be surprised if the increase is greater this year. A key question is whether or not State pension payments will rise for the first time since 2019. Government backbenchers are calling for increases of €10 per week. When asked, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said: “We have said that if the cost of living has gone up, and the cost of fuel, that’s something we’re certainly taking into consideration.” Some increases are a safe bet, therefore.A full Christmas bonus for people on welfare payments was paid last year including to people in receipt of pandemic unemployment payments. The Government will want to announce this if at all possible, but arguments are still in play.ChildcareThere were no measures to help with childcare costs last year . On Friday Varadkar issued the strongest signal yet that help with the costs could be on the way as he confirmed the issue is being examined as the Budget is being finalised.Earlier this week Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman said he hopes to make changes to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) next year.The levels of subsidies for the universal and mean-tested scheme went untouched for 2021. Changes to the scheme are being examined ahead of the budget as is low pay for staff and the sustainability of the business of childcare providers. An extra two weeks of parental leave is set to be introduced from next August. That will bring the number of weeks a parent of a newborn can take off work – supported by €245 payments from the State – to seven.HousingThe Coalition launched its landmark Housing for All plan just last month. It promised the “largest ever housing budget in the history of the State” with “in excess of €20 billion” to be provided – through exchequer funding, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency – over the next five years. Expect some of that to be stumped up on Tuesday. While applications for the new affordable housing scheme are not due to be open until early next year, the existing help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers purchasing new builds will be extended beyond the end of this year.HealthVaradkar promised earlier this year that the up to €4 billion in extra health spending for tackling the Covid-19 pandemic would be maintained next year. That must have been music to the ears of Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly as he entered budget talks and it would be surprising if the €22 billion allocated last year is not matched, at the very least. With warnings that 500,000 people will be added to healthcare waiting lists before the end of the year and the Sláintecare reforms hitting troubled water the Government will not want to be seen to be taking the foot off the throttle in its support for the health system.Cigarettes and alcoholAny increase on the cost of cigarettes is likely to be minimal if it happens at all. Department of Finance officials have suggested a further hike could be counterproductive and may just encourage smokers to source cigarettes from abroad. The Government is reluctant to increase excise on drink given the pressure on pubs and restaurants during the pandemic.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"everything we know about budget 2022 so far","story":"Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath. File photograph: Crispin RodwellThe Government is preparing to unveil Budget 2022 on Tuesday and until this weekend the room for manoeuvre appeared to be limited.Unexpectedly strong economic forecasts over the weekend have dramatically improved the outlook for public finances and could lead to late pressure on the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to go that little bit further.There are still some discussions ongoing around the fuel allowance, for example, but the feeling is that most of the headline measures have now been nailed down.Here is everything we know so far:Budget 2022Tuesday’s budget package is expected to amount to about €4.7 billion, of which €1 billion is believed to be available for new spending with €500 million allocated for tax measures.Income taxes and workIt is widely expected that one of the headline tax measures will involve the indexing of tax credits and bands to offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay. Much of the €500 million for tax measures will be spent on this. There may also be good news for those who are still working from home. At present, employers can give €3.20 a day tax-free to their employees. Alternatively, workers can claim a proportion of home expenses back themselves. It is expected that this system will be updated with workers able to defray the cost of utilities against the tax they pay. If the minimum wage increases in January, an increase in the USC thresholds, to keep the tax burden of those on this wage at a similar level, is likely.Fuel allowancesAs energy costs soar, Ministers are keen to announce a package that would see a rise in the fuel allowance for vulnerable households. It was increased by €3.50 in last year’s budget and the expectation is that it will be a good deal higher this year.Welfare and pensionsThe last time there was an increase in the State pension was March 2019. It is looking likely that there will be a €5 increase this time around and this would bring the weekly payment up to €253.30. Similar pro-rata increases are also on the cards for other welfare payments, again in the €5 range.The Government is keen to direct resources at those who need it most, which will also mean an increase in the qualified child payment but no increase in the monthly children’s allowance payment. A full Christmas bonus for people on welfare payments was paid last year including to people in receipt of pandemic unemployment payments. A final decision on this has not yet been made.Carbon taxCarbon tax will rise by €7.50 per tonne as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per year. This means an estimated €1.28 extra on a 60 litre tank of petrol and €1.48 more for a full fill of diesel from midnight tomorrow. Increases in the cost of other fuels like kerosene (900 litre tank up €19.40), natural gas (average annual usage up €16.95), coal (40kg bag up 89c) and peat briquettes (12.5kg bale up 20c) would not kick in until May.Childcare and parentingA childcare package of about €100 million next year is expected, and this may rise to €200 million annually once ramped up. As part of this fees will be frozen for many parents and there is likely to be expanded access to subsidies for working families and unemployed people.The Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman has already indicated that he hopes to make changes to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) next year and increasing the income limits to access the scheme is one measure under consideration. Other changes being considered include addressing low pay for staff and the sustainability of the business of childcare providers. Separately, an extra two weeks of parental leave is set to be introduced from next August so that parents of a newborn can take up to seven weeks off work supported by the State.EducationDetails emerged on Monday of a budget deal for 1,000 special needs assistants and more than 400 special education teachers. A significant expansion of the Deis scheme was also in prospect while an increase in the Susi student grant for the first time in 10 years has also been mooted.HealthThe Department of Health is set to receive less than €1 billion in direct Covid-19 funding next year, down from €2 billion in Budget 2021. About half of a total Covid-19 spending package of €6.8 billion will be held back as a contingency fund. The renewed focus on medical waiting lists will see a funding package of more than €200 million mobilised to tackle backlogs. Spending on a women’s health package will quadruple to €20 million, while the Department of Health will be allowed to retain some of its underspend to fund more staff increases. It has also been reported that free GP care for children up to the age of seven will be a feature of the budget. Improvements to the drug refund scheme are also on the cards as is a new €10 million package to roll-out free contraception.ClimateMore than €200 million is set to be earmarked for retrofitting in excess of 20,000 homes, with half to be spent on 4,500 free home upgrades for low-income or energy-poverty households. The remainder will be given in grants. Some €360 million will go on active travel measures.Cigarettes and alcoholIt is expected that there will be 50 cent imposed on a packet of 20 cigarettes. Alcohol looks likely to remain untouched as the Government is aware of the pressure on the hospitality industry because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Aviation and tourismA €100 million recovery package for the tourism sector is planned, focused on sustainable recovery, festivals and nightlife activities. The Department of Tourism will also target UK and US visitors with flagship events such as an American Football College game.HousingAn extension to the Help to Buy scheme is expected. The scheme offers a tax rebate to first-time buyers of new homes and is currently due to run out at the end of the year. A key question is whether the Government changes the parameters of the scheme so that the amount a person can claim back is of a lesser amount than is currently the case.PolicingThe number of new gardaí to be recruited is expected to rise from 500 to a new figure of 700.Business supportsThe Government has made it clear that it intends to phase out the pandemic unemployment payment but an extension to the business support known as EWSS will be announced. There are indications that it may be needed all the way up to next summer but Ministers may find a middle ground and announce its extension until Spring.The primary qualifying criteria for the EWSS is that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70 per cent of their previous turnover level and this is unlikely to change. The question is around how the scheme is recalibrated, or whether the subsidy rates change."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"writers should never afraid exercising imaginations","story":"What colour hair has Jane Austen’s Eliza Bennet? In what way is the prettiness of Henry James’s Isabel Archer “unexpected”? As readers, we are given the briefest account of the looks of these imaginary young women. But we are left in no doubt that their creators intended to convey a powerful sense of their allure - and that they succeeded in doing so with a minimum of information about their appearance.Every fiction reader has a vivid mental image of the characters about whom they are reading. Often, that image can be as powerful as the recollection of an acquaintance or friend. Hence the peculiar sense of alienation when film or TV adaptations cast actors who fail to embody our own particular vision of the character (Keira Knightley as Lizzie Bennet? Get away!)So there is something unexpected about the novelist Sebastian Faulks’s recent account at the Cheltenham Literature Festival of how criticism of his depiction of female characters had led him to eschew description of Lena, a principal character in his latest novel, Snow Country. Instead, readers are to infer her physical presence from oblique details.But great writers have always used physical description precisely as it suits their purposes to delineate character. George Eliot’s Maggie Tulliver, tossing her hair out of her eyes with “the air of a small Shetland pony” tells us all we need to know about that steadfast young person. And on recently rereading Anna Karenina, I was surprised to find a detailed description of her appearance: black velvet dress, garland of pansies, pearl necklace and all. “Her charm,” Tolstoy writes, “lay precisely in the fact that her personality always stood out from her dress”.It is unfashionable (bordering on heresy) to say it, but the real issue is not whether novelists should stay in their lane when it comes to depicting experience, but how well they do it. Tolstoy offered a wealth of description of his heroine Austen a minimum. Both are still read with passionate engagement. Thank goodness, then, for the wisdom of Booker-prize winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo, who briskly dismissed as “nonsense” the idea that writers should not exercise the essential fictional muscle known as imagination.A recent correspondence in the Daily  Letters pages has addressed the important topic of pointless biscuits. Rich Tea biscuits, in particular, have been given a hard time for their dreary blandness.It is odd that these characterless discs should be so resolutely tenacious of their place on the supermarket shelf - someone must like them (see also Nice biscuits, those banes of my childhood teatimes). Friends in the West Country, who feed Rich Teas to the cattle in an adjacent field, assure me that they are a bovine favourite.Meanwhile, as any fule kno, Fox’s Party Rings are top biscuit.More from NewsSNP-Green net zero plans ‘could add £800 to home owners’ energy bills’Saudi royal family gifted Trump and team robes made of fake white tiger and cheetah furChina moves to ban all news outlets not funded by Communist PartyPortugal ditches requirement for fully jabbed Britons to have Covid testPictures of the Day: Alpacas stroll through a retirement where residents can pet them as therapyLiz Truss stakes claim to country seat amid property row with Dominic RaabMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains energy policy lose lose exporting carbon emissions","story":"The worst thing about the impending closure of steel works, glass works and other factories due to high energy costs is that in a year’s time the government will be crowing about what a success it all was. Ignoring the lost output, workers laid off, and the depressing effect on Britain’s remaining industrial areas, ministers will look at the figures for UK carbon emissions - which will inevitably plunge as the smokestacks go cool - and say: what a great job we are doing in the fight against climate change.How can I be so sure that the government will be so blinkered? Because that is how ministers already behave. Over the next few weeks in the lead-up to COP26 we will be told ad nauseum that the UK has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent since 1990. What millions don’t like telling us so much is one of the main reasons for the fall: that we have offshored our emissions. We have lost a lot of our heavy industry and are importing a lot more manufactured goods instead – thanks in part to climate policies pushing up energy prices for UK industry way above the levels paid by overseas competitors.The most-quoted figures for UK carbon emissions only include ‘territorial emissions’ - i.e. those physically spewed out within the United Kingdom. It ignores shipping, aviation and emissions from farms and factories elsewhere in the world producing food and industrial goods for UK consumers. When these inconvenient caveats are included, the fall in UK emissions is a lot less impressive: 26 per cent since 1997, rather than the often-quoted 38 per cent for territorial emissions. One of the main reasons for this is that emissions associated with imports from China have soared by 64 per cent over that period. In the meantime, the share of the UK economy made up by manufacturing has fallen from 16.8 percent to 9.9 percent. High UK energy prices, inflated by green levies, are not the only reason for the relative decline of UK manufacturing. Labour, too, is a lot cheaper in South East Asia than in Britain. But they are a large part of the story. Energy-intensive UK manufacturers must pay the Climate Change Levy, the Renewables Obligation and the Emissions Trading Scheme. Following warnings of what these costs were doing to UK industry, the government did start providing some support for energy-intensive industries in 2013. It says, for example, that it has provided £480 million in help towards energy costs to the steel industry alone in the past eight years. Yet it isn’t enough to make up for the huge differential in energy prices between Britain and most of the rest of the world. Electricity prices for extra-large consumers in the first half of 2020 were 84 per cent higher than the median price in the EU.Needless to say, it is easy to force carbon-intensive industries from Britain by jacking up energy prices for industrial users. But to what purpose? It certainly isn’t helping the planet. Close a factory in Britain - where electricity comes mostly from gas, nuclear and renewables - and transfer production to China, where much electricity is still produced by far dirtier coal, and you have increased emissions.What is so depressing is that no political party wants to stand up for UK industry any more. We have a Conservative party which chirps about levelling up communities in the Midlands and North - while driving away jobs by pushing up energy prices. Yet opposition parties want an even faster transition to Net Zero, at whatever cost to UK industry. How ridiculous to hear Labour’s shadow business secretary Ed Miliband this morning complaining about the government’s ‘failed energy policy’ - unless it is a different Ed Miliband from the one who pushed the Climate Change Act through Parliament in 2008, tightening the carbon reduction target at the last minute without any thought as to the implications.In the rush for politicians to prove themselves greener than thou, UK industry sadly finds itself nearly friendless. Meanwhile, emissions on the other side of the world continue unabated. The Denial by Ross Clark is published by Lume BooksMore from NewsSNP-Green net zero plans ‘could add £800 to home owners’ energy bills’Saudi royal family gifted Trump and team robes made of fake white tiger and cheetah furChina moves to ban all news outlets not funded by Communist PartyPortugal ditches requirement for fully jabbed Britons to have Covid testPictures of the Day: Alpacas stroll through a retirement where residents can pet them as therapyLiz Truss stakes claim to country seat amid property row with Dominic RaabMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day alpacas stroll retirement residents can pet therapy","story":"Alpacas stand in the hallway of the retirement home next to a resident going to his room.

He said: I had a lot of people saying they remembered a lot of the items in my house, and that they feel the same way about the s. There was a nice feel to it too, knowing that Iaposm not a weird person and other people enjoy this stuff too. Because I grew up in a small town and I was the quiet gay kid, I always felt a bit like an outsider. He added: In the s, we had enough technology to keep us entertained, but not enough to feel like an overload. Now we have so many dferent media outlets that it can get a little overwhelming. Itaposs nice to have an escape from that. At a push, Iaposd say my favourite item is probably my radio-alarm clock-telephone. Itaposs very mundane, but I always feel a bit glam taking calls from my bedroom. I do love my bedroom though, as once you shut the door, you could be anywhere between the years  and . Of course, Jack loves iconic s girl band the Spice Girls - Geri Halliwell being his favourite member. While he loves reminiscing over music and TV from decades past, his partner Matthew loves dated video games. He has all the original Nintendo consoles. We overlap in our interests there, so thataposs nice, he said. Although he loves his retro decor, Jack admits it ides opinion among visitors. I usually get one of three reactions from people when they come around and see my house, he said. Thereaposll be some people who get nostalgic and remember things from my house from living through the s. Then you get people like my niece. Sheaposs only young so itaposs all new to her and she didnapost believe that my phone or telephone worked. I had to explain to her what a VHS was.  And I get some people who walk in and donapost get it at all. They think Iaposm mad, and theyaposll ask why Iaposm not enjoying what we have now. Jack argues the way he lives is much cheaper and everything in his house has a story.Do you live in a unique house that turns heads  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcWhereas he has received funny looks in the past for donning s outfits, as old fashion styles have come back around people have become more accepting. Nowadays, being dferent is embraced and celebrated a lot more. I donapost feel like an outsider so much anymore. Thereaposs definitely a lot of people online who share my interests. I even met a mate online who has a house that is completely s, he said. As much as he loves the s, Jack acknowledges it would have been tough for him to be a young gay man in the decade. Gay men werenapost portrayed in the media at all, he said, describing himself as someone with vintage interests, but modern values.

Claire Louise Owen, , says she started chewing sponges when she was , and believes she’s suffering from an eating disorder called pica, which makes her crave non-food items with no nutritional value. Claire, from Criccieth, North Wales, said: It started when I was around  or . I worked in a chemist, and I used to want to buy sponges so I could eat them. I like the ripping sensation, putting it in my mouth, ripping, chewing, and swallowing it. Itaposs the texture that I like - they taste horrible. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The cheaper the better and I like the sponge with the smaller holes. Some sponges are the wrong texture, and you canapost rip it. If I have a sponge, I keep it in my bedroom drawer and take two to three bites a day so it will last for around a week.” Claires says she knows her eating habits aren’t good for her, and even feels “relieved” when she’s finished a sponge. She added: When itaposs gone, I feel relieved and stop myself from buying another one. I try really hard not to. I bought one a few months ago, started eating it then threw it in the bin because I know I shouldnapost. I do worry about whether Iaposm digesting it. Claire’s cravings get worse when she’s on her period, stressed, or tired, and they were particularly hard to resist when she was pregnant with her sons, William, , and Sam, . She explained: I think itaposs hormonal because the cravings come and go. At the beginning of my pregnancy it was bad because I was tired, but I was worried for health reasons, so I tried my hardest not to. It gets worse in the stressful times in my le,Iaposm on my period or run down and when I was a teenager, I would pick bits of the sofa and eat it. I wasnapost open enough to tell the doctor, I was really secretive about it.  I havenapost been diagnosed with pica but itaposs something thataposs always been a thing in my le.” The mum – who runs her own coaching business, The Soberholic, where her mission is to “share the benefits of a sober le” – also thinks her addiction could be down to an iron deficiency. And although she still battles with her sponge craving, Claire says she doesn’t chew on the common cleaning item “as much anymore”. She said: I donapost do it as much anymore but itaposs hormonal and my vitamin deficiency. I wasnapost eating it instead of food, it was the texture in my mouth that I craved.

When her cheque was revealed, Kath celebrated by giving her partner of over  years, Alan, a big hug and a kiss. She went on to add: “I cannot believe this, I cannot believe this money! “I’ve been at this postcode for  years – good things come to those who wait!” NG  was announced as August’s Postcode Millions winner on Saturday th August. Kath and six of her neighbours won £, each, the biggest share of the £. million prize, thanks to playing with the full winning postcode – NG NL. Two of her neighbours increased their prizes to £, and £, thanks to playing with two and four tickets.Kath, a retired factory machinist, started sewing scrubs and masks for NHS and care home staff after seeing a request on Facebook. She said: “I knew the NHS needed help so I just did what I could. I made hundreds, they went to local hospitals, doctors’ surgeries and care homes. “It was hard work but it didn’t matter – I knew it was all going to a good cause.” Community-minded Kath also plans to spend a portion of her prize by buying a defibrillator for the local Post Office. She said: “We had a defibrillator that was vandalised and we’ve been raising money to have it replaced but we need more than one, so I’m going to get one for the Post Office.” With four grandchildren, Kath’s biggest plans for her prize involve treating them. She said: “I’ve just called them on FaceTime and given £, away already! We don’t necessarily want much for ourselves and Alan has Parkinson’s so we won’t be going on a big holiday, instead we’ll do what we can to help others.” Kath went on to joke: “If Alan’s lucky he might get the £ that’s left over!” Also winning big was Kath’s next-door neighbour of  years, -year-old Wayne Smith. Wayne was in disbelief when he was contacted by the lottery, but once he realised it was the real deal, he said he was ‘shaking like a leaf and crying’ at the prospect of winning. He was joined by his we of  years, Tracey, when he discovered his prize amount and was speechless for a few moments before he said: “That’s brill. It’s a once in a letime thing!” Tracey, who has lived on the winning street all her le, was teary eyed when she saw the sum. She said: “Oh my God, wow. It doesn’t seem real. It seems like a dream. I’m going to have to pinch myself to wake myself up. “You don’t think people like us will win it – we’re not posh, we’re down to earth! “It’s a dream, it’s everything.” With three children and four grandchildren, Tracey says the whole family has won: “We’re all going to benefit from this. We’ll look after them all.” The pair also have a few plans to treat themselves too. Tracey, who was made redundant last year but now works as a production operative at a pudding factory, commented: “We can get the house done up properly now, which we’ve never been able to do. “It’s my th birthday next year too, I’ll be flying out to Gran Canaria now!” Asked how they’d be celebrating, Wayne replied: “Babysitting! But we’ll get a takeaway and have a bottle too.” Wayne and Tracey were delighted to have won alongside next-door neighbours Kath and Alan.  Tracey said: “Kath would be sewing for hours and hours, you could hear her machine going and then there were scrubs hanging all along the washing line drying. She sewed a little tag with a ‘love you’ inside every set of scrubs too. “When Kath won the award, she said she didn’t think she deserved it because she just did her little bit. You couldn’t ask for better neighbours.” Another big winner on the street was -year-old Chris Neale who also took home £,. After catching a glimpse of his prize cheque, he said: “Wow! Thank you very much. Iaposm sure the kids will help me spend that.” Chris, who works as a wood machinist for a furniture company has always had a dream car in mind. He said: “I’ll probably buy an old car, Mk  Ford EscortI can get a hold of one. I’ve always wanted one, I’ve even got a little picture of it in my shed. “Youaposve made my dreams come true.” Prize amounts for the other players in the winning sector ranged from £, to £, depending on the number of tickets played with. People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson said: “It was an absolute pleasure to deliver some good news to Kath, Wayne, Chris and their families today. “I’ve loved hearing their plans for their winnings and I’m sure there will be lots of celebrations going on in NG  this bank holiday weekend!” People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day.

The other driver Carl Kidd who was taking his heavily pregnant partner to see his parents told the hearing: aposaposShe was well over on my side of the road and she was coming at speed. I steered away to avoid a head on collision but she caught the back end of my car. aposaposI made sure my partner was okay then went over to confronted her the other driver. She then opened the door and there were three kids in the back and a young girl in the passenger seat, all children. aposaposShe got out and abruptly walked over to my car. I said: aposlook what you have done apos and asked for her insurance details but she offered me £, to not go through the insurance. aposaposI said there wasn’t a chance of that because the chassis was bent over where she had hit me and we went over it back and forth. I asked her again for her insurance details and eventually she gave them, got into her car and sped off. I then rang the police and got nothing  other than her name, insurance company and I had taken a picture of her registration. “She appeared to be intoxicated and was slurring her words and was unsteady on her feet. I think she was trying to overpower me. I did not smell any alcohol but she was slurring her words. I have been around drunk people in my le and she did not appear to be sober. She appeared drunk to me and my partner agreed she didn’t seem right.aposapos aposThe court heard police arrived at Ridingsapos home at .pm where she was said to have an aposaposelevating demeanour.aposapos After blowing almost four times the limit she took a second test which showed she had mg in breath. Ridings told the hearing: aposaposI was coming round a bend and was going down the hill but as I accelerated the car skidded and I have clipped the other car. I did say: aposcan we not go with insuranceapos as I had £, in savings which I could use. I said my premiums were really high as it is due to my vehicle being a sports car and because of my age. But he said it would be more than that and something needed to happen that day. I felt uncomfortable. It was only minor damage - just a scrape. There was more damage to my car. I had not had any alcohol by that stage. “I drove off because other cars were beeping and he was aggressive and the kids were screaming. We were not getting anywhere. I went to Paige’s house and there I was trying to calm down and I asked her to get me a drink. aposaposI was wanting to get picked up, I was shook up and had had a drink. I had two big drinks before I left her house and I got a lt home. He had been aggressive with me when he didn’t really have a right to. aposaposI got into the car and drove off to Paige’s. Everything was happening too fast and the kids were hysterical. At Paige’s I was panicking and asked her to get me a strong drink. I just needed to calm my nerves and I stood outside her house having a glass a of vodka which more or less neat and I then necked it then had another one whilst I was getting the kids out of my car and into my friends van.aposapos Breaking down in tears she added: “I just feel like a bad mum drinking. I was there - minutes and it was long enough to have two drinks. I just panicked. They were incredibly strong drinks. I had not had a drink before it.aposapos Miss Azad, a care assistant told JPs: aposaposWhen I saw her she was distraught and crying her eyes out - but was not under the influence of alcohol, no way. She said: aposcan you make me a drinkapos and I saw a litre of vodka. Itaposs all my fault as I might as well have given her the whole litre of vodka. I am not going to lie. She just necked it. aposaposI just wanted to calm her nerves and to calm her down whilst she was arranging a lt on her phone. I saw the vodka used a tall pint glass and put in a lot of vodka. aposaposI got her another drink and she necked that one too. I would never let her drink drive home. Prosecutor Nick Smart told the hearing: “Mr Kidd gave a breathtakingly honest account about the incident. He was always going to be angry and upset. This lady was said to be distraught whilst her animated friend gave her a drink. It does not pan out. “The situation was fraught with emotion, one party had children in the car the other party had a heavily pregnant woman. It is very easy to say I would not drive because it would put my children’s safety at risk but a lot of people do drink and drive. It is quite common regrettably. People who have had a drink make ill-founded decisions and that is what has happened in this case.” But defence lawyer Dave Holland said: aposaposThe two of them had a conversation lasting - minutes and whilst Mr Kidd had some suspicions she was drunk, he could not be sure and he could not smell alcohol. He accepted he became aggressive and she felt threatened. She has never been in trouble before.aposapos In clearing Ridings, the chairman of the bench who would only give her name as Mrs Furness said: aposaposMr Kidd was clear and credible. Miss Ridings was often confused, emotional at times and misleading. The other lady, Paige was totally incredible. aposaposHowever, the prosecution have not proved beyond reasonable doubt this case. There is insufficient evidence to prove you were over the limit at the time of the incident or at the time of consuming. We therefore find you not guilty.” As Ridings and Miss Azad celebrated outside, prosecutors questioned the verdict but Mrs Furness insisted: aposWe believe the Crown’s case has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.

And a nearly empty fresh fruit and veg section was also seen in an Asda store in Cardf, where some of the freezer and fridge sections were completely empty. The news comes as millions of Brits have been unable to buy essential food in the past fortnight, with one in three already having started stockpiling for Christmas.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror This has led to calls for Britainaposs supermarkets to ditch their traditional rivalries in a bid to boost the beleaguered supply chain this Christmas and prevent almost one in three lorries on the road being completely empty. Rival retail chains have been told that they need to collaborate in the run-up to the festive season as the shortage of haulage drivers continues to threaten stock deliveries across the country. Trade magazine The Grocer reported that supermarkets have been urged to avoid a survival of the fittest Christmas this year to prevent further stresses piling onto an already creaking logistics network. The call comes as statistics from the Department for Transport show that poor utilisation of distribution capacity sees around  per cent of lorries on the road completely empty while those that contain goods are on average only  per cent full.  The Grocer said that the UKaposs ongoing driver shortage has created stf competition among supermarkets for limited haulage availability, with each retailer intent on minimising their own disruption. But as demand builds in the run-up to Christmas they have been urged to show greater collaboration to ease the burden on supply chains. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, told the magazine: The biggest choice every one of the major supermarkets has got this week is: are we going to have a survival of the fittest Christmas or are we going to all work together and try and get through Christmas. The problem with crisis is everyone fights to protect their own. So what you are finding is businesses fighting to protect the certainty of their own deliveries and that pushes against collaboration and co-ordination of efficiencies.  Tesco said this week that it was increasing its use of rail freight by almost per cent to help keep its shelves stocked during the driver crisis. It has also been reported that bus drivers are quitting to take up better-paid work as lorry drivers, leaving some key routes understaffed or axed entirely from the timetable, as operators point the finger at road haulage bosses for poaching their drivers in recent months. Britainaposs supply chains were brought to a standstill by the exodus of European truckers, leading to fuel shortages and empty shelves in supermarkets, as a result of the Boris Johnsonaposs governmentaposs disastrous Brexit plan.  Ministers stepped up their drive to avoid further lorry driver shortages by moving to create an additional , fast-track driver courses and almost a million letters have gone out asking HGV licence-holders who have left the industry, including bus drivers, to .At the same time, Boris Johnson has jetted off for a sunshine break in Spain, travelling to Marbella with his we Carrie and their young son Wilf on Friday after attending the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester. But Brits back home are feeling the winter chill as millions face soaring UK energy bills, food and fuel shortages, and the impact of the cut to Universal Credit.

The court heard the man fell in love with CaplanLouise Caplan arriving at Aylesbury Crown Court Image: Vagner Vidal Hyde News  Pictures LtdByJames Llewelyn:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA -year-old escort conned her sugar daddy out of £. million after he fell in love with her, a court heard. Henry Sless, a retired Deloitteaposs executive, found escort girl Louise Caplan online and they started dating, despite their -year age gap. The court heard Caplan asked the millionaire to be her sugar daddy in exchange for £,-a-year, but Mr Sless managed to negotiate the fee down to £, a month. Both Caplan and Mr Sless lived in upmarket Buckinghamshire, the woman in the village of Chalfont St. Giles and Mr Sless in the town of Marlow, the court heard. Prosecutors told the judge that Caplan bought herself a £ million house with Mr Slessapos money which she obtained by lying that she was investing in businesses in Dubai and Dublin. She also bought artwork worth £,. Mr Sless, who was  years old at the time, showered Caplan with gts worth more than £ million. He also parted with another £. million which he wrongly believed the wannabe businesswoman was investing, Aylesbury Crown Court heard. Jon Swaine, defence counsel for Caplan, said: It was a sad situation of two people who had fantasies. Each had their own fantasy. Hers was that she wanted to be a successful businesswoman and his came at a time when he was unhappy in his personal le. He made decisions that were disastrous and astonishing for a man with his expertise and background. The decisions he made were not made using his head, that is for sure. Judge Francis Sheridan heard the couple met via the online escort website Adult Works in November  after Mr Sless agreed to pay her £ for sex. Prosecutor Stefan Weidmann said: Mr Sless said in a statement aposit felt like we clicked immediately and within a few days of our first meeting Ms Caplan sent a message saying she would have married meI would have been  years younger and she was  years older. We met five or so times in the first year and we were in contact on a daily basis. I instantly fell for her. As the relationship developed, Caplan began to demand money from Mr Sless, the court heard. In a statement, Mr Sless said: Sometime in late November or early December , Ms Caplan came to me and asked meI would be her apossugar daddyapos. She asked me to give her £, a year, I negotiated it down to £, per month. Judge Francis Sheridan heard how the wealthy tax executive showered Caplan with gts worth £ million over the course of their relationship. It was also revealed that the couple had met on at least six occasions for sex, although the judge suggested it could have been more times. However, the court heard that the escort defrauded him out of at least £. million.  Caplan spent more than £ million on a luxury house in Farnham Common, as well as nearly £, on artwork and £, on luxury retail goods, despite having previously had an annual income of only £,, the court heard. The judge was told that despite the loans Mr Sless was handing out, the veteran accountant did not demand any paperwork. Prosecutor Stefan Weidmann said: When asked why he would give such enormous loans on an informal basis Mr Sless said he the pair to be in a long term relationship and he believed that they had a future together and they would be married and together raise Ms Caplanaposs daughter. However, Judge Sheridan questioned: Of course he would have had paperwork, he was an accountant  What am I missing   Mr Weidmann admitted that Mr Sless was a man of staggering naivety, despite his vast experience. He had believed that the money was going to be spent on property development in Dublin and Dubai, despite having seen only very limited evidence of their existence. Earlier, the hearing had been delayed by nearly three hours after Caplan had to be examined under the mental health act. During the hearing, the escort was often tearful and was visibly emotional at the mention of her daughter. Defending her, Mr Swaine revealed that she had attempted to use the money genuinely to pursue her dream of becoming a successful interior designer, and it was only when the bills began to catch up with her that she turned to fraud. He said: She intended to use this money in a business but she was hopelessly out of her depth. She hired expensive accountants who advised her that she had no hope of success. Her huge error was not to go to Mr Sless and say I have been stupid and I have let you down. She had no hope of paying this all back. Caplan had earlier admitted one count of fraud. She arrived at Aylesbury Crown Court to hear her fate carrying a Louis Vuitton designer bag containing personal possessions to take into prison. Sentencing her to five and a quarter years in prison, Judge Sheridan said: I am in no position to tell the truth of how many times he took advantage of your sexual services. It was at least six times but I am strongly suspicious about that given the extremely large figures in this fraud. This had all the hallmarks of a business arrangement andit was business, it was certainly not done properly. As she was led away, Caplan remained standing in the dock, before she waved to her mother, who sat in the public gallery, and told her to pass on her love to her daughter.

Brendan James, , stumbled upon the cave in Shnal, Shrops., after a friend read about it online. The explorer took his , subscribers on a virtual journey as he filmed himself exploring the cave. Locals have long claimed that the Caynton Caves were used by the Knights Templar in the th century. Historic England described the cave as a grotto and believe it was built in the th century - a few hundred years after the Templar order was disbanded. Brendan said he was left feeling claustrophobic and uneasy while down in the grotto. The entrance is a small hole underneath a tree - easy for anyone to miss. He said: We went into it, and it is a small crawl space which leads to a huge sandstone cave. You wouldnapost think in a million years it would be there. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Brendan admitted he was sceptical at first. Even though the cave has been linked to the medical military group, it is likely to be a Victorian folly. Brendan said: There were some photos online, but nothing of signicance. But when I went down there it opened my eyes. It was expansive. Someone had been down there and put in the effort to make such beautul carvings.  It must have looked pristine when it was first done. The cave is covered with graffiti and Brendan also found a picture of a man in a ritual room. He also discovered a semi-collapsed wall - which sparked concerns over the safety of the structure. He said: I didnapost think I was claustrophobic, but I was thankful to get out. Brendan left the cave after about half an hour of exploring because he said he started to feel a little dazed.

The  film then cuts to another home where a man reaches for a book.I thought of that scene when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp went down for several hours twice last week.Far from panicking at my place, we actually managed to get a few things done. Yes the service outage was a reminder that we rely far too heavily on the information super-highway. But it was also a chance to remember some of the other things out there to enjoy, particularly in a society that speaks to each other less and less. The service outage couldn’t have been better timed, either. It came as US whistleblower Frances Haugen, an ex-Facebook employee, revealed thousands of pages of internal research suggesting that the firm was – and still is – well aware of the harm its content can cause. And yet it does nothing about it. I suspect I was among many parents reminding their children – and themselves – that the whole unseemly episode was a warning. Mainly that we should not leave ourselves at the mercy of a company that, in the opinion of many, places profit over our wellbeing. In addition, the idea that Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg would go on holiday rather than defend himself in person over the allegations seemed ridiculous. As ludicrous as believing civil servants working from home here were responsible for leaving Afghan translators behind to their fate at the hands of the Taliban. It helped, however, to make the point superbly. Zero accountability at a time when we need answers, with our mental health at stake. We use social media for so much, too much, these days. We are a society endlessly running our index finger down a bit of plastic in an interconnected world. Last week was a glimpse at an alternative reality.

Sophie told Stoke on Trent Live: “We wanted a bigger house and a new beginning somewhere.  Do you have a story that you think we should cover  Get in touch with us at webnews@mirror“At the time we were elated we were moving in. When we moved in the property needed decorating.

It’s five-inch deep holes, it’s disgusting.  “The front lawn and everything needs redoing. The brick wall at the front is falling down. “The whole structure of the house needs to be done.” Sophie says she expects compensation and a bigger property for the issues the young family had to deal with.She also wants repairs to be carried, which are estimated to run to £,. Sophie, a housing officer, added: “My children can’t go out in the garden. It’s disgusting. I want to move now. The neighbours are making comments about how horrible the house looks.  “Everyone ’s houses look really nice and then you’ve got this house which is an absolute shambles. The only thing I can use my garden for is putting the washing on a line. “I had the six-week holiday with the kids and I had to stay in the house or take them out because I can’t use the garden. “What I would like out of all of this is a usable house that is a three-bedroom. I want compensation for all the inconveniences because we’ve had to live here from June to now and nothing has been done. “They are telling me they are sending people out to me and they don’t.

Jan Holman, , was admitted to hospital six weeks ago and is now a patient at the Hospice of the Good Shepherd in Chester. Her quick referral to the hospice meant she hadnapost had a chance to say goodbye to her dogs, Monty and Rowley, or Bob, her horse of  years. Due to the pandemic Jan was unable to have any visitors at the hospital, and her husband of  years, Dennis, said she found having no visitors or personal contact dficult. After four weeks, Jan was moved to the hospice to receive end-of-le care. Knowing Jan was also missing her animals, the hospice arranged for a visit from her two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Monty and Rowley, as well as her horse, Bob. Even though she was unable to get out of bed, Jan was excited to have the chance to see the gang one more time. Dennis said: “It was just such a relief once Jan was moved from the hospital to the hospice in Chester and we were able to have named visitors who could come and see Jan regularly, however we never imagined that we would be able to include Monty, Rowley and Bob on the visiting list.”  He continued: “All the staff here have been wonderful. Jan has been so well cared for, nothing is too much trouble even down to the chef coming every day to see what he can tempt Jan to eat. Nothing is too much trouble, including arranging for a horse to visit!” Before her illness Jan, who has lived in Chester all of her le, could be seen dressed as Chesteraposs Tudor Lady delivering tours of the city where she has been a Blue Badge Tour Guide for  years. Jan said: “I just can’t believe what the staff here at the hospice have done for me. Until a few weeks ago I was still riding Bob every day and he is such an important part of my le, and I have missed him so much. I knew that arranging for my dogs to visit was possible as we had a neighbour who was a patient at the hospice a few years ago and we were allowed to bring the dogs to visit her, but I just didn’t expect that they would ever be able to give me the chance to see Bob one more time.”  Louise Saville King, deputy ward manager at the hospice, said: “It was obvious when Jan first came to us that she is passionate about her animals and that horses have played a large part in her le for many years. The ethos of hospice care is not just about caring for the clinical needs of our patients but also looking after their emotional and spiritual needs as well. It’s about making a dference to our patients and their families in whatever way we can. “We know that sometimes people are scared at the thought of coming to the hospice, but it’s a positive place where people are supported and well cared for. The work of the hospice really does make a dference to people’s lives.“Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsHorsesAnimalsFriskTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was actually on my lunch break at work, so I shared the news straight away with all my colleagues!” Sarah is one of  million people who have received that exciting news telling them theyaposre a winner, since The Health Lottery launched  years ago, giving away £ million in prizes in that time. And the timing was perfect for the mother and grandmother from Oldham. Sarah turns  soon, and the £, windfall means she can really celebrate her half-century milestone in style. With partner Darren also reaching that golden birthday this year, Sarah plans to invest her winnings in a top-notch sunny holiday.The Health Lottery turns  this month. In that time,  million players have netted £ million worth of prizes - and theyaposre not the only winners. The Health Lottery is committed to supporting communities that need it most, and so far £ million has been raised for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health. There are five main draws every weekeach with a jackpot of £,.

My partner and I both turn the big - this year, and we’re treating ourselves with a holiday of a letime to Mexico. We will certainly be enjoying a margarita or two on The Health Lottery.” And itaposs not just the winners that benefit, as money raised through The Health Lottery helps fund vital local community projects. £ million has been raised so far, for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health.This is one of the reasons Sarah plays The Health Lottery online. “I have been playing The Health Lottery once a week since , picking two lines,” she explains.My nan had Alzheimer’s, so it is really important for me to support these projects. They are empowering the most vulnerable communities and tackling health inequalities around Great Britain. It is fantastic that I can give back a little to these wonderful projects by simply buying a ticket.” I asked my we to check all the numbers! For Nuneaton Rugby Club player, Allan Taylor, finding out heaposd scooped £, in last yearaposs New Year’s Day draw was a great way to kick of .  “You never think it is going to be you,” said father-of-three Allan, . “I couldn’t believe it was true! I asked my we and girls to all check my numbers. We wanted to make sure it was the real deal before we could properly celebrate! They were ecstatic about the news. It has allowed us to get that long weekend in Dublin that we have always wanted. I really fancy going on the Guinness factory tour and learning a little more about my favourite stout.” One of the reasons Allan plays is because it allows him to give something back. Playing The Health Lottery supports so many great causes. We are a family that has received some great support over the years from local causes. It is wonderful that we can give back to these grassroots projects simply by buying a Health Lottery ticket.” The size of the prize hasnapost sunk in yet! When Sue from Chesterfield got a phone call from The Health Lottery asking her to check her online Health Lottery account - something Sue hadn’t done in a while - what she saw changed her le. She had won £, in a second chance draw. “To be honest, I’ve been thinking about what I need,” said Sue, when asked what sheaposll spend the money on. I barely spend money on myself normally so this is a chance to fix up some things that need done. The garden. The house. Things like that. The size of the prize hasn’t sunk in yet so who knows what will be left. Maybe enough for a car  A holiday  It’s exciting to think about.” The former community worker says that playing The Health Lottery is a continuation of her work to support others. She said: “I’ve always been keen on helping people. I’ve been brought up that way. So I’d happily spend £ on a Health Lottery ticket because I know that it genuinely helps people. I’ve seen some of the good causes that are supported. Obviously I play the lottery for the prizes, as we all do, but the sense of supporting your community really sweetens the win.” It’s been a great moment to share In August , the News UK finance team syndicate scooped a fantastic £, after matching  balls, plus the bonus ball. Formed of eight players, the Peterborough-based team have been playing The Health Lottery for three years now – and were delighted to bag their first big win.  Syndicate leader Gary Smithdale said: “When I answered the call, the news came as a great surprise – I couldn’t wait to tell everyone! Some of us have worked together for over  years, so it’s been a great moment to share.” Their big win even inspired a new team name. “What about Sunshine  ” mused team member Margaret Lenton. “The sun’s shining on this lucky day, and there’s eight of us!”It is very important to support the local charities that benefit from Health Lottery salesKathy Brown, a Buckinghamshire Council Business Support Officer from Aylesbury, was delighted when she found out she had won £, in The Health Lottery’s draw online. Amazingly, this is the second time she has won a tidy sum by playing The Health Lottery, although her recent winnings dwarf the £ won previously. Big hearted Kathy says a big reason she plays is to support local causes and community projects: “In this day and age I think it is very important to support The Health Lottery and all the charities that are supported.”  While she plans on enjoying spending much of her winnings herself, she said she will make sure her daughters benefit too, selflessly spreading the joy to her family.

Charlie Naughton, , was in a pub with family and friends when he jumped up to celebrate the strike on June  before suddenly falling down and hitting his head.The devoted Cha fan, described by a coroner as fit and well, died around an hour later at the hospital. A pathologist was unable to find a cause of death and a coroner recorded an open conclusion. A post-mortem found Charlie was only just over the drink-drive limit and there was no evidence he had taken drugs, West London Coroneraposs Court heard.  In a statement, the family paid tribute to the happy-go-lucky and loyal bricklayer who adored his family and Cha FC. His mum Karen Sayer said: Cha was his true love. He travelled land and sea to support and watch them. He took regular bike rides and would walk his beloved dog Mush. He was a hard-working man - working every day on ious sites and doing private work as he was a fully qualied bricklayer. Charlie loved his family dearly. Charlie enjoyed time with his mates, most of whom he had gone to nursery with. He was with his best mates when he passed. He enjoyed many holidays together, sometimes twice a year together as a family. He was the most loyal and respectful person you would meet. He was always concerned about other people, especially his sisters and mum.  She said over , people attended his funeral as Charlie had many friends. She added: Charlieaposs passing has had a massive effect on many many people. Never did we expect to walk out of his front door one morning to never come back. Absolute heartbreak and devastation all in the blink of an eye. He had his whole le and a million dreams in front of him. He was my first ever best friend, my everything. The inquest heard Charlie was at a pub in Uxbridge, west London, watching the game with friends and his dad, and had drunk around six pints of lager. An ambulance was called at .pm and paramedics found he had an irregular heartbeat.  Despite resuscitation attempts, Charlie was pronounced dead around an hour later at Hillingdon Hospital AE. It was said the only injuries found on Charlie were a bruise on his head and a bitten tongue, the inquest heard. The post-mortem did not find any evidence he had a heart attack and there were no findings of heart or lung disease. Pathologist Dr Hiam Ali said Charlie died of sudden adult death. Mrs Sayer told the inquest her son had been wrongfully described as a regular cocaine user in documents sent to the coroner. She said: It states Charlie was a regular cocaine user - thataposs not the case. He was in no way a regular user, that word to me shouldnapost be there. Coroner Lydia Brown said: There was no evidence of recent cocaine use. It wasnapost found in the toxicology. She added: Iaposm afraid when you analyse sudden adult death that it doesnapost explain anything at all. Itaposs used when you canapost find a reason why Charlie is not with us. Recording an open conclusion, the coroner said: Charlie was watching a game of football in a public house on the  June  when he collapsed. There were no signicant injuries sustained. Paramedics resuscitated him at the scene and conveyed him to Hillingdon Hospital by ambulance where continued resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. I will be recording what is known as an open conclusion - it means the evidence does not reach the test Iaposm obliged to use. We have exhausted all lines of enquiry. It doesnapost really provide the family with any further explanation. Itaposs exceptionally rare where someone dies in these circumstances.The inquest heard Charlie tested positive for coronavirus in January this year and had received both doses of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine however this was not thought to be related to his death.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Harry KaneEuro England football teamFuneralsInquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Prince of Wales talked about his unusual car in a new wide-ranging interview with the BBC, where he chats about the environment and climate change.During the interview, Charles was asked about his own carbon footprint as well as his love of cars. Interviewer Justin Rowlatt said: Is it fair to say you are a bit of a Clarkson, a bit of a kind of petrol head, and youaposve always enjoyed cars  Charles replied: Yes, but that was before we knew what the problems were.  But my old Aston Martin, which Iaposve had for  years Iaposve managed to covert. I hardly have a chance to drive it now but that now runs on waste products, can you believe this, surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process. As well as converting his car, Charles also revealed some of the steps he has taken to reduce his carbon footprint. These included cutting out meat and fish from his diet two days a week and cutting dairy one day a week, installing solar  on Clarence House and at Highgrove and using biomass boilers that use wood chippings to heat his Birkhall estate.

Meanwhile, he also revealed the sweet tribute he has created in honour of his grandson Prince George on the Balmoral estate. During the interview, Charles is seen wandering around a garden he planted at Birkhall that he has called Prince Georgeaposs Wood. Explaining the signicance of the garden, Charles said: This was a rather empty field that the farm didnapost need anymore. The great thing was, I managed to plant it the same year that my grandson was born, the eldest, George. So, I thought Iaposd call it Prince Georgeaposs Wood. I just hope he appreciates it one day.The interview comes after it was revealed that Charles will attend the COP climate change summit in Glasgow next month.Other senior royals who will also attend are the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.The Big Interviews: Prince Charles and His Battle For Our Planet is available on BBC iPlayer.Comment MORE ON Prince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyClimate change\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Whether it be in supermarkets, for the tube or just to get a coffee, we all instinctually follow the leader and plonk ourselves behind the person at the back to politely wait our turn.Recently drivers queued for hours to for fuel as a delivery crisis gripped the nation. But how much better would it beyou could just get someone  to do it for you  Fear not, the website TaskRabbit offers the option to employ people to queue for you, for just the low low price of £. an hour.  It lists a number of roles that their ‘elite taskers’ can participate in with a collection of pro-queuers having their profile promoted on the site. The rates for these queuers y from the low ball figure of £. an hour to an eye watering £.. With the very specic pricing, it can be assumed that part of the reason for the seemingly extortionate rates is a commission taken by the site itself. Greg S, who is charging the premium price for his services, said: “I’ve queued for theatre tickets and shop launches from very unsociable hours!” With the increasing number of product drops by popular fashion brands, which limit the amount of time and quantity that items are sold in, and long lines to get the latest iPhone on day of release, paying someone to queue may only grow in scope, especially with the reintroduction of in-person shopping. One person listed on the website has been hired  times to queue at £. an hour. Most people that list queuing as something they can be hired for are not solely available as queuers, offering all sorts of services from pet sitting to baking. As the gig economy expands and some Londoners willing to pay for convenience, this might be a trend that continues to grow - and at £ an hour who wouldn’t be motivated to participate in Britain’s supposed favourite pastime.

Meghan said there had been “several conversations” within the Royal Family about how dark their baby’s skin might be, ahead of Archie Mountbatten-Windsoraposs birth.

Barnes, a father-of-seven who is married to a white woman, said most black people would expect that conversation to happen.In an interview about his new book, The Uncomfortable Truth About Racism, he told The Times : “If you listen to what Meghan says, it’s not about them worryingthe baby is dark or not, it’s them worrying about how the public are going to view that. “Because they knowthe baby is too dark, the public will not view the baby as positively. They’re being realistic. “Let’s not pretend the public wonapost care whether itaposs a blond-haired blue-eyed baby or jet black, because they will.” Barnes went on to say he wasnapost a big fan of Meghan and Harry, before suggesting that opinion could unfairly lead to people being called racist.  He also said his family loved Prince William and Kate Middleton as well as Princess Diana, who he likened to a goddess. In recent years Barnes has split opinion when it comes to his interventions on the topic of race. During his heyday as one of the most gted England footballers of his generation, a photo of him backheeling a banana off the pitch during a Merseyside derby became an iconic anti-racism image.  In recent years he has supported Liam Neeson for opening up about his desires to hurt a black man after someone close to him was raped. Barnes praised the actor for being open and honest about his unconscious bias. He would later speak in defence of Peter Beardsley, who made racist comments to young black players as Newcastle’s under‑ coach.“I’m not an apologist,” Barnes told thetwo years ago.“I give balanced, constructive views and what happens is that bits and pieces of what I say are used against me. For a long time John Barnes was seen as the voice of reason when it came to race.

The angry reaction began with one parent on a visit to Sainsburyaposs coming across the problematic clothing and made a post titled nothing is going to change for women while girls are still targeted by this b******t. They said: In Sainsburyaposs this morning. In the boysapos clothes aisle, I noticed tops with the words UNLIMITED and UNSTOPPABLE printed on them. Took a quick detour down the girlaposs aisle to see what similarly empowering messages were being directed at them... aposLetaposs Stay Homeapos. Because the world belongs to men, who face no limits to where they go and what they can do. Theyaposre unstoppable. But hey, smile and be happy with your small domestic existence, girls. Along with this post, they shared pictures of the offending clothes, showing a big dference between the messaging being sent to boys and girls. The reaction online was one of exasperation and frustration from mums all too used to the problem. Ugh. Itaposs not even insidious, pretty obvious and evident, one groaned. I agree the messaging is really terrible, as are the clothes themselves but anyway. Conditioning does start from pretty much the womb.  The original poster also added a follow-up post saying: I honestly canapost believe that no one in the meeting where this seasonaposs collection was signed off flagged up that this might need looking at again. Who designs these things  Who approves them  Iaposd actually really like to know. My kids are in their late teens and twenties now and Iaposm shocked by how much more polarised the messaging has become since I was buying this stuff. There was always a bit of a kittens and sharks ide, but not such extreme dferences in messages. It feels like grooming. Another shopper shared their recent experience in another big store. Iaposve just been in Primark this morning and all hoodies in my daughteraposs size were aposbe niceapos aposalways be kindapos etc which are such f*****g dangerous messages to send little girls, they said. In my sonaposs size he had dinosaurs, aposIaposm roarsomeapos aposT-Rex expertapos. Iaposm so tired of it. Another questioned: Why is the onus on girls to be compliant, forgiving, and agreeable  Some parents made the point that the responsibility for messages like these doesnapost just lie with the producers but also the consumer. Change only happenseverybody takes responsibility. This includes big businesses, retailers, manufacturers as well as parents, and schools, a parent said. Everyone has a stake in making a better future free of damaging stereotypes. The letaposs stay home t-shirt is filtered using the girls section on Sainsburyaposs website, and the unlimited hoody by the boys section. All kids clothing on the website feature a kids tags rather than gendered ones.

Jeanette Carden spent more than eight hours waiting outside Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital in the back of an ambulance before she was admitted. But once there she faced a catalogue of issues, including being the lone female patient in a ward with five men - a practice out of favour with the Scottish Government since . The -year-old also contracted E Coli during her stay at the hospital. Jeanette, who suffers from chest condition Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder, told the Express: “It really was horrendous. I would expect better in the third world.” Her ordeal began on September , when she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Jeanette, from Gallowhill, said: “First of all, I spent eight and a half hours in an ambulance outside. The paramedics were brilliant but they had to wait with me. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter “They were supposed to finish at pm but ended up staying there until they could be relieved at pm. “A nurse came out to give me a covid test, which came back clear, to seeI could be taken in through AE but they refused. I eventually went into SATA”.The Specialist Assessment and Treatment Area- where patients experiencing respiratory dficulties receive specialist triage - ispart of the NHS board’s contingency planning for emergency departments in response to the coronavirus pandemic.She was kept in hospital for several days before being moved to ward , where she was dismayed to find all the other patients were male. Jeanette said: “On the Thursday we were told we had been exposed to covid in the room. “Some patients were tested and sent home. “By the time Friday came there were three of us, one of the men had pneumonia, and we were getting sent to other wards and that ward was getting shut down. “I thought I was getting sent home but I was shted, they tested me for covid and it came back clear. “They shted me up to ward , where they put me on a ward with five men. I told the nurse: ‘I’m not very happy with this, I’m supposed to share a toilet with five men ’  “She said: ‘I can get you a commode and we can pull the curtain round.’ I didn’t want to sit on the ward and use a commode with five men around. It’s about having a bit of respect for me and for them.” Jeanette also told how a patient she had been in the previous ward with, passed away on ward , adding: “They brought his family in, who were grieving. He passed away around am and they didn’t take him away until am. It was really upsetting.“I was lying in bed listening to the family grieving. I thought ‘that’s not right’, surely he should have been taken to a privateroom.”But worse was to come when an elderly male patient was also admitted to the ward on Monday September . Jeanette said: “I don’t know whether it was dementia the man had but he was wandering about, he went into the toilet and came out covered in poo, the toilet was a mess as well. I pressed the buzzer to tell the nurses and askedhe could be shted, they said they couldn’t because the ward was on lockdown. “They had to come in and clean him up and clean up the toilet. “On the Tuesday he must have been up through the night, when the nurse came to open the curtains in the morning, he had peed in the night on the floor round my bed. “I discovered he had peed on my housecoat and my things as well. I had a wee cardboard bowl because I was feeling sick and he had peed on that.”She added: “He was wandering about all the time at night and from that point on I hardly slept. I thought: ‘This is not right, I’m in heresupposed to be trying to get well. It wasn’t the man’s fault, he shouldn’t have been there in the first place.”Jeanette says hard-pushed staff hardly entered the ward except at mealtimes and says it added to a string of issues, including commodes not being emptied for hours and delays in changing a blood-spattered pillowcase from a cut to her elbow, which was left from Friday to Monday. She also alleges clinicians told her she “had a bug” during her stay but only when she read her discharge notes at home did she realise she had contracted troublesome stomach bacteria E Coli. Jeanette, who was finally discharged last week, said she had been left “dreading the next time” she has to be admitted to hospital. A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde extended the board’s apologies over Jeanette’s ordeal, saying: “We are sorry to hear about this patient’s experience and we would ask her to get in touch so we can listen and discuss, first hand, her treatment.“The RAH, alongside all of our acute sites, is facing signicant challenges with more patients than usual being admitted into ouremergency departments. Unfortunately, this means patients can be waiting for longer periods of time before they can be fully admitted and transferred to the appropriate ward.“We have recruited more than  new nurses across NHSGGC and are recruiting a further  Healthcare Support Workers in the run up to winter. “We’re also working closely with the Scottish Ambulance Service to manage patient flow.”He added: “We strive to ensure all our patients are treated in a clean, comfortable environment, and our aim is always to deliver safe,effective person centred care to all iniduals. We can confirm we are reviewing the situation and will take on any lessons learned. “If there is a suspected case or cases of Covid- on wards, we follow standard infection prevention and control protocols in order tominimise the spread of the virus. This means that wards are temporarily closed to new admissions and to all but essential visitors.“We appreciate this can be dficult for those patients already on the wards and we try to make it as easy as possible for them to maintain contact with loved ones through our virtual visiting iPads, which are on every ward.” Comment MORE ON NHSScottish GovernmentHospitalse.ColiCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Erica Hampton, , has human faeces washing up into her garden, which she says smells like a third world country. Her family claim they have been unable to open their windows for months due to the stench which is caused by next doors toilet flushing into their garden. Despite many attempts to fix the problem which begun in July, water firm Severn Trent have been unable to resolve the leak, Mrs Hampton said. She says the situation has wreaked havoc on her le, along with her husband and -year-old son.  She said: “The smell is asyou are in a third world country. When next door flush their toilet it comes into my garden. You are smelling fresh faeces. “Me and my husband are disabled and I’ve got my -year-old son and my dogs – my little Jack Russell got in the water one time and I had to bathe her and take her to the vets to checkshe was okay. “We have wasted so much money on the back garden. We did it up with gravel and everything. We’ve had to take all that off because it’s soaked in wastewater, it stinks. We’ve lost a lot of money through it.” She added: “It’s so depressing. We can’t open the windows or the doors because of the smell. We can’t let the dogs out the back.  When I’m not feeling my best I have to take the dogs for a longer walk because they can’t go outside and have a run, it’s putting pressure on me. “I have to ask my son or my mum to help me walk the dogs. It’s disgusting and they are treating me like I’m thick, I’m not thick. I want them to fix it and compensate me for the garden. All the soil and grass has got to be taken out because of the smell. I spent a couple of hundred pounds on it. I am disappointed with Severn Trent.” Mrs Hampton says she is waiting for Severn Trent to contact her about what will happen next. A Severn Trent spokesman said: “We’re sorry to hear about the issues Ms Hampton has been experiencing. “We are currently investigating the cause of the problems, with teams most recently visiting the site last Friday. However due to access restrictions they will be re-attending at the earliest opportunity to use a CCTV camera to fully inspect the pipe to understand the cause of the issues. “If investigations show the problem is due to an issue on our network, it will be our priority to ensure the issue is fixed, and everything is back to normal as soon as possible.” Comment MORE ON property newsHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Symptoms have been described as being similar to Covid, so how can you tell one from the other Hundreds of thousands of people have been wiped out by a cold that is reportedly worse than Covid at times Image: Getty Images Tetra images RFByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporter:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsMany Brits have been struck down by what has been branded as the worst cold ever - but what are the symptoms and how do you know itaposs not Covid  There isnapost exact data on the number of people who have caught the devastating bug in the past few weeks, as most people donapost report to their GP with a cold.But there is sufficient anecdotal evidence proving the lurgy has spread widely up and down the country.Rather than the usual runny nose and cough, the disease appears to be laying people out. Some people told the Mirror how the cold had been more debilitating than Covid, while others reported having to call sick for weeks because of it. One reported being so badly hit by the bug they had to call sick on the first day of their new job.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments below The spread of whataposs been branded the UKaposs worst lurgy has been attributed to a dip in immunity after a year and a half of social distancing and wearing face masks.Symptoms are very similar to the signs of Covid in a person who has been double-jabbed, raising fears the virus could be dismissed as a cold. So where does this super cold come from and how can you tell itaposs not Covid  Key dferences between cold and Covid symptomsAccording to Professor Azeem Majeed, we are seeing an increase in colds and other respiratory infections across the UK compared to the previous winter, when rates were very low because of social distancing and other infection control measures to tackle Covid.He said the symptoms of a cold typically include a blocked or runny nose, sore throat, headache, cough and sneezing, many of which can also occur in people with Covid-.Now that most adults in the UK have been fully vaccinated, when people do contract Covid-, it is often with milder symptoms that can overlap those from a cold, he told the Mirror. This means that for many people with these kinds of symptoms, a Covid- test will be needed to separate the two conditions. There will be a lot of scope for the public to confuse the symptoms of colds and Covid- during the winter. The message for the public should be to always be cautiousthey have symptoms of a cold, get a test when appropriate, and limit interactions with people outside your household until you are better. NHS guidance says you should treat a cold with:rest and sleep keep warm drink plenty of waterto avoid dehydration gargle salt water to soothe a sore throat You should see a GP :your symptoms do not improve after  weeks your symptoms get suddenly worse your temperature is very high or you feel hot and shivery youaposre concerned about your childaposs symptoms youaposre feeling short of breath or develop chest pain you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes, or a heart, lung or kidney condition you have a weakened immune system – for example, because youaposre having chemotherapy You can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands regularly with warm water and soap, not sharing towels or other household items with someone who has a cold, staying fit and healthy, and avoiding touching your face. The NHS lists the following symptoms as the three big signs of Covid - a high temperature which leaves your back or chest feeling hot, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid study app, the guidance is not up-to-date. The UK still has more cases than most of Europe and I believe this is for two main reasons the first is a lack of masks and social distancing and the second is because we’re ignorant of the symptoms, he told The Mirror. We should be looking out for things like sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. The classic three - cough, fever and anosmia are rarer these days, yet the government has done nothing. By not updating advice, we’re letting people into care homes, schools, workplaces and large gatherings displaying known signs of Covid. Roughly,  in  people in the UK have Covid. If we don’t wake up to the fact these cold-like symptoms could be Covid, we will continue to keep numbers high, putting unnecessary strain on an exhausted NHS. Where does the UKaposs worst cold come from  The spike in viral infections come as the public s to normality -with less stress now on mask wearing and social distancing as Brits head back to work or school.New arrivals at universities also face a spike in Fresheraposs Flu - an increase in viral symptoms as students bring viruses from their own towns to their lecture halls, Wales Online reports.Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth told the BBC she caught a cold at a festival and it was aposthe worst everapos. She said: I barely slept, Iaposd wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired. The cold lasted more than a week, she said. Noor Hashmi, , another student, told the BBC: Normally Iaposm still able to go about my day, but this one left me with muscle fatigue, a lost voice and headache that meant Iaposve just stayed indoors. Dr Philippa advises people experiencing symptoms of Covid - like a new cough, fever, loss of sense of taste or smell - to take a PCR test.Cold symptoms can be treated with rest, fluids and over-the-counter painkillers, she adds. Following Covid prevention measures - like wearing masks and social distancing - means weaposve missed the chance to develop immunity to coughs, cold and flu viruses for two years. As your body has not had the opportunity to fight the illnesses, when they reach you the symptoms can be worse. Should you get a PCR test  The NHS advises people to testthey have any of the Covid symptoms it lists. Experts from Zoe Covid App recommend getting a Covid testyou have common symptoms of Covid, with this being particularly importantyou experience a loss of smell or taste. This is echoed by Cardf Universityaposs Professor Ron Eccles, who told the Mirror you cannot separate colds from Covid in jabbed people.

Sean Rogers Jraposs daughter missed school on Friday, when her bus failed to show up, amid a state-wide issue in Ohio, in the USA. He decided to use his familyaposs limousine, and offered the service to children across Colombus. On the first day he took  young people from home to class and back and by the second day that had reached  pupils. The dad said he needed parents’ permission to take them to school but wanted to take action, rather than have the children left at home or out on the streets. Dozens of parents, mostly from his Linden neighbourhood responded, local news ABC reported.

Not being able to make it to school has been heartbreaking for many students who look forward to class after missing so much last year during the pandemic. “A little girl almost made me cry yesterday, Mr Rogers added.  She cried because she missed, I think they said she missed almost a week of school just due to transportation, and she cried because she was so happy to go to school.

Dr Anna Popova warned of the threat posed by the Black Death, claiming itswas a “risk” to public health because of global warming. “We do see that the borders of plague hotspots have been changing with global warming and climate change, and other anthropogenic effects on the environment.,” she said. “We are aware that cases of plague in the world have been growing. “This is one of the risks on todayaposs agenda.” A rapid response to outbreaks in fleas was essential to stop the spread to humans, said Dr Popova.  Up to  million people were killed by the plague - also known as the Black Death - in the th century, wiping out % of the population of Europe at the time. Russia and China have seen outbreaks in recent years, and so has the US. The United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF warned in August about its resurgence in Africa.  A month earlier the discovery of bubonic plague led to the the cancellation of the Mongolian leg of the Silk Way Rally. The country has suffered a number of outbreaks in recent years. Russia last year took major steps to stop a spread of the Black Death across its frontiers with Mongolia and China. Tens of thousands of people were vaccinated in border areas in the Tuva and Altai republics of Siberia as the country simultaneously fought Covid-.  One outbreak was recorded on the Ukok plateau of the Altai Mountains in Russia - for the first time in more than  years. Bubonic plague is a bacterial d isease spread by fleas living on wild rodents and can kill an adult in less than  hoursnot treated in time.

Deaf and blind dogs experience the world dferently to other pets, but that doesn’t stop them from having fun - as two disabled dogs have proven.The TikTok account @ Echobadlistener documents what it’s like to live with four disabled dogs, each with their own inidual quirks and personalities.But the dogs, named Morty, Echo, Lucy and Frank, still love to try and play with each other, even though they can’t see or hear each other. In an adorable video viewed over , times, their owner showed their fans how some of the dogs try to communicate despite their dferences. The clip sees deaf and blind Morty encouraged to chase Lucy, who is deaf and visually impaired.  Lucy, who has some vision, boops Morty’s nose in a bid to get him to join in, as a confuse Morty tries to work out what the game actually is. The overlaying text read: “Come on, chase me!” as Lucy jumps into a play bow, with Morty edging forward to find her. It looks as though Morty thinks, plotting how to best enter the game, before pouncing forward onto an unsuspecting Lucy. The heart warming video earned hundreds of comments from viewers who adored seeing the duo play.It’s Dog Show week over at TeamDogs - a six-day celebration of what makes our pets special in the style of a virtual village fete without the muddy field and dodgy hotdogs. Every day we will reveal a dferent category that we’d love you to enter by simply sharing a photo or video of your gorgeous dog. Find out how to enter. One said: “Thank you for showing that they do play even though they are deaf and blind.” Another added: “I’m glad to see it’s not just my blind dog who’s still crazy.” Others were impressed with Morty’s skills, convinced he had a plan the whole time. “Morty knew all along, just patiently waiting and plotting,” a third added. Another said: “Morty being sneaky like this makes me smile every time.” Blind dogs can still live a full and happy le, even though they don’t always know what’s going on around them. A one-eyed deaf pitbull Wink also captured the hearts of TikTok viewers last month when he was caught cuddling his ‘emotional support chihuahua. The lovely video shows just how close the two dogs are, with Wink wrapping her legs around the lbs Nfler in a warm embrace while the cosy chihuahua rests its eyes. Other blind dogs simply don’t realise they might run into things, so owners have to adapt their surroundings to avoid injury.Fetch. Chase. Eat. Sleep.

The rescue helicopter was requested to transport the gear required to lower the three people down from the ridge.The team were placed near to the two men and one woman and only by the illumination of one of their head torches were the team able to locate them.However, due to strong winds, the helicopter was unable to help once the team was on the scene and so the team had to lower each person down to the bottom of the gully.This is the fourth call-out over the weekend for Braemar Mountain Rescue Team and Aberdeen Mountain Rescue Team after spending two days attempting to locate a lost hiker.Some of the recent incidents are being linked to the change in weather and darkness setting in a lot sooner as factors in people needing to be rescued.Malcolm MacIntyre, support manager for Braemar Mountain Rescue Team, said: #It#s something that always catches people out this time of year. The days get shorter quite quickly especially when the weather is bad.#It#s common for people to set off later than they intended and end up out at night and for many people that is an alien experience for them. In the darkness, you lose all the landscape features you would normally navigate from.The case of the three rock climbers is unusual due to the fixed routes that climbers generally use and don#t stray away from. They tend to go up and come back down whereas walkers can wander off course and end up lost and disorientated.#Several of the mountain rescue teams have urged people via social media to think carefully and plan for walks during this time of year.Packing items such as a head torch could be vital as it was in this case due to it notying the rescuers of the location of the climbers.After the lowering operation was completed, the team escorted them back safe and well and eventually back to base at .am on October .The onset of darkness also limited the three stranded climbers from abseiling down the side of Eagle Ridge themselves.Mr MacIntyre said: #You tend to rock climb in pitches, which is -metre s, and Eagle Ridge is around six pitches so it is quite a long route.#By the time you get into darkness you can#t always see what is below you and the fear that your rope is not long enough to reach the bottom.#You tend to abseil off the side of Eagle Ridge, down into the adjacent gully which is usually straightforward. However, I understand why they chose not to do that as they might not have been confident when you can#t see what#s below you.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/MicrosoftTeams-image-19-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":"We’ve put together a collection of daily updated charts to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

However, I do know that there were a lot of concerns locally about its effect on existing accommodation providers. Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate. The new proposals will still represent a signicant investment in Tweedbank and the Scottish Borders and will bring jobs to the local area. Irsquom sure everyone will welcome the new investment and will look pragmatically at the new proposals in light of the current economic backdrop.Premier InnA spokesperson told us: ldquoThe contract we agreed with our development partner has now expired and having re-appraised the proposed -bedroom hotel in the current economic climate, it is currently unviable for [owner] Whitbread.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

When they called me for a pre-programme chat, I was asked how my age affected my parenting. I was askedI had less energy as an older parent and got very tired. My response was that every parent, no matter the age, gets very tired!I agreed to do the show. Their intentions were good and I was treated very fairly, and I think the host was sympathetic and supportive. Irsquom not the oldest parent in the land, but I do concede that Irsquom older than most, at least in terms of my younger children, the youngest of whom is six.But the experience raised some interesting questions for me about how age is often used to define us and our abilities, and indeed how we can define ourselves by it.Thankfully, these days society is far more erse and also, I believe, less judgmental, of people who donrsquot conform to stereotyped roles. But the truth is, recently I have begun to feel the cold wind of ageism affecting how I see myself and my opportunities.This radio programme was just the most recent example of my age being regarded an issue. Of course, as we age we do change in our abilities, nobody could deny that. But that can be for the better as well. Being seen as older is relative to the context, I get that. As a dad of young children, I accept the label of older parent. But it was the assumptions about how my age must negatively affect my capabilities as a dad which hit me hard.I felt uncomfortable even acknowledging these feelings to myself. Then I realised that was part of the problem: that people who are older can feel they have no entitlement to speak out against the unfair judgements they feel are attached to their age. Societyrsquos message can be brutal: as people get older, they need to give way and quietly fade .Irsquom nearly , not very old really, but certainly getting on. This is not about denying my age. I would not want to pretend to be younger. I am who I am. Actually, Irsquom quite proud to have made it this far and hope to have a couple more productive decades, at least,my luck holds out.But I fear that so far Irsquove only had a taster of what is to come with assumptions about my age. It seems to begin in earnest when someone reaches their s.Finding work after the impact of the lockdowns is a massive challenge, and huge source of anxiety, for millions of people. Those who are older, I suspect, will find their age a source of subtle discrimination, regardless of their actual abilities and family responsibilities.And the key word here is lsquosubtlersquo. Few employers will say out loud that they think someone is too old for a job, eventhey have the abilities to do it well. There is anti-discriminatory legislation in place now to prevent that. So itrsquos unspoken and structural ndash the discrimination is so ingrained that most of us donrsquot see it or realise discrimination is taking place. Its most powerful effect is the internalisation of it by older people themselves, who donrsquot even apply for jobs they know they are fully qualied and able to do, because of the fear they will be seen as ldquotoo old.I myself have only come to understand this as I have grown older and experienced it personally. I was once young, of course, as all older people were, and I was as guilty as anyone  of judging older people because of their age when I had youth on my side. So I speak from no moral high ground and some may say itrsquos just the way of things.Thatrsquos the pernicious nature of this kind of discrimination: it can be seen as a sad but inevitable rite of passage part of the circle of le in which we will inevitably be marginalised by society in a host of dferent ways as we get older.But I donrsquot believe it need be this way, and part of changing it is talking honestly about it, and calling it out when it happens. Age is just one part of who we are. It doesnrsquot completely define us or our abilities, capabilities or suitability for a job or le responsibility. And let us not forget that age discrimination doesnrsquot only affect older folk. Young people, including teenagers, can suffer from it too from older people.There are cultures which revere the contribution and abilities of older people, rather than dismiss or diminish them letrsquos try and make our society one of them. I donrsquot say this for me, but for everyone out there who is experiencing that gradual push into the margins they feel they just have to accept, regardless of what they can actually do.Itrsquos about inter-generational respect and it has to go both ways to be effective. In a sense, we would all be winners with this change, as we all learn,we are lucky enough to become older, that time truly does fly."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraiser-raises-700-walk-scott-foundation","story":"Iain Donaldson-Elder, , a former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil, participated in this yearrsquos recent Walk with Scott.Walkers covered  miles across East Lothian and Iain joined at Haddington as they made their way to the town rugby club after following the Longniddry to Haddington railway walk.Accompanied by Jim Liddle, from Leuchie House, a respite centre near North Berwick for people with MS and other long-term conditions, Iain ldquorolled his wheelchair for about three miles and was delighted to receive a certicate as a Scotter of the Year from Councillor Colin McGinn.Iain told the Courier: ldquoThe walk itself was wonderful, emotional and, although short, very rewarding as I got to meet people that I had only known through Facebook.

One of the first books I remember was a battered old hardback collection of legends about the British Isles that my grandmother would read to me by the fire on dark autumn nights. It set me up for a letime of fascination with mythologies from across the world. Once ancient Celtic and British tales had whetted my appetite, I was off to Greece to meet Zeus, then on to Rome to spend time with Romulus and from there my travels took to me to Egypt with Isis and Osiris, Sumer and the wild adventures of Gilgamesh, then onto the lands of the Norse with Loki at Ragnarok.Irsquove been travelling in space and time through mythology for decades now ndash discovering the lives and minds of ancient people in the Americas, Africa and the South Seas. So I gleefully paw my way through any new anthology when it appears ndash looking for something fresh, some tale or insight Irsquove yet to discover, all the while hoping that each new book that arrives will inspire others to fall in love with the foundation stories which shape the remarkable tale of human le.Jeffs is at her best when shersquos sting through the soil of ancient mythology for nuggets of truth, trying to uncover what fact may lie within a myth. Itrsquos a hard job, like uncovering the microscopic grain of grit which formed the pearl inside an oyster. The study of the truths which lie within myths is known as Euhemerism. The best example is the myth of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks discovered the skulls of mammoths lying buried deep under their fields. When these huge skulls were excavated, they appeared to have one giant eye in the middle of the forehead ndash itrsquos where the trunk wouldrsquove been. However, Ancient Greeks, unaware of long dead beasts called mammoths, assumed these were the skulls of a giant with one eye ndash and up grew stories of the Cyclops. Likewise, the legend of the Gryphon ndash that strange bird-monster of mythology ndash began in central Asia where the fossilised nests of dinosaurs were found by ancient peoples, together with eggs and the bones of creatures that seemed like giant, monstrous birds.Jeffs takes us back to the foundation of Britain when legend tells us that mysterious people from the east settled our islands. First comes Albina, the rebellious daughter of a king from the lands where Syria now sits. Not long after the Flood, shersquos cast out by her father and lands in Britain ndash gting us the name of ldquoAlbion for the entirety of the British Isles. Later, Brutus, a descendant of Troy searching for a home, arrives on these shores. He gives us the name ldquoBritain, corrupted from ldquoBrutus.We know that the people who first settled these islands did indeed come from somewhere to the east. Ancient DNA tells us that. So, is there some cultural memory echoing within these myths that Jeffs tells  Are these legends a remnant of ancient migration  Do they tell a story about the very mixed blood which runs through our mongrel veins The legends of the Scots have eastern echoes too. If you read the text of the  Declaration of Arbroath, yoursquoll see references made by the authors to those who founded Scotland coming from ldquoGreater Scythia via the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of Hercules, and living in Spain among the fiercest tribes for many years. That implies a journey from the Russian steppe via the Med, past Gibraltar to the western shores of Spain. Jeffs tells of Scota, the foreign queen who settled first in Ireland and gave her name to the tribe, the Scotti, whorsquod one day settle Scotland. In Scotarsquos myth she travels from the eastern Mediterranean to Spain, then on to Ireland. History shows that the Irish ldquoScotti tribe eventually came to dominate Scotland. Scota had a son called Hyber ndash he gives his name to Hiberniaand the Iberian peninsula.Studies of ancient DNA have linked northern Spain and Portugal to Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall ndash old Celtic lands. Our myths contain hints of something deep that wersquoll never understand ndash stories about migration from east to west, of a staging post in Spain, of settlement in these islands, thought to be the very end of the world in ancient times. It makes the mind wander. What brought these people all the way here  Might perhaps the survivors of a shattered civilisation ndash even Troy, which we know today did exist as a city and was destroyed in the Bronze Age ndash have made their way here more than , years ago to build a new le  Is that what these myths ndash layered by millennia of retelling ndash whisper For this strange frisson of partially glimpsed knowledge, Jeffsrsquos book is worth the cover price alone. And yet, as a work on British mythology this beautul book issomewhat lacking. Although itrsquos built chronologically, starting back in prehistory and working forward to the time of the Picts then William the Conqueror, the book is strangely compiled. Therersquos a looseness about the story selection, a slightness to the tellings.At times, the tales donrsquot hang together as a collection. The sense of a unying mythos is missing as yoursquod expect with a primer on Greek, Roman or Norse legends. Some stories start and end randomly. Therersquos also a feyness ndash almost diaphanous dreaminess ndash to the writing which seems misplaced. Feyness is for fairy tales ndash and myths arenrsquot fairy tales. Myths are rough beasts. Jeffs, who has the elegant hand of an artist as proved by her gorgeous linocut illustrations, should perhaps have been harsher, more direct in her tellings."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-bowie-stephen-flynn-christine-jardine-appear-brian-taylor-podcast","story":"With the Supreme Court ruling, the Conservative party conference and the NHS, host Brian Taylor and Alistair Grant of The Heralds political team have taken listeners through the latest in Scottishpolitics with the help of an expert political .This week, we have appearances from:Listeners to the podcast have access to an exclusive subscription discount code, entitling them to % off our incredible annual rate, heard only through the live stream and recorded episodes.There are a few ways you can listen to all the episodes of The Brian Taylor Podcast so far.Apple PodcastsThe podcast is available on Apple Podcasts -you have an iPhone, iPad, Macbook or another Apple product, download the Apple Podcasts app.Either click the button above or click this link to be directed straight to our podcast home and get the latest episode.Make sure you hit the subscribe button and be instantly notied whenever we publish a new episode.SpotyThis podcast is also available on Spoty.

Wersquove been exchanging the occasional gt for more than  years now. Not only did the book take twice as long to reach him as it did before Brexit, but he had to collect it from the sorting office and pay euro customs charges. The value of the item on the customs declaration form was pound. If this is how Brexit can affect a private inidual, what is it like for those who are trying to export to EU countries All this could have been avoided by the UK leaving the EU but remaining in the single market and customs union. It has now become equally obvious that lack of freedom of movement of people has landed the UK with its huge labour shortage. Expect more special work visas to be issued as the truth begins to bite in many sectors of the economy.Itrsquos the denials which I find bizarre. Anyone with half a brain can see that Brexit has been bad news for the UK. Wersquove treated our European allies like dirt, created major dficulties for UK export businesses, damaged the lives of UK citizens settled in EU countries , got into yet another mess with Northern Ireland, and shown Britain to be untrustworthy when it comes to signed agreements.Irsquom still waiting for some honest reservations to be uttered by those who voted Leave, evenpride prevents them from offering the actual apology that we Remainers deserve.Dave Stewart, Glasgow.HAVE FAITH IN FELLOW SCOTSROBERT IG Scottasks ldquowhat benefits would Scotland derive from the SNPrsquos dream of independence . It is a simple question requiring a voluminous answer and to simply the answer, I say look at similar-sized countries of Europe and where. Naturally SNP supporters wish to see Scotland become independent, but there are many voters from other parties who also support independence and will vote accordingly when the time comes.The Little Englander view of the UK is somewhat inward-looking as it is not only the UK which is multi-cultural but the wider world. Look beyond UK borders and blue passports and have faith in your fellow Scots to make a go of things.Independence would change everything and give the people some hope from the real mess created under successive Westminster governments over a long period of time. More of the same is our future right now and how much better to ldquotake back control and run ourselves with a government chosen from parties standing only in Scotland whether that be SNP, Conservative, Labour or from other newly-formed parties. In Scotlandrsquos past history lies our future.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.BORDERS THAT REALLY HURTROBERT IG Scott would like the Scotland England border to be consigned to the history books with the UK retained in its present form for ever more. He fails to share his attitude to Brexit through which the voters south of that border in his beloved UK have imposed a border at the English Channel and another across the island of Ireland, casting us adrt from our fellow Europeans and endangering both the hard-won peace settlement in Ireland and the fellowship among the major European nations which the EU had brought about.The EU was as precious to me and millions of others as the UK is to Mr Scott.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.BENEFITS OF INDEPENDENCEROBERT IG Scott asks what benefits Scotland would derive from restoring its independence. Letrsquos start with the most obvious. It would give us a government that is directly accountable to the people of Scotland, meaning we would no longer suffer rule by a government we didnrsquot vote for, and havenrsquot, since .Second, it would give us control over our economy. We would be able to set our own interest rates and make tax, spending and investment decisions for the benefit of Scotland, not England. We could keep our money and not have to send half to Westminster. We could eliminate poverty, raise the miserly state pension, invest in health, education, social care and a greener economy, creating millions of good well-paid jobs.Third, it would give us control over our considerable natural resources ndash oil, renewables, forestry, fishing, and land. Had we managed our oil ourselves, we could have created a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway did, to secure the future of generations of Scots. We canrsquot allow Westminster to steal our renewables and water as climate change accelerates.Fourth, independence means we could make our own foreign policy, and not be ripped from the worldrsquos largest free trading bloc against our will. We could manage our defence at a much lower cost and remove weapons of mass destruction from our soil. We could sign international agreements like the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child without being slapped down for exceeding our authority.The benefits of reclaiming our sovereignty are overwhelming. Lets get on with it.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.NO CLEAR INDY MANDATEFRASER Grantrefers to the May Scottish Parliament election results and how the fact that the SNP won  seats as against only  by the other parties and says that provides a clear mandate for Indyref.While these statistics are accurate, further examination shows that the  seats were won with . per cent of the total votes cast in the constituency vote. The SNP won .% of the total votes cast in the regional vote and of the combined votes cast in both elements of the election the SNP won .% of the total. While this shows strong support for the SNP it clearly does not demonstrate a clear mandate for Indyref.Simply repeating the claim \"we have a clear cast-iron mandate for Indyref\" does not make it become true.James Hamilton, Glasgow.PUT SEPARATION ON BALLOTSWHILE I sympathise with Jill Stephensons frustration with the distortion caused by leading referendum questionsI fear that her well-meaning intention to rebalance a second referendum question for it to say \"lsquoShould Scotland remain in the UK  Yes or No\" would have unforeseen repercussions.Indyref is often spoken about as a simple repeat of Indyref and most ordinary people who dont follow the exact minutiae of politics would assume the same and look at it in the context of their last vote on the same subject. For No to become Yes and Yes to become No would only confuse people. I can well imagine tens of thousands of people thinking that they were reaffirming support for the same thing as they did last time ndash or registering that theyve changed their mind from last time ndash only to realise afterwards that they were actually voting for the exact opposite of what they wanted.I agree with Ms Stephenson that the pro-nationalist phrasing of the  vote was unfair, but we have to play the hand weve been dealt ndash to change could actually skew results even further. If there is to be a second referendum, andit is to have a \"Yes No\" question, it will have to be the same one as last time.Ideally though the least ambiguous answers should be statements of what would actually happen. Accepting that \"Remain Leave\" has been contaminated by the Brexit debate and cannot be used, \"Union Separation\"would be more direct and less judgemental than \"Yes No\".Robert Frazer, Dundee.* FOLLOWING on from the contribution from Peter A RussellI propose the referendum ballot paper should consist of two boxes: one marked ldquoIndependence and the other marked ldquoDependence.The latter seems to be a good description of the state most supporters of the status quo consider Scotland to be in.This should overcome the ldquoYes bias issue to everyonersquos satisfaction.Cameron Crawford, Rothesay.VERILY A DING-DONGI ALWAYS enjoy the political ding-dong on your Letters Pages: the Tories criticising everything about Scotland, loathing the SNP, and now those dreadful Greens too, and the independence supporters hitting back with their forceful responses.The saddest letters are from Labour supporters.

We are committed to ensuring our people who keep our communities connected are properly rewarded, particularly after their contribution to the country over the past  months of the pandemic.“We have worked tirelessly to protect the jobs of our people during the pandemic and done everything we reasonably can to hold constructive discussions with Unite to reach a sensible and sustainable pay agreement across our bus depots.“We are leaving no stone unturned in a bid to reach a settlement. That is why we are putting a fresh pay offer to Unite in talks scheduled to take place next week.”According to Stagecoach, bus services are facing a continuing challenging financial environment with passenger levels signicantly down on pre-COVID levels. Passenger fares are signicantly short of what is needed to cover the day-to-day costs of running services without Scottish Government support.Mr Beaton added: “We would urge Unite to end the uncertainty for our people and the customers who rely on bus services.“Strike action is completely unnecessary and would simply damage the lives and livelihoods of hard-working people, including our employees, as well as the region’s businesses.#We would urge Unite to put communities first and talk, not walk.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4142135.jpg--.jpg?1633698699000\n","title":"portglenone firm launch innovative new coffin pod","story":"A Portglenone hearse building firm has credited the support received from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in helping secure funding to launch an innovative ‘Coffin Pod’ which will help protect grieving families and funeral directors as the COVID- pandemic continues.Family-owned Quinn Hearse  Limousines have specialised in the design and manufacture of hearses and limousines for over a quarter of a century, and currently employ  staff.The company’s revolutionary new product has been launched following extensive market research after Quinn’s were awarded the Innovate NI Gold Standard accreditation.The Coffin Pod is a sealed glass pod which will allow funeral directors to transport coffins safely, and allow families to have open coffin wakes while observing social distancing measures.The development of the new product has been made possible with the support of a network of stakeholders, including the council’s Economic Development team, Innovate UK and Invest NI.Patrick Quinn, Company Director, said: “Innovation and new product development have been core to the business’s continued success. We had the idea to develop the Coffin Pod, after seeing the impact that Covid- was having on families being unable to properly mourn for their loved ones and to protect funeral directors in transport to their final resting place. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have supported us through the process of applying for the Innovate UK Challenge Fund to address the current and future impacts of Covid-.

PressEyeMichael DonnellyOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe trial of former soldier Dennis Hutchings – who is accused of the shooting of a Co Tyrone man nearly  years ago – could be concluded as early as next week, a judge revealed on Monday.Outlining publicly the progress of the trial, Mr Justice O#Hara said the prosecution case against the -year-old former Le Guardsman should be completed by this Wednesday, andachieved this would lead to legal submissions on Friday.Mr Justice O#Hara said he would then rule on Monday what prosecution evidence was deemed admissible, and – dependant on the ruling – this may lead to further defence applications.Read MoreDennis Hutchings trial: Military police who attended scene of shooting say they remember little or nothing of that dayIt had been estimated the trial could last at least four weeks, as it sits only every other day to allow Mr Hutchings, diagnosed as suffering from an incurable chronic kidney disease, to receive treatment and rest in the intervening two days.Before his announcement, Mr Justice O#Hara, by agreement, continued the case for a time in Mr Hutchings’ absence, initially to allow him to “get some air” and then when told he needed to retire to his hotel for rest.The former colour sergeant from Cawsand, in Cornwall, denies attempting to murder John Patrick Cunningham and attempting to cause the -year-old, described as a vulnerable man with the “mind of a child”, grievous bodily harm.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Former MP and Le Guardsman Lieutenant Colonel Dr Charles Goodson-Wicks had gone to the field at Carrickaness Road, on the outskirts of Benburb village where #John Pat#, as he was known, was fatally shot.Yesterday he told Belfast Crown Court that save for his original statement, he had nothing to add or subtract from it after such a long period of time.However, Dr Goodson-Wickes agreed with prosecution QC Charles MacCreanor that his original statement made on June , , the day of the shooting, was truthful, and that his memory of events would indeed have been fresher then.Later he went on tell the defence he remembered Mr Hutchings very well from his time in the Le Guards.He said he thought it relevant to say to the court, given his own military experience of over half a century, that  asked to name someone who was the epitome of the best part of senior British NCO , the name of Mr Hutchings would come readily to mind”.The retired doctor, who has also been a barrister, said when he arrived at the scene he found field dressings had been applied to Mr Cunningham#s wounds in an effort to preserve le. He could not sayMr Hutchings had personally applied them, but that he certainly would have supervised the application.Then when questioned about the firing of warning shots by soldiers he said while personally he could not answer that directly he would say, as in any military operation it would be a prudent measure ... to fire a warning shot rather then a shot to maim or cause further injury.Later, despite defence objections, Dr Goodson-Wickes was asked about his own knowledge of the Army#s then rules of engagement contained on the so-called #yellow card#, setting out rules when soldiers could open fire.The former MP said his recollection would be very rusty, although he may have been briefed on on the matter, but that was some  years ago and that he had never refreshed his memory on it.Mr MacCreanor, for the prosecution, pointed out the card said nothing about warning shots and the rules said only that such shots fired are to be aimed shots.Later he told Mr Justice O#Hara he remembered seeing Mr Hutchings at the scene, and also what he was doing at the time.He said he assumed that Mr Hutchings was the patrol commander and gathering up the aftermath at the scene.The case resumes tomorrow.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsBelfast restaurant Top Blade launches appeal to reunite owner with lace thongQueen’s University students get fines of more than £, for breaking Covid rules‘Google Me’ loyalist thug threatened to burn out farmerNI model Zara Doherty: ‘It became a choice between heroin and my child.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The campaign aims to shine a light on older people and provide them with an opportunity to engage with a wide range of organisations and activities that offer support services and opportunities to socialise and learn new skills. googletag.cmd.push Derry City  Strabane District Council, the Western Health  Social Care Trust and the Public Health Agency have come together to create a erse programme of activities and events throughout October and are encouraging ious groups and organisations to get involved. Council is also currently engaging with the older community to shape a dedicated Age Friendly strategy for the City and District, prioritising older people and ensuring their health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the positive development of Derry and Strabane. Work is underway to create an Age Friendly structure with partners and stakeholders to co-design the three-year Age Friendly Strategy and action plan. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, said Positive Ageing Month celebrated the many positive aspects of growing older. He said: Positive Ageing Month offers the chance to celebrate the older members of our community, and the huge influence they have on our society. “The onus is on all of us to respect and engage with older citizens, and really value their lived experience and knowledge they bring to bear when shaping policies and programmes for our Council area.     More people within our local community are living longer, healthier lives, so we must ensure that those later years are enriching and rewarding for growing old in our area. “We must ensure that their needs are identied and prioritised and that we all take a more responsible and positive approach to le as we grow older. I hope to see lots of older people connecting with the programme and the opportunity to enjoy new activities.” Launching the campaign, Seamus Ward, Head of Health Improvement, Western Health  Social Care Trust said: “I am delighted to be launching this years Positive Ageing campaign. It is a great opportunity to showcase the fantastic work being carried out on the ground by older peoples groups and community and voluntary organisations. The programme of events that we have produced shows a iety of activities that exist throughout Derry-Londonderry, Strabane and Limavady areas for older citizens. In an ageing population, it is important we continue to work together to encourage older people to reach out and help them re-connect within their local community, not only to reduce social isolation and loneliness but to help them live long, healthy lives.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

The new greenway will start at St. Columb’s College,through TheHawthorns to Templemore Road and across to Templemore Sports Complex to UpperGalliaghRoad. The development will continue along the line of the former LoughSwillyrailway line, acrossSkeogeLink Road, and on toElaghBusiness Park. googletag.cmd.push Planning officers had providedseven reasons for refusal. One highly discussed reason to refuse was that the new greenway would run through Zoned HA housing lands. Sinn Fein Councillor Christopher Jackson said: “This is a greenway and something we have been promoting right across our city and district as a positive piece of infrastructure to allow people to choose more sustainable modes of transport.If there is zoned housing there, we should be incorporating the greenway through it.” Head of Planning Maura Fox explained: “The proposal is on housing zoned land. By severing the site with one aspect of the development, you are potentially disallowing houses in part of the zoning which has already been protected for housing.” Ken O’Sullivan, Project Manager, speaking on behalf of the Council said: “We know that the housing master plans for these lands is not yet available and we believe our proposals could be easily incorporated into any future housing masterplans on the lands.” After y debate, Councillors voted nine against refusing the planning officer’s recommendation to refuse, with four voting to for refusing the application.     The Councillors approved the application to go ahead, with conditions. The application had been previously deferred in July this year to allow for a site visit. This proposed greenway will be a part of a wide range of new greenway connections between Derry and the South.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The new greenway will start at St. Columb’s College,through TheHawthorns to Templemore Road and across to Templemore Sports Complex to UpperGalliaghRoad. The development will continue along the line of the former LoughSwillyrailway line, acrossSkeogeLink Road, and on toElaghBusiness Park. googletag.cmd.push Planning officers had providedseven reasons for refusal. One highly discussed reason to refuse was that the new greenway would run through Zoned HA housing lands. Sinn Fein Councillor Christopher Jackson said: “This is a greenway and something we have been promoting right across our city and district as a positive piece of infrastructure to allow people to choose more sustainable modes of transport.If there is zoned housing there, we should be incorporating the greenway through it.” Head of Planning Maura Fox explained: “The proposal is on housing zoned land. By severing the site with one aspect of the development, you are potentially disallowing houses in part of the zoning which has already been protected for housing.” Ken O’Sullivan, Project Manager, speaking on behalf of the Council said: “We know that the housing master plans for these lands is not yet available and we believe our proposals could be easily incorporated into any future housing masterplans on the lands.” After y debate, Councillors voted nine against refusing the planning officer’s recommendation to refuse, with four voting to for refusing the application.     The Councillors approved the application to go ahead, with conditions. The application had been previously deferred in July this year to allow for a site visit. This proposed greenway will be a part of a wide range of new greenway connections between Derry and the South.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

He achieved the incredible feat on the tenth anniversary of his father Colm’s death, and in doing so created a groundswell of support locally and nationally. His efforts have inspired the community, so much so that donations have continued to pour in in the weeks after he finished, leading to the pound, mark being surpassed on Saturday. “This has been one of the hardest and most rewarding few months in my le,” Danny said “I feel like a broken record here but once again, I am simply in awe of the generosity, gratitude and charity of the people of Derry and Donegal. “To everyone that donated from the businesses that had the means to donate large sums right down to the men and women throwing in a pound here and there. All of it has added up to this. “Anyone that handed my family and friends their change while in the bar and asked for it to be donated, up in Broslashn,you dropped a few quid into their mason jar after a meal,you took part in the Sandwich Co’s breakfast fundraiser oryou bought one of the Iron Man cocktails down at the Taphouse! and of course all of the people that liked, shared and donated on FB, Instagram or Twitter.     “All of you have helped out and all of you played your part in raising this money, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. “A special thank you to Joe Mc Kane and Odhran Mc Kane and the McKane family for being with me every step of the way. Georgie Harkin, Seamus Crossan, Stephen Quigley for being in high spirits. “A special thank you of course to the Bogside and Brandywell Health Forum - they’ve done so much and will continue to do so after my work in raising the money is complete. “And of course a special thank you to my friends family and all of the people that were down supporting.

Well done, Danny!”  The Mayor Alderman Graham Warke who hosted a reception in recognition of Danny Quigley who completed  triathlons in  days, in memory of his father Colm Quigley, who died by suicide  years ago.

She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Ambition is important. Yes, that’s true. Without a level of ambition, in the modern world, we would probably be lost. We wouldn’t be sure where to go or what to do next and of course what we would like to accomplish. googletag.cmd.push The word ambition has a dferent meaning for everyone. For one person it may mean to be in good health. For another, it may mean to rise to the top of the corporate ladder. Or maybe you want to be the best parent you can be. But sometimes, ambition makes us blind and we lose sight of the reasons behind this initial ambition. Chasing something is an example of how we lose sight in the fog of ambition. Where it turns to: “I don’t have enough in le currently or presently”. Be it, more cars, more money, more houses etc. This is where ambition turns to the need for more and more. The want of “more” unfortunately will never satisfy any of us. It may have its fleeting moments of happiness where the ego becomes your shadow side - meaning that it is lurking somewhere in the background, having more control over your thoughts, feelings and actions than you may initially think. Ego is important. I would argue that it is detrimental to our happiness and fulfillment, in a physical and mental sense, when we are blinded by the ego and all it wants for us is more of something or maybe even someone.     Our ultimate mission is inidual to each and every one of us however our mission or purpose does share commonalities. We are inspired when we think of our mission. We are frightened of our mission as we are afraid of what we truly know we can accomplish once we put our minds to it. We get a sense of happiness at the thought of our mission being complete. Overall, there may be a procrastinating pull and a satisfactory push when we think of what our purpose is,we have not found it yet or taking action towards it. Society is not designed in a way for us to find our purpose and true calling. We have to go and find it ourselves. Efficiency has led to a personal deficiency where being proactive is admired and recognised more so than a person’s recognition for the need to rest. Let’s look at a question we often ask others: “Are you busy ” Questioning the “busyness” of someone  is a worthwhile example of how we are conditioned into framing conversations and boxing another human being’s value into whether they are “busy” or not. Yes, while it may be a good way to start conversation, I would question this very question as a measure of efficiency in our daily lives as existential as it may be. We have to question these things and examine where we can improve on our ways of interacting socially leading to meaningful friendships and relationships. I don’t mean that on an efficiency level but more on a deeper, human connection level Nobody has this le figured out. Many people are seen to be thought leaders in self-help, for example, but they don’t have it figured out either. Whilst the conceptualisation of certain ideas may provoke thought and conversation , nobody has it fully figured out and each one of us are on our own inidual path. I say this to support the idea that there seems to always be a drive toward efficiency in the modern world and this can now be seen in new thought leadership on self-help. We now have step by step guides, habits, graphs, routines etc. that tell us how to be more efficient - from people who certainly, although maybe experienced, do not have the answers you or I seek. Efficiency, in my eyes, is the curse to simplicity which I believe is one of the keys to living a happy, stress free le. When we strip back layers of the ego’s needs, what are we left with  I would assume that we are left with a very fragile, vulnerable and lost person which is why we need to have a certain level of ego in our lives. However, we can be mindful of what aspects of the ego we tend to build. So in an ego driven world that almost demands efficiency, leads to a spiritual and mental deficiency where we may forget to nurture certain aspects of ourselves. I would advocate a strategy that would be congruent to your overall daily set of values or importantly your sense of purpose or your mission. For example: “My mission is to be a great mother”. Firstly, define what “great mother” means to you. Does it mean fulfilling the basic food, shelter, emotional needs of your child or does it surpass that  Whatever your purpose, define what success means to you, not the world’s demand for efficiency. Overall, an Americanised, McDonalds culture of “getting stuff done” has filtered its way into most of the Western world. Whilst efficiency is welcome in certain aspects of our lives, be it our cars, coffee machines and checkouts - at what point do we press the stop button on a robotic like efficiency that we human beings have also now become accustomed to in our relationship with ourselves and others  It takes strength and often courage to get off the hamster wheel - be it your self-sabotaging belief systems, patterns of destructive behavior, your career, the role in your relationships - however, I would strongly advocate stepping back from the busy demands of le and re-evaluating what it is you really value.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Drumboe left Whitehead in Co Antrim, where it has been restored, early on Saturday on its way to the Donegal Railway Heritage Museum in Donegal Town where it will go on display. googletag.cmd.push The -tonne engine, which travelled on a low-loader, passed through Derry, Strabane, Stranorlar, Ballybofey and Barnesmore Gap, before arriving in Donegal Town. It stopped at the Tinneys in Strabane, the former site of the railway station to which it made its last journey in December . The engine also stopped on Barnesmore Gap, the scene of many iconic photographs of the engine in its heyday. Following its arrivial in Donegal Town, Drumboe will be lted into position on a new presentation  at the museum. The Drumboe engine was one of half a dozen built for the Donegal railways in  and . It has become the iconic steam engine of the era of railways in Donegal.Two years in the making The project tothe engine into the county cost €, with funding from Leader on top of fundraising. Theof the engine has been more than two years in the making. As well as the restoration of the engine, the project has included the building of a new presentation  and canopy at the museum. The manager of the museum Nial McCaughan explained there is a lot of excitement about theof the engine.     “This is a big thing for the museum but also for the county,” he said. “This is the first Donegal steam engine to be back in the county. It’s also the very engine that sadly left on the very last journey on December,   - the very last passenger service that left Donegal Town for Strabane. So it has come full circle - it is coming back to Donegal Town and it is a great thing for us all.” He said there are plans that the engine, which has been restored “from a rusting hulk,” will be run again on tracks in Donegal. Most of the engine has been fully restored to an operational state so that when funding becomes available, it could go back into steam. “We would love to put Drumboe back in operation - that is that plan,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Greacuteasaacuten and Gael Linn – one of the main Irish Language organisations in Ireland – have published an open letter to the Department in North asking them to intervene. The letter was signed by over  teachers, speakers and activists. googletag.cmd.push In it, the letter said the  disapplication of the requirement for all pupils to study an additional language at GCSE, “had detrimental consequences for the study of languages and Irish in particular”. The letter also cited a  per cent reduction of students studying Irish at GCSE level since  and called for the  disapplication to be reversed so that pupils must pick a language as one of their GCSE choices – be it Irish, French, German or Spanish. Sinn Feacutein MLA Delargy said: “I have great admiration and respect for the teachers who have signed this letter and are demanding better from the Department. “The figures presented in the letter make for stark reading, it is clear the emphasis of the curriculum has placed on STEMsubjects over recent years to the detriment of languages. “There have been numerous shortcomings from the Department over the last number of years in relation to the language, these trends must be reversed. “While the Irish medium sector continues to grow unbounded, it’s time to look at the language and other languages within the English Medium Sector.     “Sinn Feacutein supports the demands made in the letter and will engage with the Department as they encourage our pupils to study a language.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Foyle MLA also confirmed that Sinn Feacutein will bring a motion to the Assembly on Monday calling for action to end this crisis. A drop in the number of HGV drivers, due to European workers now seeking work in EU member states following Britains exit from the EU, has led to supermarkets and petrol stations in Great Britain reporting of shortages. googletag.cmd.push The north of Ireland is in a dferent situation as due to it retaining its Single Market status post-Brexit, goods and petrol have been in supply. However, Delargy said the norths own economy needed HGV drivers from the EU to ensure that shoppers and car drivers can still have at-point-access to goods and fuel. He said: “Boris Johnson and his government’s Brexit has created a crisis in the production of agri-food and the transporting of goods through lorry driver shortages. “Alongside the reckless move to end freedom of movement with its xenophobic undercurrents which has seen many EU citizens leaving, the Tories are refusing to recognise the need to ensure skilled workers from across the EU who want to work here can do so. “The British Government needs to find a solution to the problem of labour shortages which they created through their hard Brexit and ensure EU citizens can work in the north. “Sinn Feacutein’s Assembly motion calls on the Economy Minister to put pressure on the British government to act to end the labour shortage crisis and resolve the issues facing workers and local businesses.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The balance on how to create nutritious, easy-to-prepare school lunches five days a week that kids will love too is a continuous challenge. Healthy Heroes, the lunchtime nutrition programme from the Irish Bread Bakers Association and Bord Bia, offers plenty of simple suggestions. googletag.cmd.push Their latest programme is already underway in hundreds of primary schools around the country aiming to help children improve their eating habits for the better and increase their fitness levels. Studies show that just one in ten Irish childrenmeet the national physical activity guidelines, while at least one in five nationally are still overweight or obese. Created by teachers and behaviour change experts, with the support of Dr Mary McCreery, one of Ireland’s leading consultant nutritionists and dieticians, the schools-based lunchtime programme recognises the importance of intervening early so children develop healthy eating behaviours before they leave primary school. It aims to increase the nutritional value of the lunch box with useful tips and suggestions on ways to include fruit and vegetables in lunch boxes as well as easy – to- understand information on the food pyramid and the contents of the ideal lunch box. The programme involves a novel peer learning approach with sixth class students mentoring younger students on the importance of nutrition and being active. This provides the younger children with important role models, while the older children have an opportunity to foster valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. According to Dr McCreery, school lunchtime is an important opportunity to develop positive attitudes towards food choices and nutrition, leading to le-long eating habits. She offersthe following tips to parents when it comes to school lunches:     Set a good example by eating a iety of foods yourself and make your own lunch at the same time so your child knows how much you enjoy them.Introduce new foods without any special comment so your child can make their own mind upthey like them or not. Make sure you have a wide range of foods available at home. Try to offer dferent foods every day. Shopping in advance is the best way to ensure you have plenty of iety for lunch boxes. Include a carbohydrate, a protein, dairy, fruit, and veg in their lunch boxes. To provide a balanced diet educate your child that treats are for weekends and special occasions. Involve your child in the food shopping to encourage themto pick healthy options for their school lunch. And here are some balanced lunch suggestions from the latest Healthy Heroes programme.

A European Studies student from Waterford, Maireacutead Butler, will use the opportunity to raise awareness with Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin about the challenges still facing girls and women. Speaking about the event, Maireacutead said it isnt good enough that no woman has ever held the office of Taoiseach, but that she was delighted to be part of the takeover. googletag.cmd.push She said, I hope girls across the country will see this and be able to envision themselves in this office one day. The  year old, who is a member of Plan International Irelands Youth Advisory Panel, will also discuss the results of the groups recent research into sexual and reproductive health misinformation in Irish schools. She said, Im grateful to have the opportunity to present the findings to the Taoiseach today.Most concerning were the responses we received about consent, contraception and LGBTI+ identities. “The reality is that when young people are not armed with the right info on sexual and reproductive health, girls and young women are at particular risk of being subjected to sexual and gender-based violence and early pregnancy. Similar takeover events are taking place around the world today, giving girls and young women the chance to sit in the seats of leaders in politics and business, particularly traditionally male-dominated positions.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

A source close to the country star has said It becomes a big story for Garthhe gets the five nights at Croke Park he was denied before. Three nights won’t be enough. googletag.cmd.push He wants his full five shows at leasthe is ever toto Ireland. Hundreds of residents in the Croke Park area met beside the venue last week with stadium management and Aiken Promotions with concerns over the amount of concerts being planned. Residents are outraged that there could be seven potential concerts held next year and it could go to the High Court, but Dublin City Council could still refuse as they did back in . As it stands under restrictions, only three gigs can take place in Croke Park in a calendar year between January and February. As there has not been a live show in Croke Park since July , Aiken Promotions have been hoping that this would allow them room to negotiate for more gigs in . Garth Brooks May Move Gigs To Aviva If  Croker Nights Falls Through - https:t.co JfNXSWs pic qjsWujjA — Radio Nova  October ,     Pending this decision, insiders say that Brooks is willing to move some of his shows to the Aviva Stadium,hes request for five nights at Croker is denied. “But Garth could do three nights in Croke Park then another three concerts in the Aviva Stadium”,the source continued.     “He could do what Ed Sheeran did in  and add in even more concerts around the regions. This is also causing issues as Sheeran himself has booked two concerts in April . Research has shown that each Brooks gig could possibly generate €million to the local economy. Another study also showed that one concert ticket sold for a Brooks concert would provide € spent in the local area. “They remained steadfast before, and there’s no reason to think they’ll cave in to Garth this time”. “DCC are more into bicycles than heavy lorries so it doesn’t take much imagination to get their view on a fleet of heavy artics rolling in and out of Croke Park for an unprecedented numbers of concerts, added the source. The country singeris already pencilled in to perform in Croke Park for September ,  and  in .Applications have already been lodged to get two extra dates added to this.

Conor has dabbled in open mike nights over the years with great feedback however found himself struggling to find the confidence to next the next step into the world of gigging. googletag.cmd.push However, after multiple lockdowns, playing his acoustic guitar within the confines of his home, he took plunge and into the world of gigging and hasn’t looked back since. Conor’s book is open for bookings for weekday and weekend slots throughout the Northwest Like most of us, Conor’s le grinded to a halt during COVID. Not being able to do the things he loved he decided once again to wipe the dust off his old guitar and give this singing thing a go. Luckily for Conor his work from home schedule at times wasn’t overly demanding so he found himself homing in on his guitar skills between meetings. He credits both his music and his love of the outdoors for keeping his sanity throughout the winter lockdown of . A keen swimmer, Conor found himself using the cold water, taking regular dips in Enagh Lough throughout the week to stay present and focused, alleviating the worries and uncertainty that gripped the nation during COVID times. Coming out the far side Conor sees exciting times ahead for himself. “COVID had really made me realise that the most important thing in le is to do the things that really get me excited.     “Le is short and tomorrow it could be gone, so don’t take anything for granted. “I’ve discovered my love for music and live performing and this is something I really want to peruse.

Fronted by Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite, they confidently wander the border between Indie Rock and Americana — sounding like a long overdue meeting of the minds of Pinegrove, Frightened Rabbit and Julien Baker AND THEY release “Where We All End Up In The End” on October . The album will be released in its entirety on Bandcamp on  October, followed by single releases on DSPs each month thereafter. To give listeners a taste of the album, smallmint will perform a streamed album launch gig on  October and release the fourth and final single ‘Pseudonym’ on DSPs on  October. I don’t know for sure but I’m going to say that DSPs are download streaming s. Hot Press have said The layered production, melodic guitar hooks and enthralling dynamics come together to form a striking and powerful sound and they know a thing or two. The Last Mixed Tape have said A well-crafted piece of songwriting, the bands sound moves dynamically with each twist in the song’s tail”, but I don’t believe they’re the actual last mixed tape and Chorblossom have predictably said Drenched in dreamy Americana vibes, Liv is a superb second single from smallmint, I’d love to see them rip into someone meself. ‘Where we all end up in the end’ began le in , when live tracking commenced at Smalltown America Studios in Derry. Smallmint worked closely together with producer Caolaacuten Austin to achieve the sound on the record. Frontman Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite wears his emotional intricacies on his sleeve through his vocal delivery and upfront lyricism, all set to a musical backdrop of crunchy electric guitars and pounding drums. The result is a confident statement of intent — a testament to the band’s hard work, musicianship, and their own high standards. He said: “We wanted the album to feel natural and to actually sound like a band playing live in a room, which is exactly how it was recorded. It was important for us to keep that space and energy in the recordings - no need for overproduction or too many overdubs, we wanted to let the arrangement of the music by the band, and the lyrics speak for themselves.” Check them out on facebook smallmintband or instagram smallmintband or even www  smallmintbandADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs. It provides basic shelter, comfort and security.

Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms.

However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago.

My parents and I got the chance to meet him in Dublin the day after the Brexit vote.ldquoIrsquom more likely to ask him nowhersquos going over to Ireland, would he give me a lt on Air Force One, he joked.Cormac is still not behind the door connecting with famous people with his red hair helping him engage with TV host and producer mdash and fellow redhead mdash Conan OrsquoBrien when the former Hard student gave an address to new students.ldquoThe rest of the guys suggested we get a picture together as we look alike but he was great fun. The best thing was that I was wearing my Red High GAA shirt, said Cormac.While he has taken Hard and the US to his heart, Cormac retains his real love for his home.ldquoIrsquove really loved the adventure of having to adapt to the American culture and my three best friends here are all Americans.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London.

Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds.

It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

mdash A major new drive has been launched to attract private investment in a planned multi-million pound facelt for Newcastle.Down Council is targeting a host of major private firms in a bid to interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what le is like in a community with nothing.From a world that is void of any luxuries and running short on basic necessities, African visitors from Malawi, brought their gt of song to St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar.Nine representatives from a primary school, a hospital and a church of the Embangweni Station sang Malawian songs and shared stories about their home with the pupils.With the aim of the visit to share cultures the visitors were offered Irish stew and watched the pupils perform Irish dancing.The school children were amazed to hear how their guests had never been on a plane, boat or train before and how they only earn around pound a year.School principal, Mr Harry Murray, said he was delighted to have the visitors at the school so his students could hear for themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative image of the area.He claimed both councillors asked for a decision to approve expansion work at the plant to be deferred on ldquohearsay evidence and suggested they never checked what he described as the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a petition containing , signatures in support of the controversial development at the Gocean.The plan to develop a -acre site, including a new marina, has split public opinion in the town, but local community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13091446.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularAlmost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin Swann‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyPUP annual conference: Billy Hutchinson tells members that ‘shared island is a hood’Thousands of chickens killed as NIFRS tackle large shed fire at Northern Ireland farmPaddle boarders rescued in leboat and coastguard emergency operation off Ballintoy in north AntrimMost PopularLord Frost and Simon Coveney in NI Protocol twitter spatHenry McDonald: Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’‘A message to the IRA man who killed my brother: you have wasted your le’Pan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expectedBen Lowry: Echoes of , as Boris Johnson fails to proclaim his unionism in his keynote speech to Tories                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The resulting health crisis shows the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. The tendency to shirk responsibility, to think short-term and to ignore hard choicesOn Saturday, I fell off my bicycle and smashed my left wrist. As a result, firstly I was sedated and given a procedure to stabilise and reposition the bone. Then, the next morning, my joint was rebuilt during several hours of surgery at Royal Victoria Hospital. I’ve written about the NHS quite a bit over the years. But an up close and personal experience always helps put things in a sharper perspective.That’s primarily because, as a patient, you can’t help but be struck by the kindness, dedication and professionalism of almost every member of staff you meet in hospital.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...They really are remarkable people, with reserves of caring and empathy that most of us can only wonder at. It’s all the more impressive that they display these qualities under such challenging circumstances.For example, the nurses who show endless reserves of patience through the small hours of the night while they are abused and sometimes even threatened by distressed patients. These are often older people, confused and delirious, who are not in any way responsible for their behaviour, but they still say hurtful, potentially intimidating things. It’s a special skill to be able to deal with that, calmly and firmly, in the middle of a busy sht.When you are in hospital receiving care, you see that staff are working incredibly hard, often without breaks, while remaining helpful, interested and sympathetic to every patient. But there are dficulties with the system too. It is busy and struggling to cope.I was unfortunate, or perhaps not, that I had an open wound on my broken joint. There was a risk that it would become infected and that was why I had my operation quickly. The surgeons were blunt that,it hadn’t been for the cut, I would probably have had to wait much longer. Indeed, many patients were waiting considerable s of time, some of them in terrible pain, for essential operations on broken legs, hips and other bones or joints. The lists for emergency surgery are long and growing.There is clearly considerable pressure on beds, with some people waiting in discomfort in A  E or in inappropriate wards or bays. But, at the same time, it can be a y and frustrating process being discharged, even after that decision has been taken and plans have been made to fill the bed. Everybody’s doing their jobs with the utmost professionalism, but there are snags and bottlenecks that hold everything up and give an impression of inefficiency.For an explanation, we have to go back to Stormont and the failure of successive health ministers to reform the NHS in Northern Ireland. Since at least , and the Transforming Your Care report, but arguably as long ago as  when the late Maurice Hayes published his recommendations, experts have repeatedly pointed out what needs to happen.We know that there should be a smaller number of acute hospitals with a greater concentration of expertise and more resources should be directed at providing care in the community. In addition, there are dficulties with staffing, particularly in certain jobs and specialties. Rather than act on these requirements, the executive at Stormont repeatedly delayed taking necessary but potentially unpopular decisions.In , the Donaldson Report made specic recommendations to close facilities and reorganise services. It was parked, due to one of Stormont’s periodic crises, and when the assembly got back to some sort of normality, in , the new minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill, commissioned a new review, Bengoa, which made broadly the same points, but presented them in more general terms. It’s an endless, circular process sustained by politicians who refuse to take responsibility for dficult decisions, like closing smaller hospitals. The latest incumbent at the health ministry, Robin Swann, has had to deal with Covid, so you can understand perhaps why reform has not taken priority, but no great change seems imminent. Remember that, just before coronavirus arrived, in December , there was already a nurses’ strike and medics predicted that the system was close to breakdown.The pattern is clear, and Stormont’s refusal to act has allowed NI’s NHS to become outdated in comparison with services in the rest of the UK. Our politicians have let down its brilliant employees badly and repeatedly. Indeed, the crisis in health offers a neat case-study of many of the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. Their tendency to encourage shirking responsibility, thinking only about the short-term, taking the easiest choices and ignoring more dficult ones, blaming everybody .Unavoidably, the unionist parties’ most pressing problem at the next election is the protocol. However, in terms of making Stormont work, an honest, responsible approach to government that confronts long-term problems, rather than denying or ignoring them, is something that voters will think is long overdue.Royal Victoria HospitalNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularAlmost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin Swann‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyPUP annual conference: Billy Hutchinson tells members that ‘shared island is a hood’Thousands of chickens killed as NIFRS tackle large shed fire at Northern Ireland farmPaddle boarders rescued in leboat and coastguard emergency operation off Ballintoy in north AntrimMost PopularLord Frost and Simon Coveney in NI Protocol twitter spatHenry McDonald: Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’‘A message to the IRA man who killed my brother: you have wasted your le’Pan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expectedBen Lowry: Echoes of , as Boris Johnson fails to proclaim his unionism in his keynote speech to Tories                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was also right to oppose an Irish language act.There have been times more recently when UUP politicians have seemed too flexible on contentious issues, at a time when NI’s place in the UK is under overt but also covert attack.It was good on Saturday to see Mr Beattie speak so firmly against the NI Protocol, as he did at the Tory conference in Manchester last week, alongside the DUP and TUV leaders.As he says, it does great damage to the successes of the  Belfast Agreement.It was good also to hear the health minister Robin Swann speaking so emphatically about his opposition to the protocol legal impediment to the movement of NHS drugs into NI.Meanwhile, Lord Frost is still taking a firm public line against the Irish Sea border.Let us hope this all brings results.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
