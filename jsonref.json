In 2018, 178mm fell. In 2019, only 127mm fell.So far in 2020, Wild says more than 500mm has fallen on the cattle and wheat property.Photographs Wild took in December 2019 and then again in March 2020 show the area escape from a moonscape of rocks, dust and dry creek beds.“It was probably the longest prolonged dry period in recorded history. We really did get to a dire situation with a lot of these townships looking at day zero and not knowing what was going to happen.”Merenele is now run by a caretaker with Benjamin’s father John, 71, and mother Vicky, 70, living in the nearby township of Warren.Benjamin Wild, an occupational therapist and poet, lives in Lismore, but goes back regularly to Merenele.“I had a really strong affinity with nature growing up,” Wild says. “I was very much attuned to it. I used to collect seeds and rocks and fill up my drawers with all the junk I found.”Benjamin was born and raised on the farm with his two older sisters Julia and Kate, and older brother Tom.“It was just a state of freedom but, on reflection, it’s growing up in a workplace. Mum and dad were always around and I’d be out shooting or doing farm work. It becomes ingrained in you.”In a good year, the farm now runs more than 400 Shorthorn Charolais cross cows but by December 2019 as Benjamin returned for Christmas, they had de-stocked to 50.He remembers taking a picture as he entered one of the property’s main grazing paddocks, with a cow in the foreground.“That was a horrible day – hot and windy. We were out feeding all day and it was filthy. It would blow a dog off a chain,” he says.“That day showed just how bad it could get. Dad has been out there all his life and it’s rare that the ground gets stripped back to the bone.”The farm faced a bill of about $10,000 every six weeks just to feed the cattle.“The biggest commitment is just keeping everything alive,” Benjamin says.Wild’s photographs show the paddocks returning to life, and the creeks and rivers of the property and other spots close by filling with rain.Marthaguy Creek that forms the eastern boundary of the property was a place Wild watched black cockatoos and water rats play. He doesn’t see those anymore.“The saddest thing has been the numbers of tree deaths over recent years. That stands out for me.”Wild says the region has always had variable weather – with cycles of wet and dry – but he feels something has changed.“I feel like a tourist in my own town because I go back and see these extreme changes. It would always get to 38 or 40 degrees (centigrade) in the late summer, but recently it’s been getting up into the 45s and 47s for extended periods.“I hear the climate change denial in people, and I ask them when was the last time the Arctic and Antarctic was melting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f0d296870585fd64d69eb735ae875c53656fef4/0_57_3028_1817/master/3028.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=29d6253afcc5b0ee860c3adf0fac5ba6","title":"global markets best quarter in a decade china factories uk economy gdp business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsUK household spending slumped at a record pace in January-March, the ONS adds:Britain’s economy suffered an even more bruising blow from Covid-19 than previously thought.Global stock markets have enjoyed a sizzling quarter, even as the death toll from Covid-19 has marched higher and economies have fallen deep into recession.It means stocks have recovered some, but not all, of the heavy losses suffered during the crash in the first quarter of the year.The financial markets have clearly already priced in a recovery, helped by huge stimulus packages, record low interest rates, and a generous flurry of money-printing by the world’s central banks.Investors are weighing better economic figures against a continued increase in virus cases. Following a stronger-than-forecast U.S. pending home sales figures Monday, China Tuesday reported improving purchasing-manager indexes for both manufacturing and services.“It’s not clear what trajectory coronavirus is heading,” Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said on Bloomberg TV. “But I also think because we’re into quarter-end, there’s been some re-balancing. So I’m kind of in the camp that any weakness is short-lived. I would think July is going to be a strong month for stocks.”Economists and traders are cheered by the news that China’s factories posted growth this month, despite the ongoing pandemic.Iris Pang of ING says today’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs both send a positive signal for the economy. Can it be sustained? Demand for materials and products for the development of advanced technology, the real estate market and infrastructure projects support growing manufacturing activity. The foreign orders PMI at 42.6 in June confirms that external demand remains weak. We believe that the ongoing Covid-19 situation in the US and Europe will keep the pressure on export orders in the coming months. External demand weakness is putting pressure on some manufacturers, especially small factories, of which the sub-index PMI fell to 48.9 in June from 50.8 a month ago. This confirms our view that small manufacturers continue to struggle to get export orders. Here’s Stephen Innes of Axicorp:The better-than-expected China PMI lends further weight to the argument that a global cyclical recovery is well underway.And Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank:Encouragingly, there was a broad improvement in the details for the manufacturing PMI with output, new orders and new export orders all rising from last month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Some upbeat economic news from China is cheering investors on the final day of June, boosting optimism that the world economy is turning the corner.China’s factories grew at a slightly faster pace this month, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics. Its Purchasing Manager’s Index has risen to 50.9 from 50.4 in May (anything over 50 indicates growth).It’s the fourth month of (modest) growth in a row, as China emerged from the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 in January and February.Chinese manufacturers reported that supply and demand are starting to pick up, leading to more new orders. However, new export orders are still down, meaning factories are still shedding jobs.In a statement, NBS official Zhao Qinghe said there was still much uncertainty about the economic outlook, with small Chinese companies finding conditions particularly tough.Services companies also strengthened, with the official non-manufacturing PMI rising to 54.4 in June from 53.6 in May. That’s the best reading of the year.Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, explain:“The latest survey data suggest that economic growth accelerated in June thanks to a faster recovery in manufacturing and services, alongside continued strength in construction activity,The recovery should remain robust in the coming months as strong infrastructure spending offsets external weakness.” Following an unexpected surge in US home sales on Monday, this may bolster hopes that the world economy may be gingerly emerging from the coronavirus slump.European stock markets are expected to rise a little this morning, at the end of one of the strongest quarters in decades.Astonishing, really, given the world is still gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic. Clearly the unprecedented stimulus from central banks has reassured investors, even though a V-shaped recovery looks rather unlikely.And most markets are still deep in the red for the year, due to the crash in February and March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55eb473d49a76b68938309e19f9c694a778ef19d/0_32_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56a422ac4e45b32b3df4c22d5fbadec8","title":"unemployment is no fun at the best of times but its particularly strange during a pandemic","story":"The government website suggested I apply to be a Portuguese-speaking chef or steel fabricator. I’ve been to Portugal! I … know what steel is!One morning recently, my day began like every other: I pulled back the curtains, made a strong cup of coffee, and looked for work. This has been my ritual since March. I logged on to the government Jobactive website and saw the following jobs suggested for me: Portuguese-speaking chef, experienced steel fabricator, and tennis coach.I’ve now been out of work for over three months after my workplace shut down due to restrictions – freelance work, too, has dried up due to budget constraints or publications closing.By now, I’m considering everything. After seeing these jobs, that curious part of my brain wondered if I could bluff my way into any of them. I’ve been to Portugal! I played tennis in high school! And I … know what steel is!A friend suggested a Mrs Doubtfire situation, with me running between jobs and hastily changing outfits. I imagined backhanding Portuguese tarts in a steel factory. Although this did appeal to me, especially as I could work in a Benny Hill-style nudie run at the end, it seemed that the right thing to do was not waste anybody’s time. (Besides, who wants to be around a tennis club when a rogue Novak Djokovic could start a covid conga line at any given moment?)Unemployment is no fun at the best of times, but it’s a particularly strange experience during a pandemic. In April, I searched every job site online to cross-reference, and despite my degrees and work experience in several different industries, only fit the bill for three jobs. I’ve joined Facebook groups for local job listings and witnessed posts less than 30 minutes old have their comments turned off because they received hundreds of messages from applicants.My anxiety has even taken me to the deepest, darkest, most disturbing corner of the internet … LinkedIn. A place where businessmen named Chad smile at me with their unnervingly white teeth and soulless eyes, urging me to buy their eBook titled Sharks Never Sleep: 8 Hacks For Business And Success We Can Learn From Great Whites.As restrictions ease, more jobs are being advertised, but even formerly entry-level gigs like casual hospitality or data entry roles require 3+ years of experience. I’m just one of thousands of applicants constantly rereading cover letters in the same way one would reread a post-date text message ... hoping I don’t sound too desperate.I’m anxious most days, and expect to be I believe this ever-present dread of uncertainty is normal. But what has been surprising is the level to which I’ve internalised the “get back to work, you lazy idiot” subtext I hear during commentary of unemployment. Despite knowing the complexities of unemployment and related issues, and belief that a person’s worth is not dependent on a job, the messaging that ‘self-worth  productivity’ is so bloody powerful that most days I feel worthless.It really shouldn’t have surprised me. I’ve worked in the community with people applying for jobs after a sleepless night at a boarding house. Or people accessing treatment for mental illness or substance use issues only to be labelled a “bludger”. Young people fleeing violence applying for private rentals knowing the real estate agent isn’t going to grant a lease to a teenager on youth allowance. I’ve seen these attitudes and systems destroy hope in people who desperately need support.Today, I am just another person feeling useless and guilty for … what, exactly? Existing in a world where even prior to Covid-19, underemployment and increased casualisation of workplaces were a concern? For benefiting from the coronavirus supplement in an admission that the typical jobseeker rate is not enough to live off? Despite knowing this intellectually, it remains an ongoing challenge to resist feeling like a failure. But I’m not – and neither is anyone who was unemployed prior to March 2020.As numbers increase and related issues arise, I wonder if any good will come from this (it’s still early days for 2020, I know) – strength in numbers could be key. We can hope for more empathy. We can aspire for equity. We can advocate for meaningful, inclusive and long-lasting change.And as for me? Perhaps I’ll look up what a steel fabricator actually does … or maybe I’ll take the afternoon off.• Deirdre Fidge is a writer whose work has appeared on ABC News, SBS, the Sydney Morning Herald, Frankie magazine and television’s Get Krackin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

It’s almost embarrassing now, but I dreamed about influencing the course of pop. I’d been writing songs since I was 13, but after David Bowie’s Station to Station came out, when I was 19, I started to study his methods, likes and dislikes. He didn’t like country and western, so I wrote Faron Young from the worldview of someone who disliked country music.Bonny was written around the same time. People think it’s about my father’s death, but he wasn’t dead then – I imagined grief. Goodbye Lucille #1 started out as a 50s doo-wop parody – “Ooh, Johnny Johnny Johnny” – in waltz time, but turned into something serious. Most breakup songs were sad or accusatory, but I straddled the viewpoints of both the intense guy and the girl breaking up with him (“She’s a person too”).I’d always written on an acoustic guitar, but just as we started making records I had a crisis and thought I’d exhausted the guitar and started writing instead on a Roland synthesiser. I was too eccentric or nervous a songwriter to incorporate a big chorus, but when When Love Breaks Down came along I didn’t fight it. I wrote that, and Appetite – over a hip-hop-type groove on a drum machine – and then Desire As in the same week in June 1984. “I’ve got six things on my mind. You’re no longer one of them” is so cold. I wouldn’t want to say that to anybody. “Desire as a sylph-figured creature who changes her mind.” I’ve no idea where these things come from.I’d used my most off-kilter ideas on our first album, Swoon, and I’d deliberately held back my more commercial songs. The album title – Steve McQueen – came to me in a dream. It doesn’t mean anything, but I decided to use it and we shot the cover using a motorbike like the one McQueen had in The Great Escape.The album went gold and has sold steadily ever since. I’m humbled that it’s become a classic and people still discover it, but I still remember driving away from the studio in the snow thinking we’d get a lot of praise for something I felt I didn’t have much to do with. It was us playing the songs in the studio – Thomas Dolby and the team did a marvellous job of making us sound grand and opulent. When we were doing Johnny Johnny there was this embarrassing clunk, which was the sound of me hitting the microphone stand while singing. Thomas loved the take and wanted to keep it, so he went to the Fairlight sampler, looked at the wave form of the sound and just took out the clunk. I remember thinking, “Wow, so that’s what pop is going to be like in future.”I was on Radio 1’s Roundtable programme reviewing records, and the other guests were raving about all these awful Christmas songs. Then Prefab Sprout’s Don’t Sing came on. I’d never heard anything like it. Paddy’s ideas seemed detached from everything except maybe a mid-20th-century American novel. The next thing I knew their manager invited me up to their old rectory in Consett. Paddy’s bedroom was twice the size of a single mattress. He sat with a guitar and played me songs from sheets of paper. I recorded them all, took them home and whittled 40 down to 12.I played Paddy’s chords on my synthesiser using my own sounds. The Fairlight sampler had just come out so I could make orchestral arrangements. The gunshot on Faron Young came from a BBC sound effects disc played backwards. I did things like sampling Wendy’s voice and “playing” it on a few songs.I’ve never seen a band eat like Prefab. Wendy would say “Paddy, do you want a bacon sandwich?” and they’d all go off for a fry-up. We recorded Horsin’ Around after a pub break. Paddy launched into a swing version à la Frank Sinatra. I laughed my head off, and thought it might make an interesting style for the middle section, so we kept it.• Steve McQueen turned 35 on 22 June.

Two graduates have set up a volunteering initiative, Generation Help, to link new graduates with SMEs, with the hope that once connected a job might arise.There is also a push to build a national youth corps that would guarantee jobs for all young people. In an open letter to the government, a coalition of British youth charities backing the plan said: “Generation covid … face having their lives altered as no other generation since the war, with scars that will last their entire lives.”John Craven, the chief executive of upReach, said: “We created our programme at record speed to tackle the dearth of opportunities brought about by covid. We have offered the chance to apply to over 1,000 young people and had hundreds of applications already.”UpReach’s four-week programmes are delivered by volunteers from employers including Allen \u0026amp Overy, the civil service fast stream, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Slaughter and May, as well as team members from upReach itself.“Employers are aware that if they are seen to be cutting jobs they have offered for this autumn then the reputational damage could be quite significant, but it doesn’t mean they have to carry on recruiting at those same levels in the future,” said Martin Birchall, the founder of High Fliers Research.Gwenan Jones, 23, is about to graduate from the University of Durham with a degree in modern languages. “I’m so worried about the future that I can’t even think about it. There’s just no point is there? Each day I read about the damage to the UK economy that this pandemic is causing, how more and more people are being made redundant,” she said.Rachel Deakin, 22, is about to finish her PGCE at the University of Bristol. “I have been explicitly rejected from three jobs during lockdown because I’m too much of a risk, having had my placement cut short by lockdown, by fve weeks. Having specifically trained for this role and accrued another year’s worth of debt, this was heartbreaking to hear.”Zoe, 22, is about to graduate from a PGCE. She had planned to become an art teacher. “My future and the future of university students becomes more dark each passing day,” she said. “I am terrified to finish university even though I know what I want to do.“I am not hopeful that there will be enough job opportunities out there for us. Overall I have great fear and anxiety over my dream profession. I also have anxiety and fear of being made redundant from my part-time job at a supermarket because a job that was meant to keep me going through university is now the only way I have to make money for the foreseeable future.”Matthew Thomson, 24, is studying architecture at the University of Dundee. “The uncertainty appears to have dried up almost every prospect of finding employment. To get to the end of an unbelievably stressful year and see very few options is very disheartening.”Mia Stubbings, 25, is in her third year at Lamda, studying stage management. “I don’t currently have an industry to graduate into,” she said. “All my plans for my future have been taken away from me and now I’m left with a gaping hole.“It’s unlikely I’ll get a job in theatre until next year at least and even then the competition will be fierce. I’ve spent three years working immensely hard and and now I need to change my dreams and plans so I can pay my rent.”Charys Newton, 23, will graduate in September from a master’s in music industries from the University of Glasgow. “The live music industry has been completely shuttered by the pandemic and is not expected to open up again until summer next year at the earliest,” she said. “This means that by the time the live music industries are hiring again, my degree will be nearly a year out of date, and many promoters and venues will have gone out of business. My prospects of getting a job in this area are super slim.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c44b13dadf80262817dd8f0966f60dfc27b5490/0_276_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=a4bad6302ff818945fff05413b1e783d","title":"earths final frontier the global race to map the entire ocean floor","story":"An ambitious project to chart the seabed by 2030 could help countries prepare for tsunamis, protect marine habitats and monitor deep-sea mining. But the challenge is unprecedentedOn a wall facing Vicki Ferrini’s desk hangs a giant map of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. At 6ft by 8ft, it’s the largest size available on the printer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where she works as a geoinformatics researcher. “I of course want it even bigger,” she says.The map is busier than a usual world map. Rather than showing featureless, flat blue ocean, here the seafloor bursts with detail: mountains, canyons, channels and plains that resemble the texture of land. Ferrini encourages her staff to print pictures of the seafloor features they’re researching and tack them to the map. One example off the coast of Argentina shows ripples in the seafloor reaching a hundred metres high. The map has a distinctly Sherlock Holmes-about-to-break-a-big-case look to it. “I’m trying to see the scale of the ocean,” she explains. “The big picture – but also the fine details.”Mapping requires an ability to see the forest as well as the trees – or in this case, the coral as well as the sea. It’s a particular challenge when it comes to the ocean, the vast majority of which is not just unmapped, but unknown. Ferrini’s map is humanity’s best effort to date: a crucial document in what has become a race to map the entire seafloor by the end of the decade.The stakes are high. A series of reports have warned of the ocean’s impending collapse. The First World Ocean Assessment, published by the UN Environment Programme in 2015, revealed that the ocean’s very ability to function was in jeopardy. The following year, an OECD report estimated that the ocean economy employed 31 million people full-time and generated $1.5 trillion each year. Maps – or the lack thereof – play a role in nearly every critical ocean issue, from sea level rise to ocean acidification to bioersity.It’s often said that humanity knows more about the surface of the moon than we do the seafloor. It seems astounding that faraway planets can be more accessible than our own. But we tend to skip over why it is so difficult to map the seafloor: there is a massive obstacle in the way called the ocean. Light travels far and fast in space, but the laser altimeters that we use to chart celestial bodies are ineffective in water – the lasers are simply absorbed.Sound, on the other hand, travels more efficiently underwater than it does in air. The gold standard for seafloor mapping today is a multi-beam echosounder, which can be attached directly on to the hull of a ship. The device sends down a fan of sound waves, which computers decipher into a three-dimensional portrait of the seafloor’s shape and composition. Additional techniques also collect water temperature and salinity along the way.It is slow work. Ferrini recently sent another version of the map, this one blacking out all the uncharted ocean today. The coastlines were lit up with data. So, too, were well-traversed shipping lanes. The rest sat in darkness, except for a few pinpricks of light.Few countries need accurate maps of the seabed more than Japan, an island nation whose future is uniquely intertwined with the ocean’s, and it is the Nippon Foundation , a Japanese non-profit organisation run on the gambling proceeds of motorboat racing, that is backing Seabed 2030 with $2m every year. In the past, the foundation has addressed thorny global challenges such as eliminating leprosy or fighting food insecurity, and a complete seafloor map fits within its mandate, as well as Japan’s wider national interests. Seabed 2030 would improve Japan’s fisheries management and its tsunami and typhoon preparation, as well as clarify territorial claims in the South China Sea.But the mapping is a truly global collaboration, public and free to use, ided among four regional centres. The Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany took the Southern Ocean Stockholm University and the University of New Hampshire cover the North Pacific and Arctic New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research are responsible for the South and West Pacific Ocean. That leaves the largest swath, the entire Atlantic and Indian Oceans, to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University – Ferrini’s team.The finished map itself is created by a fifth centre, based in the UK: the British Oceanographic Data Centre in Southampton. It collects the analysed data from the four centres and compiles it in the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (Gebco). The data is in the public domain, free to use, adapt and commercially exploit.It is making remarkable new discoveries all the time. Off Florida, a reef of mid-ocean corals turned up in the Gulf of Mexico, a shipwreck. A forthcoming study on ice sheets will use Gebco to unpack how the ocean influences melting and raises sea levels. Where Gebco could be used in deep-sea mining, however, would be to help the ISA to better regulate the industry, he says – something of a double-edged sword, depending on your point of view.Another potential controversy is whether mapping introduces more noise to an already noisy ocean. Air guns, naval sonar and shipping traffic are increasingly edging out marine mammals that rely on sound to hunt, navigate and communicate. New research from graduate student Hilary Kates Varghese at the University of New Hampshire revealed that the multi-beam echosounders used by Seabed 2030 did not disrupt the feeding behaviour of Cuvier’s beaked whale, one of the more sonically sensitive marine mammals. However, research biologist Annamaria DeAngelis at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out that because Seabed 2030 is mapping the entire ocean, “more studies will be needed to expand our knowledge of how their particular echosounders will affect marine mammals in a variety of habitats.”One way to reduce noise is to crowdsource from ships that are already charting the ocean. When the multimillionaire Victor Vescovo went on a mission to reach the deepest point of all five oceans, Seabed 2030 mappers collected soundings along the journey. Other industry partners are donating whatever data they can. Crowdsourcing is crucial – from cruise ships, hydrographic offices, even weekend boaters with a decent sounder. By itself, a single ship would need 200 years to map the rest of the uncharted seas.However, “sharing data is a little taboo”, says Tinah Voahangy Martin, a member of Ferrini’s staff who often approaches institutions located on the Indian Ocean to ask for seafloor information. Seafloor data is often considered proprietary, classified or simply too valuable to give away. “You don’t want to be the person who comes in and says ‘Hi, you do this and we expect this.’ You take them on as a partner. That’s the best way to get them involved.”Ferrini adds that, because science in the US is often taxpayer-funded, it creates the expectation that data will always be freely available. “We have to remind ourselves that the whole world doesn’t work that way, and figure out how we can make it mutually beneficial.”Nevertheless, at their rate of progress, the finish line of 2030 seems possible. But completing the map on Ferrini’s wall is just the beginning. “There’s still so much more for us to do and know than the shape of the seafloor,” she says. “This is just one piece of a much bigger picture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75a1e1bb8b5788ebc719d1459d02bd5da037c4c9/0_0_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143eaf5aa611e563eb3976eea0b4caed","title":"rachel roddys eight rules of pasta plus favourite sauce recipes","story":"How much water and salt to use? Drain the pasta well or leave it dripping? It depends on whether you’re making this double tomato sauce or this courgette-almond pesto A few days after we bought our cooker, a book arrived in the post. The cooker was a secondhand Gasfire Cucina – identified by the man who came to service and fit it (a 40-minute job that cost twice the price of the cooker) as one of the last to be made entirely by hand before the factory was mechanised in the late 1960s. The book was In The Kitchen With Love, Sophia Loren’s first cookbook a surprise gift from a woman called Cathy Whims, whom I’d met at a lunch.A cooker and a cookbook: the two were already related. They were also both beautiful, singleminded, previously owned, smelled vaguely of well-done toast, and both special (one handmade, the other first-edition). Add to all that the proximity of their arrival and the fact that the book was first published the year I was born. Also, that Sophia, too, had a Gasfire cooker, larger than mine, with hub-cap-like vents and two ovens, and that features in three of the book’s eight colour plates so saturated with colour and flair, they seem to glow and throb. It is my habit to look for messages – in clouds, coincidences, song lyrics, the condensation on train windows – a habit that verges on superstition at times. But there was no doubting that there was significance in it all, and that Sophia, her chin resting in her hand, her elbow resting on a table heaped with vegetables and dry spaghetti threatening to slide off, was glowing and speaking directly to me.“Here are the rules that I want to suggest to you,” she writes at the start of the pastascuitta section in her book, some of which I don’t agree with – so I share my own pasta rules with you here.1 You need a large pot with plenty of water, so that each sprig of pasta can cook separately, free to move in the water without clustering. I never imagined I would be so dedicated to pasta, but I am, and putting on the water for it marks the middle or end of our every day. I have a lightweight pan that holds six litres, but as I am usually cooking 400g dried pasta, I fill it with four litres (one litre for every 100g pasta).2 Add salt (10g for every litre) when the water is boiling – this will increase the violence of the boiling.3 Turn the flame even higher to compensate for the fall in temperature when you add the pasta.4 As you add the pasta, stir to spread it out.5 Keep a careful eye and pay more attention to tasting than to the manufacturer’s timings taste and taste – it should be firm, but not raw.6 This is where is Sophia and I disagree – disagreement being a fundamental tenet of home cooking. She suggests adding oil to the cooking water to make the pasta more “mobile” when adding sauce I keep back the starchy pasta cooking water, which I then add back to the dish if it needs loosening.7 Careful draining. Again, I disagree with Sophia here, because it depends on the dish. For some pastas, dripping like Colin Firth as Mr Darcy emerging from a pond can be a bonus. Courgette pesto, for example, a vivid green, pounded sauce that owes everything to classic basil, pine nut, garlic, olive oil and pecorino, but replaces some of the basil with grated courgette and some of the (fiendishly expensive) pine nuts with almonds. Pasta dripping with starchy cooking water (helped by the addition of a diced potato) is required for the dish to have a soft swish, and to curl it around a fork. When it comes to double tomato sauce, on the other hand – a Puglian recipe via Emiko Davies, in which the pasta is layered with an olive-oil-rich cooked tomato sauce and a raw one also gratings of salty cheese – well-drained pasta is key.As is 8: waste no time in mixing the pasta and the sauce and bringing it to the table, steaming hot. Use the rest of the pasta cooking water to do the washing up – and to wipe the red or green splatters from the cooker, but not the book.400g pasta – I used linguine, but trofie or penne would also work2 small, firm courgettes40g almonds or a mix of almonds and pine nuts1 garlic cloveSalt1 big handful basil leaves100ml olive oil50g pecorino or parmesan, or a mix, gratedA small potato, peeled and dicedBring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta.Wash, top and tail the courgettes, then, using the coarse side of a box grater, grate into a clean tea towel and squeeze all the excess water out.In a blender or mortar, blitz or pound the nuts, garlic and a pinch of salt until the mix resembles a coarse rubble. Add the courgette, basil and oil, and blitz or pound again, until you have a rough, vivid-green paste. Scrape into a large bowl, stir in the cheese and taste for salt.Salt the boiling water and cook the pasta, adding the diced potato, too, until the pasta is cooked but still has some bite.Drain the pasta (saving some of the cooking water) and combine with the pesto. Swirl it around, and add more pasta cooking water to achieve a soft, swishy texture.

Pull from the heat.For the raw sauce, quarter (or eighth, if they are big) the fresh tomatoes over a bowl to catch the juices, add a good pinch of salt, four tablespoons of olive oil and lots of ripped basil, and leave to sit while you cook the pasta.Bring the pan of water back to a boil, add salt, stir, then add the pasta, cook until al dente, then drain.Spread a little cooked sauce in the base of a shallow bowl, add a layer of hot pasta, then some uncooked sauce, a grating of ricotta … Continue layering like this until all the ingredients are mixed, ending with cheese and some basil leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef1f4f04685a2ea5395d3826d031e1b2003b69ef/0_76_1945_1167/master/1945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=addb48ee389b64106362d169fc4344a5","title":"crystal palace burnley premier league match report","story":"Somehow, ridiculously, the Burnley bus trundles on, however many wheels keep falling off it. It has been a turbulent week for them: one that began with a chastening 5-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium, and has taken in an injury crisis, a brewing storm between manager Sean Dyche and chairman Mike Garlick over expiring contracts and transfer investment, and a pitched battle against the racist elements of their own fanbase.And yet, at the end of it, they sit eighth in the Premier League: level on points with Tottenham, within touching distance of European football. Captain Ben Mee’s header just after the hour was enough to seal all three points for them against a poor Crystal Palace. Afterwards, Dyche described it as one of the biggest results of his Burnley career. Truly, this is a club continuing to defy not just gravity, not just sporting economics, but occasionally even simple logic.It is, perhaps, a testament to the sound fundamentals of the club, however uncertain the future, however frail the squad. Dyche deserves plenty of credit for again devising an exemplary gameplan designed to neuter Palace’s multiple attacking threats. The returning Wilfried Zaha was double-teamed out of the game by Phil Bardsley and Josh Brownhill the prolific Jordan Ayew was largely ineffective, and probably lucky to escape a red card for a forearm smash on Brownhill in the second half.No tale of Burnley heroism, however, is complete without a nod to the team themselves, many of them playing their third game in a week. As Palace threw wave after wave at them in the closing minutes, it was Burnley’s thirst for the grapple, the desperate deflection, the must-win header, the anatomy-threatening block, that again proved to be the difference. James Tarkowski was probably the standout, but in truth they all played their part: 34 clearances, 21 blocks, the legacy of a footballing brick wall that has allowed this modest-sized club to punch well above their threadbare resources.An ankle injury to Jack Cork will stretch them even further. Here again, Dyche was able to fill only five of his eight outfield substitute berths. Injury to Jay Rodriguez left Matej Vydra leading the line as the only fit senior forward, and from the off Burnley’s approach revolved around hitting him early, and then using their tireless midfield runners – particularly the slippery Dwight McNeil at No 10 – to forage on the second balls.McNeil looked the likeliest player on either side to create something. Quick, eager to roam and always showing for the ball, McNeil is the sort of one-man creative hub you so rarely see at the bigger clubs these days, with their all-star casts, their strictly delineated roles, their endlessly rotated squads. Most of what Burnley did well seemed to go through him, and without the ball too he was a constant menace.It was McNeil’s mesmerising run that provided the first half’s only real moment of grace: weaving past Luka Milivojevic, striding half the length of the field, and let down only by a weak shot. James McArthur was probably Palace’s best player, linking well with Zaha, probing Burnley’s back line for fissures. But overall the impression was of two teams pushing themselves through the pain barrier, and determined to put everyone else through a similar experience. After an inert first half, Palace were just beginning to take a grip on the game. That was when Burnley hit them.A petty foul in a game full of them, this time on McNeil by James McCarthy, who had replaced Cheikhou Kouyaté at half-time, offered an opening. From the resulting free-kick, Mee ed in ahead of Gary Cahill and erted the ball brilliantly past Vicente Guaita at the near post: a header with the control and guile of a Van Basten volley. Perhaps Guaita might have done a little better with it. But now Burnley, whose record defending leads has been exemplary this season, had a golden chance to lock down the game and the three points.As Dyche added extra defensive muscle in the shape of Kevin Long, Roy Hodgson rang the changes in attack. Andros Townsend was withdrawn for Max Meyer, seconds after putting one of his trademark left-foot scunners into the stand, and the hitherto ineffective Zaha was moved into the centre. Chances came, too: Milivojevic put a simple header over the bar, Ayew failed to bring the ball down six yards out. But stoutly and saltily, Burnley held firm. Sunday’s game against Sheffield United now has the feel of an unlikely Europa League play-off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42148bba4523b7f595688facfbe04b6687113dd5/0_120_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa1af354a93adffd758cb724a593c03","title":"exeter city northampton town league two playoff final match report","story":"Perhaps the most brutal thing for Exeter City’s players, even more than the battering to which they had just been subjected, was that they could hear the victors’ every whoop and yelp. Northampton would have loved to celebrate their return to League One in front of their supporters, rather than 1,500 cardboard imitations, but their joy at the end was unconfined the songs of triumph rang out into the night and it is unlikely a losing team has ever left the Wembley pitch with comparable haste.The most telling injury had already been inflicted. “We started as men but quickly turned into boys,” the Exeter manager, Matt Taylor, admitted, and a summary could perfectly well end there. This was, from the moment Ryan Watson put Northampton ahead in the 11th minute, simply no contest. Name an attribute required to win a football match, and Keith Curle’s side offered more of it: anyone could point to their physical power and the relentlessness with which they peppered their opponents’ box, but they outdid Exeter for speed, clarity of thought, invention and sheer workrate too. It all made for a record margin of victory in a fourth-tier play-off final, and one that had only been achieved once previously across the isions.“The way we play, we ask questions,” said Curle. “We create goalscoring opportunities when things go right, and we’ve got numbers in the box, we know we’ve got players who can score goals.”By half-time, the only surprise was that they did not have more than two. The opening exchanges had hinted at ding-dong play-off fare but then Charlie Goode, the Northampton captain, hurled his second booming throw-in towards the Exeter six-yard box and the capitulation began. In fairness this was one delivery they half-cleared, but only as far as Watson just beyond the 18-yard line. The shimmy that manoeuvred the ball on to his left foot was neat and the resulting low drive on target, even if it took a deflection on its way past Jonathan Maxted.The referee, Michael Salisbury, might as well have called time at that point. Northampton bullied Exeter for the remainder but that should not be taken as a pejorative description. They wreaked chaos every time the ball went near the area, Vadaine Oliver proving a towering menace at centre-forward and his partner, Callum Morton, winning seemingly lost causes with regularity.The second goal came just after Nicky Adams, their influential winger, had departed through injury. No problem: a free-kick was duly aimed into Exeter territory, headed on by Scott Wharton and helped on by Jordan Turnbull. Morton, on loan from West Brom, applied the finish and Northampton would have scored four more times before the interval if Maxted had not repelled a bombardment of headers.When Dean Moxey tried matching their aggression shortly before the hour the outcome was an embarrassment for the experienced Exeter defender. His tackle, thundering in recklessly as Watson sized up a pass in midfield, was vicious and impossible to excuse. It was the simplest of straight red cards for Salisbury to brandish and Exeter’s third defeat on this stage across the last four seasons was made all the more chastening.That was not even the end of it. The excellent Morton was involved in the move that saw Mark Marshall tee up Sam Hoskins for the third. Andy Williams, the substitute, then scored with his first touch after another long throw it was an apt way to crown the occasion and confirm a long-awaited milestone for Curle, who took this job in October 2018. “I needed a promotion and everybody knew that I don’t shy away from it,” he said. Northampton provided it with as forthcoming a display as he could have wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925dad9029ab4f5f4086c28951fdd826ac0de87a/0_335_3203_1922/master/3203.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=94e383c923ae4b5ed7f9b0f67516dc9a","title":"from promotions to gift cards how a great website keeps customers coming back again and again","story":"Customer loyalty is something companies crave, but how do they make it happen? Smartphone shopping, augmented-reality changing rooms, same-day delivery (perhaps soon by drone) – with so much innovative e-commerce out there, you would think that small and micro businesses were tooled to the hilt with technology. In reality, nearly half of UK small businesses lack even the most basic of 21st-century gizmos: a website.In recent months, consumer spending has dropped significantly because of Covid-19, but where money is being spent, it is likely to be through online purchases, so a website is more essential than ever if a business is to thrive. In fact, a survey for the website builder GoDaddy found that lockdown has prompted a fifth of micro businesses to set up an online presence for the first time, while nearly half of such businesses have boosted their digital and social media activity.Some savvy small businesses are tapping into this trend by using their websites to create additional opportunities for consumers to spend. Online promotions, reward schemes and e-gift cards are just some of the ways businesses can help keep customers returning.Promotions (vouchers, discounts and deals) are a great way to attract new customers and keep them coming back for more, as are contests, giveaways and flash sales. Meanwhile, free deliveries and automatic replenishment of perishables using a subscription model have become increasingly popular in the e-commerce world. Placing time limits on deals can create a sense of urgency and encourage uptake.Another way to spur bigger purchases is to create product or service bundles, or to cross-sell complementary items. Multi-buy deals – such as three for two – can result in a larger shopping basket too. And what about the customer who leaves your website without purchasing the items in their cart? A reminder email might entice them back.But be warned about heavy discounting, if it’s not done properly, businesses can end up reducing the perceived value of their products or services.Ultimately, it’s crucial to benchmark the results of any promotion against your regular pricing to see which strategy has the most positive impact on the top line.For small businesses, the prospect of running promotions can seem daunting, but it doesn’t need to be if you know where to look. GoDaddy has created a suite of email marketing tools specifically designed with small businesses in mind. These tools let clients quickly and easily send out notifications about promotions, and even automate them to lighten the load.And to help you get to know your customers better – who they are and what resonates with them – GoDaddy makes it simple for its clients to create surveys and monitor the results. All of which will help you run your business in a way that bolsters your bottom line.Reward schemes differ from online promotions in that they encourage repeat purchases over an extended period.The added benefit is that your business can gather data on consumer behaviour and satisfaction, so you can tailor products or services to their needs. Your customers may also spread the word about your loyalty scheme and encourage others to join.For customers, there are many benefits – saving money and time, winning prizes, and early access to products, services or events. Communicating the advantages of a scheme is one of the keys to its success.Typically, customers earn “points” when they buy from you, refer friends or post about your business on social media. You can also award points for anniversaries and business milestones.Shoppers can be automatically enrolled when they make their first purchase, or can opt in via your app, website or social media channels. Customers then redeem their points to get products free or at a discount.Remember to take time periodically reviewing the performance of the programme. You can choose which metrics you measure – whether it’s number of members, or rewards earned or claimed – but it’s important to understand what worked well, what didn’t, and how to improve the programme.Digital gift cards could be the ultimate guarantor of customer loyalty during the pandemic. They’re not just a source of immediate income, they are an endorsement of your business from the giver and a warranty that you’ll gain a future customer. What’s more, they are a relatively cheap marketing tool that spreads awareness of your brand.Some businesses combine e-gift cards with promotions offering future discounts, which they hope will encourage recipients of e-gift cards to return and spend more.This makes sense as the cost of acquiring new customers can be far higher than retaining existing customers. And those existing customers are much more likely to try out new products and to spend more as their trust grows. This underscores the importance of a loyalty scheme for small businesses.Developments in technology might be moving at a rate of knots, but small businesses needn’t be left behind. Beyond the bells and whistles of drones and augmented reality, there is a world of opportunity for entrepreneurs. And it all begins with a website.GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at\u0026nbspOpenWeStand.org\u0026nbspto help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge.

You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

They include statements from dozens of rape victims whose cases were not prosecuted and an account by a CPS whistleblower.Reported rapes have increased steadily over the past decade and more than 58,000 were recorded by police in England and Wales in 201819. However, charges, prosecutions and convictions for rape in cases brought by the CPS have fallen to their lowest levels in more than a decade. The decline is a key area of inquiry in the review.The previously unpublished evidence and detailed legal arguments, shared exclusively with the , have been compiled by End Violence Against Women (EVAW), a coalition of women’s groups, and passed to justice secretary Robert Buckland, chair of the Criminal Justice Board that established the review.In an unusual move, EVAW will publish the documents ahead of a fresh legal challenge against the CPS. The group will mount an appeal over whether the prosecution service adopted a secret policy in rape investigations to drop supposedly “weak” cases in order to boost conviction rates. Whistleblower testimony, which is included in the documents published today, details how CPS prosecutors were allegedly given guidance at training workshops on how to meet conviction targets with “the removal of hundreds of ‘weak’ cases from the criminal justice system which are less likely to find favour with a jury”. The whistleblower claimed the guidance had led to a risk-averse approach to the prosecution of rape, where myths and stereotypes could lead prosecutors to drop cases.The dossier of rape cases where the CPS reportedly declined to bring charges includes one case where the CPS gave the fact that the survivor had “enjoyed an adventurous sex life” as a reason not to charge.Earlier this year, the high court denied the EVAW coalition permission to pursue their case to go to a full hearing. The court of appeal has now agreed to hear an appeal against that decision.A recent report by the Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate concluded the service was not to blame for a precipitous drop in rape charges, but that the system – and in particular police-led investigations – was under-resourced to “breaking point”.This is disputed by a coalition of women’s rights groups who launched a legal challenge against the CPS in September 2019.Rape is a notoriously difficult crime to prosecute primarily because it comes down to the question of consent, often in a situation where there are only two people. In these cases evidence beyond the word of the victim or defendant is seen as central to building a strong case. Digital evidence requested from complainants, such as data, location information and texts from phones, is time-consuming to investigate. In 2018, more than half of all rape cases took more than 100 days to assign an outcome.A charge or summons is one of the steps in proceeding to a trial. Even if a suspect is charged a case may be dropped and if it proceeds to court a conviction is less likely than it was a decade ago.Caelainn Barr and Alexandra ToppingEVAW alleges that the “merits-based” approach of pursuing all cases where there is credible evidence has been replaced by a “bookmaker’s test” approach where they guess the probability of a jury convicting on the evidence and become reluctant to press ahead with more difficult rape cases.In the hearing this March, counsel for the CPS denied that there had been a change in policy, stating that: “The fall of conviction rates is due to a far wider range of factors involving the police that are now the subject of a government review.”There has been a “precipitous drop” in prosecution rates for rape, falling to their lowest level in a decade despite a sharp increase in the number of cases being reported to police.A review of the latest CPS charging statistics included in the evidence submitted show only one in three rape cases resulted in a charge between April and September 2018.Others, including a controversial report from Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI), have blamed the steep decline on lack of police and CPS resources due to austerity cuts as well as the massive increase in workload involved in most cases due to the availability of digital downloads from complainants’ and defendants’ mobile phones.The collapse of a series of rape cases in 2017 also raised concerns about whether sufficient effort was being put into disclosure of crucial evidence – further adding to the burdens on officers and prosecutors.The documents released online on Tuesday are part of the claim submitted to the court in March. Because that hearing was halted at the preliminary, permission stage much of it has not been widely publicised.Sue Hemming, CPS director of legal services, said: “We share the concerns about the gap between reported rapes and those cases which come to court. However, the judgment of the High Court was clear: there has been no change of approach in how CPS prosecutes rape. They found that there was no arguable basis for EVAW’s claims.“We are focused on understanding the charging gap and will shortly announce further plans to help secure justice for everybody affected by sexual violence.”EVAW has previously been highly successful in challenging legal decisions, notably over the police’s failure to carry out effective investigations into victims of the serial sex attacker John Worboys.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said it has committed to publishing an action plan in relation to the end-to-end review this year and it will respond to the letter in due course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4a570507d740725099cf3d230eceed17358647/0_100_2941_1765/master/2941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d00cfbf0ae35bd13ea1fe69aca2592","title":"how we met he was wearing a horrible old jacket and mistook me for someone else","story":"Bruce James, 61, and Julia Piedra Gutierrez, 57, met in 1998 in Costa Rica, when he mistook her for a girl he had met at a party. They now live in Honolulu, but are currently separated by the coronavirus pandemicAfter 10 years working as a merchant seaman in the US, Bruce James left his job in 1997 to move to San Jose, Costa Rica. He held a party the year after in October to celebrate his newfound freedom. “I met a beautiful Dutch woman called Julia,” he says. “I had a girlfriend at the time, but she stood out.” Several weeks later, he and his girlfriend attended a concert. “I spotted the girl from the party again, so I went over to say hello.” He soon found out it was a case of mistaken identity.Julia Piedra Gutierrez, who was from Costa Rica, was waiting for her date and had no idea who Bruce was. “I saw this American guy looking at me. He was wearing this horrible old leather jacket,” she laughs. “He called me by my name and I had to explain that he was mistaken. Then his girlfriend came over and also thought I was the Dutch Julia.” They laughed about the misunderstanding. “I was a single mum with a busy career, and I’d planned my first date in ages. When my date turned up, he brought his wife. Apparently, they were separating, but still friends. It was an absolute nightmare.” She admits she wishes she could have spent the night with the “badly dressed” American instead.In December that year, Julia and Bruce bumped into each other again. “We were in this smoky bar, and I went up to him to say hello,” she says. He didn’t recognise her at first. “I gave her the most horrible look. I think I’d had one too many beers.” Incensed by the idea that he thought she was flirting with him, Julia angrily explained who she was. “He realised and jumped up with such surprise that he accidentally pushed me over.” They spent the rest of the evening talking and laughing.Julia was impressed that he had driven all the way to her mountain home to pick her up. “None of my dates had ever done that before. He turned up in this old, noisy car, though, and I thought: ‘What the heck is that?’” But his old-fashioned charm worked. “He wasn’t like the usual men I went out with. But my friends kept telling me to give him a chance, and I found myself falling for him.”After several months of dating, Julia was shocked to find she was pregnant. Bruce moved into her home in San Jose so they could give their relationship a real chance. “There was a big learning curve when I became a stepdad to her teenage son,” says Bruce. Despite the challenges, the couple grew stronger. They married in July 1999 and their daughter was born in February 2000. In November 2002, they welcomed another son to the family.“We set up a business together building houses to sell, but it was hit by the financial crisis,” says Bruce. In 2009, he found a job towing oil barges in Honolulu, and they moved to Hawaii. “We didn’t want to stay for ever,” adds Julia, “so I started a women’s shoes business in Costa Rica so that we could retire there.” She is currently based there because of the lockdown, but plans to return to Honolulu in July. “I miss them, but I am so proud of how they are taking care of each other,” she says.Bruce adores his wife’s energy and her ability to make him laugh. “She always has a funny story to tell, and I love listening to her. I feel as if I won the lottery.” Although Julia never planned to marry again or have more children, it’s the best decision she ever made. “He is so calming and always sees the bigger picture. We’ve had so much fun, and I believe we are just better human beings together.”Want to share your story?

But Paul Carroll knew better. The 59-year-old police trainer had seen the saucer-eyed teenage girls and lads swigging from cans of beer flooding into Daisy Nook country park, in Greater Manchester, as he took his dogs for a walk that evening. Carroll stared at the revellers in astonishment. Illegal raves simply do not happen in Daisy Nook.It was not a restful evening. The traffic outside Carroll’s house was relentless, as was the whoosh of the nitrous oxide balloons the young people were huffing as they marched through the country park to the rave site, an empty field accessible from a canal path. Just after midnight, Carroll found a group of young men urinating on his garden wall. Insults were exchanged. “I wasn’t scared,” Carroll says. “I would have given as good as I’d got!” He backtracks. “Well, there were seven of them and I hadn’t got any shoes on.” After that encounter, Carroll’s wife told him to stop going outside. But he couldn’t sleep, so Carroll sat and watching the road, enraged. More cars. More balloons. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.About 4,000 people raved in Daisy Nook that night. Meanwhile, another 2,000 people attended a “quarantine rave” in Carrington, 15 miles away. Similar raves have popped up throughout June. Staffordshire: 1,000 people raved in Brookhay Woods, near Lichfield. Liverpool: hundreds of revellers danced to house music in a forest near Kirkby. Bristol: 1,000 people gathered in Stokes Croft. Leeds: police shut down a rave in an underpass of the M1 motorway as shocked motorists watched participants flood on to the road one clubber Vogued his way down the hard shoulder. Manchester: hundreds gathered in a courtyard in Moss Side. The DJ kept shouting: “Welcome to Manchester.”Across the country, young people are ignoring lockdown, strapping on bumbags and making for woods and fields. With the coronavirus pandemic having closed bars and clubs and cancelled or postponed festivals, raves are sweeping the UK, just as they did during the “second summer of love” in 1988, when acid house swept the country and ecstasy and bucket hats were everywhere.But some of those who were around for the summer of rave in 1988 say the comparison ends there. Those raves were “about everyone coming together”, says Alon Shulman, the author of The Second Summer of Love: How Dance Music Took Over the World. “If we’re putting vulnerable people at risk due to coronavirus, that’s not in the spirit of the summer of love.” Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester’s night-time economy adviser – and the owner of the club The Warehouse Project – quickly condemned the ravers in Carrington and Daisy Nook. “You aren’t clubbers, just selfish idiots,” he tweeted.Hanging over these parties are the fears that such mass gatherings could lead to a second wave of coronavirus infections. “The idea that: ‘Yay, this is over, let’s celebrate,’ is very premature,” says Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds. “The prevalence of coronavirus is not nearly down far enough. This has not gone away yet.” Griffin points to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics that show that the decline in new Covid-19 cases has levelled off he says this, plus the absence of an established testing system, is deeply concerning.“Raves are a bad idea, even if they are outdoors,” Griffin says. “It’s a myth to say you can’t spread coronavirus in the open air. You’re exerting yourself, meaning that you have a higher respiration rate you’re in close proximity and you may have been taking drugs or drinking alcohol, meaning your awareness of physical distancing will be reduced.”The artist Jeremy Deller, whose rave documentary Everybody in the Place showcased the explosion of acid house, is more sanguine. “I think young people always want to be involved in illegal activity,” he says. “It’s a rite of passage.” However, he suggests that young ravers take a leaf out of the electronic music duo Altern-8’s book they wore chemical warfare suits and gas masks to DJ. “Thirty years ahead of their time,” Deller jokes.With the stakes so high, history may not be kind to these young ravers. “Perhaps, in 20 years’ time, people will turn around and say: ‘I went to a rave during the coronavirus pandemic,’ says Shulman. “Some people will say: ‘Amazing!’ and others will say: ‘You idiot. You’re the reason it went on for another six months.’”Finding these parties is simple: Instagram pages with names such as “Secret Forest Rave” or “Secret Quarantine Rave” link to Snapchat accounts, where locations are shared an hour before the event. Other raves are organised via WhatsApp groups. What is more difficult is getting illegal ravers to talk to me. Ravers who break the omertà can be blacklisted from future events – a risk many don’t want to take when they are facing a summer of cancelled plans. So, young people who hours before posted videos to their social media accounts of themselves dancing in a packed field tell me that I have the wrong person, or feign ignorance. “Jog on,” writes one. “Leg it, ya grass,” says another.Illegal raves are popping up faster than velvety mammals in a game of whack-a-mole. “Every time I look at Instagram I see another 10 raves being organised,” says Matty. “It’s going to get so much worse.” Supt Jonathan Davies of Merseyside police, which disrupted the Kirkby rave, says his force has attended four raves this month alone. “They are cropping up very fast,” he says. “It’s a national issue. All the forces are flagging them up. They are gathering momentum.”Young people were obeying the lockdown rules – until suddenly they were not. “The raves started to boom about a month after lockdown, once most people realised they weren’t going to get sick,” says Matty. Penny, a 27-year-old performer from London, recently went to an illegal rave in Hackney, east London. “A month ago, people would have said: ‘No you can’t go partying, that’s awful!’ But the way it’s been handled by the government, now we have a different perspective. They’ve given us such mixed messages all the way through … Boris Johnson wanted herd immunity, didn’t he? He’s achieved that, by being so wishy-washy about the whole thing.”The rave Penny attended was held in some artists’ studios she spent the evening banging a drum she found on the dancefloor and doing tarot readings for guests. “There was a postapocalyptic, glamorous vibe,” she says. “I really enjoyed it. Everyone was in the moment, dancing.”Davies says that some commercialised illegal raves – at which you have to pay for entry – have links to organised crime. “This looks like a group of people involved in criminality who’ve decided to start doing raves, charging £10 a head, and they are relentless. The same people are planning further events.” Greater Manchester police have issued a similar warning, stating that several of the 13 illegal raves they have stopped in recent weeks had links to organised crime, specifically the gangs that control the drug supply to the north-west of England.But enthusiastic amateurs are also getting in on the act. “I’m not a criminal or nothing,” insists Andy when I call him. “I didn’t think it would be as big as it was. It just snowballed.” Andy, who is in his early 20s and lives in Yorkshire, recently organised a rave for 400 people in some woods near Manchester (doing it closer to home seemed too risky). “It was banging,” he says. “I think everyone was just chuffed to be out the house. Everyone was off their heads, like, obviously.”These young ravers are unrepentant about breaking lockdown. “No one is physical distancing,” says Penny. “There’s a sense of nihilism now, like: whatever will be, will be.” Penny sees people in shops and in parks none of them are physically distancing, so why should she? Andy says the same was true at his rave. “Everyone was sweating and dancing together,” he says. “There was no two metres or anything like that.” In any case, says Andy, “the rules don’t make sense. You can’t go see your nana, but you can go to Primark? People are thinking: if you can go to Primark and buy yourself some thongs for a quid, you can go get some Es and get down a field and get out of your head.”It is not hard to see why illegal raves can act as a pressure valve for young people who have spent months indoors, away from their friends, schools, colleges or workplaces. “People feel trapped at the moment,” says Matty. “No one is on holiday. No one is at festivals. Nothing is open for the youth.”But it is more than that. For young people who have experienced only a commercialised club scene, illegal raves feel like discovering dance music in Technicolor. “Everything has got so commercial,” says Andy. “There was none of that. You could just do what you wanted.”“It feels like the 80s, like the resurgence of acid house,” says Katie, 23, who works in the music industry. She attended an illegal house music rave in woodland near Glasgow. “We had lockdown and now this is coming out of it … I think there will definitely be more and more raves throughout this summer.”Katie wore a face mask to her rave, but most people did not. A recent investigation by Vice into an illegal indoor rave found that clubbers had their temperatures taken on entry, as a precaution against coronavirus, but this was not the case at the rave Penny went to, which was held indoors. “If I was responsible for someone’s death, that would be awful,” she says.Spreading coronavirus is not the only thing that makes these raves so dangerous. At Daisy Nook, a 20-year-old man died of a drug overdose. In Carrington, three men were stabbed and a woman was raped. A girl was burned at the Kirkby rave. Two people were fatally shot at the Moss Side party. “These are dangerous places,” says Davies. “They tend to be derelict, there’s lots of water and electricity and they are isolated.” Even if you escape injury, rave-going can be a logistical nightmare. It took Katie and her friends hours to get home, after they persuaded a stranger who was camping nearby to give them a lift. “I did feel completely safe, but I definitely wouldn’t go alone as a woman,” says Katie.Yet, after so many months spent indoors, going out has never tasted so good. “It felt so lovely to let go for the night when everything is going crazy in the world,” says Katie. “And because it was risky, it gave you that extra bit of adrenaline.” Part of the thrill, too, is knowing that you got away with it. “Ah, mate,” whistles Andy. “It was a rush. We were proper buzzing all the way home.” They continued the party into Sunday daytime. Thankfully, Andy, who is a key worker, had taken Monday off.Promoters who don’t want their parties shut down by police should minimise the non-coronavirus risks. “Put security there,” Davies says. “Have adequate lighting. Don’t have your generator in a pool of water.” Although these raves are illegal under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Coronavirus Act 2020, police can exercise discretion when it comes to enforcing the legislation. “If we came across one that we deemed to be safe and there was no risk there, why would we cause the disruption to close it down?” says Davies.But what about when the party ends? Andy and his friends were in such a rush to get away from the site before police caught them that they did not clean up. “We tried our best,” he says, sounding sheepish. “But when it’s 6am and the sun’s coming up, and you’ve been up all night, you just want to get out of there.” Shulman is disapproving. “You’d never have had rubbish on the ground back in the day,” he says. “People were respectful.”It took 40 volunteers nine hours and 400 bin bags to clean up the devastation in Daisy Nook. Sandra Lord, a receptionist, was one of them. “It looked like a war zone,” she says, sighing. The promoters even left behind their equipment: having made £40,000 on £10-a-head tickets, Lord guesses that they did not fancy carrying it back up the hill. “I found used tampons, sanitary towels, faeces, wipes everywhere,” Lord says. Carroll’s neighbour found a used tampon in his hedge. Worse still were the thousands of discharged nitrous oxide gas canisters, which are made of metal and can be fatal to birds and other wildlife. “It was a sea of silver,” Lord says. “I couldn’t even guess how many of them I picked up. Thousands and thousands.”Despite the stakes for public health being so high, it is clear that something is catalysing in teenage bedrooms that were previously heavy with ennui: a second summer of rave, held in the squelching fields, tangled hedgerows and damp forests of Britain. Katie remembers looking up at the lights on the trees while dancing in the woodland near Glasgow. She says: “I had this feeling of: wow, people really will go far for a party, won’t they?”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecd4beae976d6cdedd2b846e0cf5cf3e6b1f79c/0_64_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3212df302b8a245869b2784b9ffd8492","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities.

Now the volunteer labour force has its sights on a new goal: a land-use revolution that will make UK farming more nature friendly, plant-based and resilient to future shocks.At Machynlleth, a bucolic town on the southern fringe of Snowdonia, the recently formed Planna Fwyd! (Plant Food!) movement is encouraging sheep farmers to ersify into vegetable production as their ancestors did. Teams of volunteers have sown crops of potatoes and, once or twice a week, they now fan across the slopes to tend gooseberry bushes, peas and squash. Others distribute seed packets to local families and run online classes on how to grow plants at home.“If the whole coronavirus experience has taught us anything, it is that we should be more self-sufficient. It was terrifying seeing the empty shop shelves,” said Chris Higgins, a retired academic who gets as much back as he gives from the voluntary work. “It’s very enriching. Growing and cooking food and working together is a great way of engaging with the local community and nature at the same time.”In the not-too-distant past, eco-farming in rural communes was considered a fringe activity, but many of its core concepts – local distribution, ersity and eco-system management – have become mainstream concerns in the wake of a pandemic that made the public appreciate the vitality of nature and the fragility of global supply chains.As the lockdown eases, Boris Johnson says the “nation is coming out of hibernation”, but unless more space is found for nature in the government’s recovery plans, wildlife will once again retreat, the soil degrade and the climate destabilise.History shows the folly of trying to return to business as usual after a pandemic. In the 14th century, the Black Death disrupted trade, left crops unharvested and prompted devastating famines. The aristocracy attempted to regain lost revenue and authority with higher taxes and more restrictions. This created the conditions for Wat Tyler’s Peasants Revolt and the Welsh war of independence led by Owain Glyndwr.Today’s rebels want greater food security, lower carbon emissions and healthier commons that can provide clean water, fresh air and a stable climate for everyone. This is not just the Landworkers Alliance and Extinction Rebellion Farmers, but academics and former ministers who say it makes good business sense.Machynlleth – the first seat of government for Glyndwr in the 15th century – is today among the most progressive rural communities in the UK. The landscape is recognised by UNESCO as a globally important biosphere, it is the site of the Centre of Alternative Technology, and its council was the first in Wales to declare a climate emergency.The small population of 2,200 people is also home to a disproportionate number of influential thinkers, including Jane Powell, the coordinator of the Wales Food Manifesto. The writer and activist said Covid-19 had instigated a clamour for food democracy. “It has mobilised people. There is a huge uprising of people volunteering to distribute or grow food. They’ve seen the fragility of global supply chains. I think it has given people a sense of ‘gosh, it’s up to us’. We’d like to be better prepared next time. We need more control and knowledge.”In Wales – as elsewhere in the UK – the pandemic exposed the risks of excessively specialising in sheep and cattle for export. This was already a concern due to Brexit, which will end subsidies and reduce markets, and a broader consumer trend to eat less meat. Lockdown brought a sudden dearth of vegetables and a glut of lamb. Shocked consumers are calling for a more reliable local supply. Welsh hill farmers are looking for new revenue streams either by planting crops or charging for ecosystem services, such as flood control, wildlife habitat and peatlands that absorb carbon dioxide.“This pandemic gives us the permission to think differently,” says former Welsh environment minister Jane Davidson. “The UK government, particularly in a post-Brexit scenario, has the biggest opportunity since 1974 to redefine the role of food in the economy and to create the stewards of the land to ensure the country is resilient.”Davidson is the woman behind one of the world’s most progressive pieces of legislation: the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, which was passed by the Welsh Assembly in 2015. This obliges policymakers to think long term and take environmental limits into account. She says food is at the heart of this approach. “We are realising what is important. It is not finance, it is food producers, delivery truck drivers and shop workers. States should create new opportunities around food production. That is the kind of decent work that sustains people during a crisis.”There is money to be made. Helen and Keith Lessiter run the vegetable, fruit and flower stalls at the farmers market in the Fishguard town hall. They have seen a surge in demand for seeds and plants. “We haven’t been so busy in 10 years,” says Helen. “Everybody wants to do their own growing. That is great. The more local production the better.”Farmers won kudos by donating to community support groups that kept people fed at a time of lay-offs and delayed social benefits that forced more than 6 million people to cut portions or skip meals. Rachel Stevens and Daniel Colborne, a middle-aged couple from Worcester, left jobs in engineering and factories to raise ducks, plant crops and create a woodland on a four-acre plot of land just outside Fishguard. At the start of lockdown, they lost sales from luxury hotels and instead donated their eggs to the “community fridge”, which distributes food to more than 300 residents. This helped them later benefit from the burgeoning “buy local” movement. “It has been a hard slog, but this crisis might help us in the long run. People have got a taste for what we have to offer.”Such dynamism and idealism at the local level could morph into frustration, resentment and protectionism if the UK government’s Covid-19 recovery plans involve rural funding cuts and a rushed trade deal with the US, which would flood supermarkets with cheap, low-quality imports.This is the fear of Sam Robinson, a shepherd, who lives just outside Machnylleth. He recently planted half an acre of potatoes for the first time, which he sees as part of a welcome return to mixed farming. “I am a defender of lamb and beef, but it is great to see a return of ersity,” he said. He also works on woodland creation projects for farmers. “We’re seeing a huge surge of interest,” he said. “But what we achieve depends on support. So far, the Welsh government has made this a priority, which means funding is available.”A change in land use is essential for the UK to get back on track towards its climate goals. Returning peatland, bogs and other habitats to their natural state could absorb as much as a third of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Wildlife Trust.Clive Faulkner, of the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said the region had proved it is possible to reskill farmers as environmental stewards and restore the land. “Twenty years ago people thought we were kooky, but now many are following.”He is now working on the holy grail of agrarian reform: how to value ecosystem services, find a buyer and establish a mechanism for payment. That had seemed within reach until Covid-19. Faulkner was given a grant from the Welsh government to set up pilot schemes. UK officials had discussed eco-system service payments as part of the agriculture bill, which is currently going through parliament.The fate of these long-term plans has been thrown up in the air by the pandemic and government urgency to jump-start the economy with a building boom.Faulkner urged the government not to neglect the countryside. “I worry about who will support the farming community,” he said. “Covid-19 is an amazing catastrophe, but it is not as systematic a threat as our broken relationship with the landscape.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd5a3e48760105b1209d9e88aa208e5add9ed7a/0_38_2340_1404/master/2340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=936bce4a798e78dac2f3bf98dfb37b88","title":"did you solve it the broken vase","story":"The shattering solutions to today’s puzzlesEarlier today I set the following three puzzles:1.

They also appeared to be able to control their aggression, and were less likely to lash out at other children during disagreements at school.Paul Ramchandani, professor of play in education, development and learning at the University of Cambridge and one of the authors of the study, said: “Physical play creates fun, exciting situations in which children have to apply self-regulation. You might have to control your strength, learn when things have gone too far – or maybe your father steps on your toe by accident and you feel cross.”“It’s a safe environment in which children can practise how to respond. If they react the wrong way, they might get told off, but it’s not the end of the world – and next time they might remember to behave differently.”Children who only live with their mother need not be at a disadvantage, the authors point out. All parent-child play interactions in the early years are linked to more positive cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes for children.“One of the things that our research points to time and again is the need to vary the types of play children have access to, and mothers can, of course, support physical play with young children as well,” Ramchandani said.Fellow author Dr Ciara Laverty, from the LEGO Foundation, said the findings had policy implications, suggesting structures were needed that give fathers, as well as mothers, time and space to play with their children during the early years.“Even today, it’s not unusual for fathers who take their child to a parent-toddler group, for example, to find that they are the only father there. A culture shift is beginning to happen, but it needs to happen more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e32ad6a9c080e341b7a07f4d31221f61822718/0_38_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd0fc58f648d2312c27a85c352d26f85","title":"black trans lives matter march in london in pictures","story":"Thousands of transgender people and supporters gathered in London to raise awareness about the discrimination and prejudices faced by the black transgender community.

Less than two years after being acquitted of affray in Bristol crown court, the role would continue the upward career trajectory that included being awarded an OBE for his heroics during the World Cup and Ashes campaigns last year.“Getting the opportunity to captain England is a huge honour, even if it is only the once you can still say: ‘Yeah I’ve captained England,’” Stokes said. “It’s a huge thing to think about and, if it does present itself, then obviously I’m really looking forward to it.”“I don’t normally like to speak about myself in this way but, looking back, I’m proud of what I’ve been able to do since that incident happened. It’s been through complete dedication and hard work towards the job I do.”Stokes jokingly told the online media conference that his on-field approach will be “nine slips and a gully” and while this may have overlooked the need for wicketkeeper, it summed up the 29-year-old’s desire to stamp his mark on the short‑term role. “I’ve been a senior player since 2016 and learning from Alastair Cook and Rooty has rubbed off on me. And we’ve got some really experienced guys who I can use Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, who’ve got ample Test matches and wickets between them. I’d like to think I’ll be an open captain and won’t think my way is the only way.”Stokes last captained 12 years ago – a Durham age-group side – and said he had not viewed himself as the successor to Root in the same way the Yorkshireman was next in line to Cook (who in turn had been groomed for the top job under Andrew Strauss).England have 30 players at the Ageas Bowl, which will be whittled down to an official Test squad on Saturday after a three-day warm-up match that begins on Wednesday. Stokes does not expect to have an input here but will still want to be leading a team of his choice out into the middle.“I think a lot of what guys do in training and what guys do in this warm-up will have an influence. You can only pick 11. I might not have as many friends after this Test.”West Indies have announced they will have the Black Lives Matter logo designed by Alisha Hosannah, partner of the Watford striker Troy Deeney, on their shirt collars during the first Test and England appear likely to follow suit. There may also be a collective gesture before the match amid growing talk of the players taking the knee.Anthems are expected to be played on the first morning, while television viewers are due to have the option of background crowd noise – most likely a track of the famous Lord’s hum – despite the absence of spectators.Asked about the lack of atmosphere in the grounds this summer, Stokes replied: “I don’t think it’s a struggle to get yourself up for playing for England. I think what the crowd does is gives you an extra bit of energy.“I don’t think that we can use that as an excuse for our levels of intensity. We’re walking on to the field representing England. You’ve got the Three Lions on your chest, it is a completely different situation to what we’re used to but everybody will be fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dedd6a304bafb151cbde4defc26983c0551b98a/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8407cac36832afa27f3951c59d26ad48","title":"team tactics never part of racing strategy promises aidan obrien","story":"Talking exclusively to Chris Cook, the trainer addresses concerns raised by two owners of Saturday’s Derby fanciesTeam tactics form no part of pre-race preparations at Ballydoyle, Aidan O’Brien insisted on Monday. “I promise you, never ever,” the trainer said when the subject was raised by the , concern having been expressed in public by the owners of the two horses currently at the head of the betting for Saturday’s Derby.“I can guarantee you, every horse runs on their merits to do their very best and there would never be a plan to do this or do that to any other horse,” said O’Brien, who will be seeking a record-breaking eighth Derby success this weekend. He has seven of the 17 possible runners at his stable in County Tipperary, though none are shorter than 7-1 in the betting.O’Brien has so many talented horses in his care that he usually has several runners in the best Flat races in Britain and Ireland, the most recent example being Saturday’s Irish Derby, in which he had six of the 14 who took part and ended up with the first four home. That means he is well placed to influence the way in which a race develops and his several runners are generally eyed with mistrust by rivals with a single runner.Sheikh Fahad, whose Kameko is second-favourite for the Derby, spoke up through Twitter after the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, saying: “There’s no place for team tactics in racing, such a shame to watch the St James run like that.”Sunday’s Racing Post brought another intervention, from Bjorn Nielsen, whose English King is the Derby favourite. “A lot of people with good horses are worried,” he said. “Team tactics threaten to devalue racing at the highest class. A pacemaker is one thing but sitting there and forming a peloton is quite another.”While he also did not name O’Brien, he spoke approvingly of Ger Lyons’s comments after the Irish Guineas, in which Siskin had to be strong to establish racing room among Ballydoyle runners. “We knew through the history books what the Ballydoyle riders were going to try to do,” Lyons said, though he added: “All is fair in love and war. It’s a big boys’ sport and you just put on your big boy pants and get out there and do the job.”O’Brien was careful not to use any names in his answers, saying at one point: “I don’t ever talk about anyone else’s horses or any other people. I would be always afraid that I would offend someone and that’s why I say very little most of the time.”But he insisted rivals had nothing to fear on this score. “Every single horse, I will always give the jockey what I think is the best instructions for that horse to win that race. Some horses want to be ridden forward, some horses like to be mid-, some horses like to be dropped in.” He noted an apparent assumption on the part of his rivals that, when he fields several runners, one of them will set the pace.“What happens a lot of the time, if one of our horses is not making the running, there’s no pace and the race becomes an absolute muddle, everyone is jockeying for positions. It can become very messy.”While he did not wish to cite an example, O’Brien feels sour grapes can be a factor in some of the things said about his operation. “Sometimes what happens is a big jockey or a big trainer, high profile, they might start crying after the race, to relieve pressure off themselves, for their owners or for some mistake that they made. And it’s easy for them to point the finger at us.”O’Brien expects to have at least six Derby runners. Armory may yet be erted to France, he says, but that would still leave Vatican City, Mogul, Russian Emperor, Amhran Na Bhfiann, Mythical and Serpentine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ad5516cfd55783090b45d23468bea7560f85c8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9677459dfdd12d76d4f5be9636c83db4","title":"who is the greatest female tennis player of the last 50 years","story":"With no Wimbledon to entertain us, let’s reminisce about the great players we have enjoyed watching in years gone byThere will be no Wimbledon this year, but we can still have a good debate about tennis.

In some ways it still is. But as an early adopter of western things, from ideas to clothes, it is easy to see Japan as a familiar place. Even its unfamiliarity – Shinto shrines, sumo bouts – is recognisable as “Japan” nowadays. What is less recognisable is what Japanese writers say about their own country. Authors – not the documentarists about families living with robots – uncover the mystery. These books speak for a Japan that is often spoken for and about, and speculated about by others they speak for its history as it unfolded, for its culture as it is practised and its society as lived in and fought against.Ryū Murakami’s stories never shy away from shining a light on the darkest corners of society. In this 1980 novel that beam is amplified as it follows the entire lives of protagonists Kiku and Hashi, and all the ghastly goings-on they encounter. Both “coin locker babies” – children abandoned in one of Japan’s coin lockers (an issue arising in the 1970s) – the boys find themselves adopted by a childless couple living on an island off Kyushu, the south-westernmost of Japan’s main islands. They grow up against a background of urban and rural decay. Soon transplanting themselves to “Toxitown”, a fictional area of mayhem in Tokyo – home, it seems, to all that is swept under the rug in Japan, from foreigners and homeless people to drug dealers and other criminals – what follows is a surreal coming-of-age horror story that runs wildly through the heights of love and superstardom, and the lows of insanity and murder.“A convenience store is a world of sound.” The opening line of narrator Keiko’s breathless story of working part-time at a konbini (convenience store) is wonderfully evocative. Throughout, she likens the sounds of the store to church bells, and herself and her coworkers as members of a religion. It’s not just a testament to the minutiae of Japan’s selection of Lawsons, 7-11s and Family Marts, but also an existential challenge to normality. In an attempt to become a member of society, Keiko becomes a “cog” by working at the convenience store, before finding out there’s more to it than that. Like Jean-Paul Sartre’s waiter who is too “waiter-esque”, Keiko embodies how a convenience store worker should act – Japanese society in miniature – but in doing so, she moves further away from actual society, with its conventional marriages and babies, and the haughty couples concerned with all that.Part Lord of the Flies, part Oedipus complex, this book is a postwar howl of anguish. Actor, model, director and author Mishima’s protagonist, Noburo, is an adolescent boy living with his single mother, Fusako, in Yokohama. He also happens to be in a nihilistic gang with his schoolmates who are superficially “good” students. Though sex is alluded to throughout – Noboru discovers a peephole into his mother’s bedroom, for one thing – it’s the extreme disappointment Noburo feels in Fusako’s new lover, a sailor named Ryuji, whom he once admired, that sets the wheels in motion for an altogether brutal plan to restore glory. In real life, Mishima grew disillusioned with Japan’s postwar situation, and in 1970 he – along with other members of a right-wing militia that he founded called Tatenokai – stormed a military base in Tokyo and attempted to inspire a coup, delivering a speech to soldiers stationed there. Met with jeers, he committed seppuku (ritual suicide with a sword).This depiction of the interactions and pursuits of Tokyoites is a gentle, modern-day version of the Edo period (1603-1858) ukiyo or “floating world”, referring to the era’s burgeoning urban lifestyle. Kawakami’s transient world is one of endless dining out at izakaya (Japanese bars), of hanami (flower viewing) parties during cherry blossom season, and discussing baseball, a national obsession. Now, add the story of a thirtysomething woman’s growing relationship with a much older man, whom she calls “Sensei” – an elder-junior theme somewhat echoing Natsume Soseki’s bestselling Kokoro – and Strange Weather In Tokyo will have sweep you up in a heartwarming haze. Sōseki’s inaugural novel satirises Japan’s Meiji era (1868-1912), and its uneasy adoption of western ideas, through the life of a schoolteacher — his stupidity, his circle of friends, and what he does with his time. He’s a regular member of middle-class Tokyo, and is a fussy sort of person who gets annoyed when the neighbourhood children keep hitting a ball into his garden with a wooden stick (baseball had newly arrived in Japan at this time). The twist is that the whole novel is narrated by a cat with a holier-than-thou attitude, a wild take on authorship at any point in time, but even more so considering this novel’s serialisation from 1905-06. Japanese features multiple pronouns for “I”, but the cat uses wagahai to refer to itself (a high-register phrasing more appropriate to a nobleman), rare even at the time of publication. But the popularity of the book resulted in a resurgence of wagahai – and is still infrequently used by fictional, anthropomorphised characters.An insight into Japan’s past as much as a blueprint for understanding the country’s idiosyncratic style of westernisation, Tanizaki spins a web of conflicting interests in his 1929 novel. Kaname and his wife Misako are married, but not happily. Kaname’s father-in-law, “the old man”, thinks orce is out of the question, a western solution for problems caused by western ideas. Attempting to instil Japanese ideals in the couple and his young mistress, O-Hisa, the old man hopes to uphold traditions as Japan changes around him. Kaname, however, loves western things. He admires American film stars of the day. His dog even has an English name.Perhaps owing to the 2006 translation by Meredith McKinney, The Pillow Book reads as naturally as if it had been written today. Except it was written in the 990s and early 1000s by a lady-in-waiting of Fujiwara no Teishi, empress consort of Emperor Ichijo. This era in Japanese history, the Heian period (794-1185), was one of great significance – to nobles, anyway. Sei’s book is basically a collection of random thoughts, an ancient blog. She makes lists – of rivers, markets and other places that are either famous or have some poetic connection, or both – and writes opinionated indices with titles such as “people who seem enviable” and “things with terrifying names”. Most of the time, however, she provides a window into the courtly world: nocturnal visits from men, Shinto festivals, and the constant exchanging of witty poems between courtiers like carefully considered tweets.Dazai may be better known for his swansong – the autobiographical No Longer Human (1948) – but it is Schoolgirl, a 1939 novella, that made him famous. Narrated by the eponymous girl, the book is an unsung, prewar Japanese Catcher in the Rye for her everything is depressing, pathetic, disgusting: “Mornings are torture.” The narrator is sometimes an androgynous voice, at odds with herself and the world around her, but 81 years after publication her thoughts chime with the modern day. Possibly a veiled critique by Dazai (who was a Marxist) of ultranationalism, the schoolgirl is at one point “bored” by a teacher who went “on and on, explaining to us about patriotism, but wasn’t that pretty obvious? I mean, everyone loves the place where they were born.”The title may put some off, and depending on what edition is available, it may or may not have an electric pink cover, but Vibrator is glorious. The novel is set in Tokyo, at least for a bit, as protagonist Rei Hayakawa begins yet another trip down to her local convenience store. She’s a bulimic freelance writer who drinks too much, by the way. After a chance encounter at the store with a truck driver, Okabe, she leaves her usual, self-destructive routine and hops in his cab for a road trip. Japan’s highways are not pretty and its winter landscape is not always the delicate woodblock print scenes you may know, but this book shows both in their supreme mundanity as Rei journeys to the deep north with a stranger, and further into herself.Only half of this book takes place in Japan. That’s because every other chapter is set somewhere that exists (or doesn’t exist) called the “The End of the World”, whose inhabitants are poignantly mindless, perhaps soulless even. Every chapter in between, on the other hand, is set an alternate Tokyo, “Hard-Boiled Wonderland”, in which the narrator works as a sort of human data-processing machine. It’s a head-scratcher of a story. The nameless narrator spends a memorable portion of the novel below ground, in a monstrous kind of sewer system crawling with up-to-date kappa (amphibious demons of Japanese folklore), emerging from this secret subterranean labyrinth at Aoyama-itchōme station, one of a handful of Tokyo locations name-dropped throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b570591a13c416c006d068164d7e4d00005bc3/66_0_1993_1196/master/1993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f69c1890b1ed8263937698067d4e682","title":"italys frontline a doctors diary review a superhero more beckett than marvel","story":"This documentary following a heroic doctor treating coronavirus patients in northern Italy in March and April already feels like a valuable historical document“Why didn’t you become a house painter?” Michele asked his wife, Dr Francesca Mangiatordi. He was joking, but he had a point. If Francesca hadn’t been an A\u0026ampE doctor this spring in the northern Italian city of Cremona, working 12-hour shifts at a hospital overrun with Covid-19 patients, things might have been easier for the Mangiatordi family.“We haven’t hugged each other for a month,” she said. Nor had she touched her son or daughter. That was not just sensible but remarkable, given that they live in a small flat.The news told the Mangiatordis that Italy had overtaken China as the country with the most Covid-19 deaths. Although the director, Sasha Joelle Achilli, filmed this intimate, moving, bleak diary in March and April, the pandemic has swept on so unremittingly since that it felt like a historical document.Francesca’s children veered between hero-worship for their mother and terror over what she might bring home. “I imagine mum like Captain America in Avengers: Endgame,” said 13-year-old Damiano. It’s not a perfect analogy – Covid-19’s endgame is more Beckett than Marvel.Every day, his mother did battle with something beyond Captain America’s skill set. She dealt with bed and oxygen tank shortages, decided whether a 35-year-old or an 85-year-old should get the single remaining free bed, decoded lung scans and phoned the nearest and dearest to say their loved one had just died alone. “There’s no dignity any more,” said Francesca, tired eyed and tearful, to camera at the end of her shift.“I’m scared she might bring it home not so much for me or my brother, but because of my father,” the 11-year-old daughter, Maria Teresa, confided to camera. She imagined what would happen if the virus killed her parents. “I don’t know how to cook and him neither,” she said, breaking into sobs. “Without them, we don’t know how to do anything.”Although Francesca did not contract the virus, her best friend at hospital, Dr Laura Bocchi, did. “I’m a patient and, unfortunately, I possess medical knowledge that sometimes makes my fears worse,” said Laura. She self-isolated in her son’s bedroom. She only saw her son and husband on video calls from different rooms in the same apartment. Every now and again, Laura would appear silhouetted at the frosted glass of the bedroom door, a spectral figure in a little flat pressing a hand against glass in a futile reach for human contact.Achilli’s genius was for capturing the quotidian human struggle for dignity against the odds. While 30-year-old Crystal awaited the result of tests in a hospital corridor, she rang her husband. She told him to go into another room so their three daughters could not hear. “I don’t know yet, Sebastian. Don’t say anything in front of the girls.”Everyone in this documentary was so beautiful that their tragedy reminded me of the one in Nanni Moretti’s 2001 Palme d’Or winning film, La Stanza del Figlio (The Son’s Room), in which a beautiful family’s beautiful son drowns, leaving his family decorously bereft. It seemed wrong that such tragedy should afflict anyone, but doubly wrong that it should afflict them.Add to this the fact that Achilli marginalised death and foregrounded survival, and you’ll understand my slight misgivings about the film. There was one short scene in which a corpse was taken down a dimly lit corridor to the mortuary and placed in a coffin by dignified staff. Otherwise, death was the unseen predator lurking behind these heartening stories of those who made it through.Achilli’s film nonetheless works as a moral lesson from humanity’s better selves about how we should behave with restraint and care for others in extremis rather than, say, sullying the name of Barnard Castle or wrecking Bournemouth.The hour-long documentary was threaded through with the story of 18-year-old Mattia, taken into intensive care with the virus engulfing his lungs. Hardly anyone made it out of the intensive care unit (ICU) with such symptoms, said nurse Cristina Pilati. His mother wrote in the local newspaper asking the nurses to do what she could not: hold him.Ultimately, like Crystal and Laura, Mattia fought off the virus. After 12 days in the ICU, he lay chastened in a recovery bed. “I remember that I sent my last texts. I gave my phone to the doctors.” An older patient in the next bed said: “After an experience like that, what could possibly scare you? Nothing!” Mattia looked thoughtful. Perhaps, his expression said. Perhaps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb16c133ab32196166fdfe5982c2a5d6b7643347/0_165_4962_2977/master/4962.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=356b193425a325ed8eaf432c61c61e22","title":"all children in england back at school in september","story":"All pupils expected to return on full timetable, with year groups separated in secondaries, guidance saysAll children in England will be expected to go back to school in September on a full timetable, with secondary pupils kept in “Covid-secure” year groups to limit transmission of the virus, according to leaked guidance.The government is said to be keen to avoid a “vague and woolly” start to the new academic year after months of uncertainty since schools closed to the majority of pupils in March, as part of a national effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Official guidance due to be published on Thursday is expected to advise secondary headteachers in England to keep entire year groups separate throughout the school day, with staggered start and end times, as well as lunch and break times.Specialist teachers will however be able to move between year groups, to ensure that pupils are taught the full curriculum where possible. Plans for primary school children, who are currently taught in “protective bubbles” of 15, will allow for them to be taught by a single teacher in groups of 30, which is the usual class size.Until recently the need for social distancing has been a key stumbling block to government ambitions to get all children back in school in England, but the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, indicated on Monday that a full return to school in the autumn was not dependent on social distancing.“It’s not about 1 metre, it’s not about 2 metres,” he told BBC Breakfast, saying that safety would be based on “reducing the number of transmission points” within schools. He also confirmed that from September parents would be fined if their children did not attend schools without a good reason.According to detailed plans reported by Huffpost UK, the government is keen to see a return to the full curriculum where possible, but secondary schools are expected to be told to focus on the core subjects, with some year 11 pupils allowed to drop other GSCEs to allow them to concentrate on English and maths.The NHS test-and-trace system is seen as a critical element in ensuring a safe return for all pupils, with plans for classes or entire year groups to be sent home if a pupil tests positive. All schools will be expected to draw up contingency plans in the event of a partial closure or local lockdown, with renewed pressure on teachers to provide high-quality remote teaching if children cannot be at school.Significant challenges remain, particularly around transport to and from school where it will be more difficult for schools to manage behaviour. It is understood pupils will be advised to walk or cycle where possible, while those on public transport aged 11 and above will be expected to wear face masks.Richard Sheriff, chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which includes nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and North Yorkshire, said: “I’m fully expecting all children to be back in school on a full timetable from September. The government is going to be very, very keen to make sure this is not a vague and woolly start. This is going back to a fully functioning, rich, deep curriculum as quickly as possible.”Hamid Patel, the chief executive of Star Academies, which runs a string of outstanding state schools in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, added: “While class-based bubbles work for primary schools, the complexity of setting and options choices means secondary school bubbles should be on a year-group basis.“A bubble would occupy a set of ‘home base’ classrooms in close proximity to each other to restrict pupils’ movement. Pupils would receive as much subject teaching as possible within these. They could move between rooms in their bubble to facilitate setting arrangements but would not move beyond their assigned area unless there was a specific need to utilise another space. Where spaces occupied by one bubble need to be used by another bubble, thorough disinfection would be required before and after.”Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the leaked plans were “quite some way from being satisfactory for schools”. The Department for Education has been contacted for comment.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Pupils have been returning to school since 1 June – we’ve already given primary schools the flexibility to invite more children back if they have the capacity, and 1.5 million children were in school at the end of last week.“We’ve said we want to see all children back at school in September – returning to full primary and secondary class sizes in a safe way. We continue to engage with school leaders, teaching unions and the wider sector about our plans and will publish full details later this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef08f2c032d5d9504b64c8efde5bae8c06289c/126_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97f42eeeb9bb8bc0fd637302cfd4506f","title":"have differing approaches to social distancing rules caused issues in your family","story":"We want to hear from people who have experienced issues with family or friends over different approaches to physical distancingThe prime minister has confirmed that the 2-metre rule would be dropped in favour of a “1-metre-plus” approach, as people from two different households will be able to drink or dine together from 4 July in England.However, those who are more at risk or vulnerable may choose to continue to maintain the 2-metre rule or wear face masks or gloves.We want to hear from people who have experienced any issues with friends or family over different approaches to physical distancing.We are keen to hear from more than one person in the same familycouplefriendship group, if they have differing views.

Israeli media widely suggested that the timing could slip beyond Wednesday.That prompted Netanyahu to tell a private meeting of his own Likud members that the issue “was not up to” Gantz’s Blue and White party and that “discreet” contacts with the US were continuing.Gantz’s intervention comes on top of mounting international opposition to the move and reported cooling in the Trump administration over the push to annex imminently.But both Jordan and the Palestinian leadership, backed by key EU countries and Gulf states, have made clear that they regard any move towards unilateral annexation as illegal, no matter how limited, with Jordan threatening to withdraw from or downgrade its 1994 peace treaty with Israel.That view was echoed by the UN’s top human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, on Monday.“Annexation is illegal. Period,” Bachelet said in a statement. “I am deeply concerned that even the most minimalist form of annexation would lead to increased violence and loss of life, as walls are erected, security forces deployed and the two populations brought into closer proximity.”The UN secretary general, the EU and key Arab countries have all warned that annexation would violate international law and all but destroy any remaining hopes of establishing a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel.It also remained unclear whether a series of meetings of senior officials in the Trump administration last week had managed to bridge gaps, with Jared Kushner – Trump’s son-in-law and architect of the administration’s much-criticised “peace plan” – reportedly urging caution over the risk of damage to US ties in the Gulf and elsewhere.In a rare op-ed in an Israeli newspaper, the Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, warned earlier in June that annexation of parts of the West Bank would jeopardise any warming of Arab-Israeli ties. Describing it as the “illegal seizure of Palestinian land”, Otaiba said: “Plans for annexation and talk of normalisation are a contradiction.”Donald Trump’s peace plan, unveiled last January, envisions leaving a third of the West Bank under permanent Israeli control – granting the Palestinians autonomy in the remainder of the area. The proposal was comprehensively rejected by the Palestinians.Unlike the Trump administration’s unilateral and controversial decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the annexation debate has brought into play a multitude of competing considerations including whether an Israeli decision to annex would undercut the Trump administration’s own one-sided plan.Within his own cabinet Netanyahu faces resistance both from Gantz and from the foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, complicating issues for the White House which has said it wants to see a unified Israeli front.Instead Gantz has argued for an approach agreed with Israel’s partners in the region and with the Palestinians, “to arrive at an outline that benefits all sides in a responsible, proportional and reciprocal manner”.A source in his party told local media that “Gantz made clear in the meeting that 1 July is not a sacred date” and expressed a desire for Israel to deal with the economic ravages of the coronavirus crisis.Underlining the sense of uncertainty, pro-settler political figures accused Netanyahu of “giving up” on plans to annex the Jordan valley in favour of more-limited moves. Among them was the MP and former justice minister Ayelet Shaked who accused Netanyahu of preparing to abandon the plan.However, other pro-settler figures have also voiced opposition to the annexation plan with David Elhayani, who chairs the Yesha Council representing settlers, describing it on Israel’s Army Radio this month as like being “offered cake at gunpoint”.Speaking on Monday, Israel Gantz, the head of Binyamin regional council, which represents several dozen Jewish settlements in the West Bank, echoed the uncertainty.“Today we are waiting for the prime minister. You all heard about the United States team and the Israeli team, but as far as I know they don’t have any agreements. So we are waiting to see,” he said.He added he would be happy with any annexation, no matter how partial, but would campaign to extend it.“Every bit of sovereignty here, we will be thankful, we will thank the prime minister and President Trump,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cf4540f6f27293d6505e1f90a5d5c38e7b293a2/0_97_8891_5336/master/8891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1399c5fa627f9e245c03959466984ed","title":"sturgeon refuses to rule out scotland screening visitors from england","story":"First minister’s comments come after public health expert said people arriving from England could also be asked to self-isolateNicola Sturgeon has said she cannot rule out introducing quarantining or screening for travellers coming from England if infection rates rise south of the border.The first minister said her government intended to eliminate coronavirus from Scotland after disclosing there had been no deaths in Scottish hospitals from confirmed Covid-19 for four days, with only 10 people now in intensive care.Sturgeon said securing its elimination needed “hard-headed” public health policies, suggesting several times in her daily briefing on Monday she believed Scotland’s strategies were more effective than in other parts of the UK.She said she had no plans at present for any special measures for people travelling from England but pointed at decisions by US states such as New York and New Jersey to quarantine travellers from US hotspots, and localised quarantine measures in Germany.Prof Devi Sridhar, a public health specialist who advises Sturgeon’s government on its coronarivus strategies, suggested on Sunday travellers arriving from England could need to be screened, tested or asked to self-isolate if infection rates rose there.“I said I’ve no plans to introduce anything like this just now but I’m not ruling anything out, if it’s required from a public health perspective,” Sturgeon told reporters on Monday, but did not directly answer a question on what measures could be involved.There had been a surge of case in Leicester, she said, adding to her “deep sense of anxiety” that people may be dropping their guard too soon.“We haven’t come this far over the last three months surely simply to allow our infection rates to start having to spiral again, so we’re going to have to be really hard-headed from a public health perspective here.”Sturgeon accused No 10 of failing to discuss its plans with her government about creating “air bridges” to allow travellers from selected EU countries to sidestep the 14-day quarantine rules.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that CHina had previously been able to lift.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Rejecting Downing Street’s claims the UK government had worked closely with the three devolved administrations, Sturgeon said: “We cannot simply be dragged along on decisions we have no knowledge of, that we don’t understand the basis of and might be wrong for our circumstances.”Sturgeon said she and her advisers were waiting to study the UK government’s data and analysis before deciding whether to copy its air bridges strategy, and urged Johnson to clarify what his government’s strategy was.“I would really welcome a statement from the prime minister that England’s strategy was about trying to eliminate the virus as well, as opposed to what appears to me to be letting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesn’t threaten or overwhelm the National Health Service.“So we have to keep these things under review if we want to keep our levels of infection as low as we can get them and why do we want to do that? Because the lower we can get them the more normality we can get back to.“One of the biggest prizes is getting children back to school full-time and if we see infection rates rising over the summer, that will be harder to do.”Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, said Sturgeon should rule out imposing any controls on travellers crossing the border. “While it may be that localised lockdowns will be needed to deal with inidual flare-ups over the months ahead, they should be handled as such,” he said.“This should not be used as an issue to drive a wedge between Scotland and England.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f48c798bc7afcf250f4746362aeeb625374347/0_340_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5300db8788099c53a655c91abb28eaf","title":"new swine flu with pandemic potential identified by china researchers","story":"Researchers in China have discovered a new type of swine flu that is capable of triggering a pandemic, according to a study in the US science journal PNAS.Named G4, it is genetically descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009.It possesses “all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans”, said the authors, scientists at Chinese universities and China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the study published on Monday.Between 2011 and 2018, researchers took 30,000 nasal swabs from pigs in slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces and in a veterinary hospital, allowing them to isolate 179 swine flu viruses.The majority were of a new kind that has been dominant among pigs since 2016.The researchers then carried out various experiments – including on ferrets, which are widely used in flu studies because they experience similar symptoms to humans.G4 was observed to be highly infectious, replicating in human cells and causing more serious symptoms in ferrets than other viruses do.Tests also showed that any immunity humans gain from exposure to seasonal flu does not provide protection from G4.More than one in 10 swine workers had already been infected, according to antibody blood tests which showed exposure to the virus.The virus has therefore already passed from animals to humans but there is no evidence yet that it can be passed from human to human – the scientists’ main worry.“It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,” the researchers wrote.The authors called for urgent measures to monitor people working with pigs.James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said: “The work comes as a salutary reminder that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of zoonotic pathogens and that farmed animals – with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife – may act as the source for important pandemic viruses.” A zoonotic infection is caused by a pathogen that has jumped from a non-human animal into a human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b599b3cb4f5632787c13db897a19fad3ee98b2d/0_242_5134_3081/master/5134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f166d1f933c771033cb5dfd9b630cf2","title":"scat

parkWhile their preferred snack of senbei rice crackers are a nutritious combination of flour and rice bran, the deer simply ate too many of them, triggering a raging thirst.“I suspect some deer ended up drinking too much water,” Yoshitaka Ashimura, secretary-general of the foundation for the protection of deer in Nara, told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.That, he said, took a toll on the animals’ health, causing gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhoea.But now, deprived of their regular supply of senbei crackers, the deer have been forced to seek out more of their traditional staple diet of plants and nuts.The result has been a transformation in their health, evidenced by the piles of perfectly formed pellet-like droppings affectionately referred to as “black beans”.Nara’s deer, which have been known to attack visitors who tease them with food or try to take selfies with them, are believed to be ine messengers and were designated natural treasures in 1957.The animals have the dramatic plunge in visitor numbers to thank for their improved bowel movements.An estimated 2.58 million people visited Nara prefecture in 2018 – an almost 10-fold increase from 2012 – leading to a spate of deaths among animals who swallowed plastic bags and food wrappers discarded by tourists.While the trend has hit businesses in Nara, it has brought an unexpected benefit for residents.Not only are the animals’ droppings more compact, said Toshiharu Takaki, a regular visitor to the deer park for 40 years, “they also stink less”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b91d71e0059515fa84a6fac6fa1988c5a2a115e/0_388_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=920edce86341fce43077b82dfd8bbb0a","title":"tuesday briefing leicesters local lockdown","story":"Schools and non-essential shops to close … PM to launch ‘New Deal’ for Covid-19 recovery … and British theatre’s first gay kissGood morning and welcome to the top stories on this last day of June.All non-essential shops in Leicester will be closed from this morning, and schools will close from Thursday (apart from for vulnerable children and those of essential workers) in the first local lockdown in England. Addressing the Commons at around 9pm last night, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, described the “difficult but important decisions” to reimpose measures on the city, which has seen nearly 950 new infections in a fortnight: “Given the growing outbreak in Leicester, we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown, set to take place on 4 July,” he said. Hancock said this meant people should “stay home as much as you can” and avoid all non-essential travel to, from and within the city. Overnight Leicester council’s website said it was awaiting confirmation of all areas that would be affected, but Hancock said it would apply to the surrounding areas of the city, including Oadby, a town three miles south, and the villages of Glenfield and Birstall, three miles north. The changes will be reviewed in two weeks. The details of what’s being imposed are here.Leicester’s lockdown comes ahead of Boris Johnson’s speech in the West Midlands today, in which he will promise a “New Deal” for Britain in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The PM will highlight projects worth £5bn, which he will “accelerate”, including improvements to schools and hospitals, and “shovel ready” schemes. But critics will likely highlight there is no new money in the announcement. Downing Street insists the speech is not part of a relaunch after a number of bruising weeks for the government, but No 10 is keen to restore its grip on the news agenda with upbeat messaging about the future. Environmental experts have expressed dismay with the “New Deal” and the ’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, says having adored Churchill, Johnson is now flirting with former US president Franklin D Roosevelt, whose economic programme of the 1930s bore the same name.In other coronavirus news, the chancellor is expanding a £500m fund for UK startups hit by the pandemic, to ensure firms that shifted their headquarters abroad can still access the scheme. All children in England will be expected to go back to school in September on a full timetable, with secondary pupils kept in “Covid-secure” year groups to limit transmission of the virus, according to leaked guidance. Nicola Sturgeon has said she cannot rule out introducing quarantining or screening for travellers coming from England if infection rates rise south of the border. The lockdown has been devastating for mental health in the UK and the worst could be yet to come, according to the charity Mind, which says the government must take urgent action to prevent an even bigger crisis in future. There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice.Hong Kong new security laws – Beijing has passed a sweeping national security law that critics fear will crush political freedoms in Hong Kong and pave the way for China to cement its control over the semi-autonomous territory. The standing committee of the National People’s Congress approved measures that will criminalise secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Rape cases – The Crown Prosecution Service secretly dropped “weak” cases, according to rights groups. They include cases where a woman was held at knifepoint, a film of an attack was found on a suspect’s phone and an alleged perpetrator admitted the offence in text messages. The details will be submitted to an ongoing government review of how rape is treated throughout the criminal justice system. They include statements from dozens of rape victims whose cases were not prosecuted and an account by a CPS whistleblower.Child’s play – Children whose fathers spend time playing with them at a very early age may find it easier to control their behaviour and emotions, which has a beneficial impact as they get older and start school, according to a new study. Research carried out by Cambridge University’s faculty of education and the LEGO Foundation looked at how mothers and fathers play with children aged 0 to 3 years and how it affects child development. While there are many similarities, it found that fathers tend to engage in more physical play like tickling, chasing and piggy-back rides, which researchers claim appears to help children to learn to control their feelings.‘Wonderful works’ – Paintings that show the first gay kiss in British theatre history and an extravagant drag ball have been acquired for the nation in lieu of inheritance tax. Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex has announced it is now the owner of five paintings by Leonard Rosoman from the 1960s. “They are really wonderful works,” said the gallery’s director, Simon Martin. The paintings shine light on a stage production that was a fascinating chapter in LGBTQ+ history, and one that helped pave the way for the abolition of theatre censorship.The World Health Organization is planning to send a team to China to investigate the origins of the coronavirus. Its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Monday that the pandemic was far from over and that he feared “the worst is still to come” unless isions over the virus are replaced with international unity.In the US, Arizona has reimposed lockdown restrictions, following in the footsteps of Texas, Florida and California, and Broadway shows will not return this year, according to the industry’s trade association.Sirin Kale looks at the shocking return of rave parties, in breach of lockdown laws. And today’s Long Read looks at one UK hospital cleaner’s remarkable journey through the pandemic, and the fight for a better deal for NHS workers.This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round.

Converted from a mosque to a museum by the Turkish Republic’s secular founder, Mustafa Kamal Atatürk, a decision will be made this week on the building’s final status and is expected to be fully restored to its Muslim heritage. As Bethan McKernan writes from Istanbul, the move would be the boldest message to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s detractors both at home and abroad that his country has decisively turned away from its alliances with the west in pursuit of a greater Neo-Ottoman destiny.Racial bias is a clear and significant problem in English football commentary, according to a groundbreaking study. Ben Stokes is preparing to step up as England captain for the first Test against West Indies next week and he believes this honour has come about after responding to the notorious Bristol incident of 2017 with sheer hard work. The England and Wales Cricket Board has given a green light for the return of professional domestic cricket but it is not entirely clear where this green light leads. Burnley moved up to eighth in the Premier League after Ben Mee’s header gave them a 1-0 win at Crystal Palace. The Derby and former Liverpool defender Andre Wisdom is in hospital after being stabbed and robbed during a street attack. And the Watford forward Andre Gray has apologised after a breach of lockdown rules led to him being dropped at the weekend.More than 300,000 planned new homes may remain on the drawing board over the next five years, deepening the UK’s housing crisis, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, new research predicts. Stalled construction and the recession will slash the number of new homes being built, with 85,000 predicted to be lost this financial year, according to a study by the property agency Savills with the housing charity Shelter. Construction of the cheapest social housing could fall to a “catastrophic” low of 4,300 units annually – the smallest number since the second world war. Shelter said this would not even be enough to clear the waiting list for a social home in Wakefield, never mind the rest of the country.

Walking arm-in-arm would not be advised under the guidance.The guidance was published alongside advice for the restarting of communal worship on 4 July. Places of worship will be able to hold services for more than 30 people, but distancing guidelines should be adhered to.Hymn books should be quarantined for 48 hours after use, while worshippers will be advised to take their own religious texts or prayer mats. Donations should be collected via contactless devices or online, where possible, or cash should be placed in a receptacle that is set in one place and not passed around.Where food and drink is essential to the act of worship, it will be permitted, but the sharing of food should be avoided – as well as the use of communal vessels. Those giving and receiving food should wash their hands before and after consumption, or wear gloves.Singing, chanting, shouting and the playing of wind instruments should also be avoided because of the potential for increased risk of Covid-19 transmission from aerosol and droplets.Organs can be played for faith practices, but music should be played at a volume that does not require worshippers to raise their voices.“Lifecycle events” such as baptisms and bar mitzvahs should also have no more than 30 people present, unless the event is part of a routine communal worship service."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285251.1592819773!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"twelve things covid 19 has taught us about education and schooling","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSchool plays a fundamental role in our broader society, supporting children to thrive and flourish in a holistic way. Photograph: iStockAs the school year draws to a close, it is an opportune time to reflect on what we have learned about education and schooling over the past few months. While there is a sense that everyone is fed up, the uncertainty of what is to come with the physical reopening of schools weighs heavily on many people’s minds.The physical closure of schools during the lockdown has presented many challenges. It has evoked a range of responses initially characterised by an appreciation for our teachers and the work they do, to a more recent rhetoric of criticism and frustration that teachers and schools are doing too much or not doing enough. It is the stuff of rock and hard place.Many children have struggled for a variety of reasons. They miss their friends, teachers and SNAs and, no matter how hard we try, a Zoom call with 30 children quickly descends into disorganised chaos filled with the joy of seeing each other and the frustration of not being able to speak and interact with friends in a really dynamic way.It has been well documented by organisations such as the Children’s Rights Alliance that children who are particularly vulnerable within our society have been especially impacted by school closures, including those living in poverty, children who have additional needs and those who require specialised support and care.Very quickly the digital ide has emerged, with profound implications for students who don’t have access to the technology, wifi or digital literacy required to engage with online schooling. Many students are grappling with additional care responsibilities limiting their ability to engage in learning.There are symbolic occasions along the educational journey that are considered rites of passage, moments of transition, marking and celebrating with the wider community how our young people are progressing within the education system. Children will now engage in transitions (such as into primary school, from junior to senior school, from primary to secondary school) missing out on the traditional celebrations, preparations and rituals. This is no more evident than marking the end of primary and secondary education where graduation ceremonies bring communities together to celebrate young people’s achievements and to prepare them for this formative step into the future.So, what has Covid-19 taught us about education and schooling?1. School is more than a physical building. It is the heart of a community. It is the fulcrum which draws us together on a daily basis. School plays a fundamental role in our broader society, supporting children to thrive and flourish in a holistic way. It defines the fibre of who we are as Irish citizens and how we understand ourselves, and our rights, within the broader globalised world.2. Relational and socioemotional dynamics comprise the fabric of schooling. Schools and classrooms are fundamentally embedded within the complexity of the relational. Teachers care deeply. The work of teachers and SNAs is deeply embedded within the relational and emotional work of building, nurturing and supporting relationships. These relationships are so important in supporting children’s learning and holistic development through a pedagogy of empathy. As hard as many have tried, this is extremely challenging to replicate through the school virtual learning environment. The work of curriculum cannot be effectively realised when detached from the relational.3. Education and schooling is innately pastoral with care and empathy at its core. This has most recently been evidenced in the outreach activities of schools delivering food parcels, resources and social and emotional support to children and their families. Much of the work undertaken by teachers and SNAs in our classrooms is embedded within this ethic of care and empathy. Schools are particularly conscious of supporting children’s wellbeing as they transition back into the classroom in August.4. Performativity holds higher status than process. John Dewey, a prominent educational reformer, stated that “education is not preparation for life education is life itself”. Yet the evidence of what has been achieved by our students and teachers is measured using performative aspects of education. This ranges from the use of predictive grades in the Leaving Certificate to evaluating interactions and portfolios through online platforms. Although there is an increasing emphasis on continuous assessment, it is still summative assessment which garners most weight and power in deciding children and young people’s trajectory within the education system.5. Deis is an essential resource for supporting our most vulnerable communities. This scheme has, without doubt, proven its worth during the pandemic. Schools working under the Deis scheme have supported children and their families, not only in terms of their engagement with learning, but also in terms of providing food, pastoral care and emotional support as communities grapple to cope in this profoundly changed environment. The widening gap in attainment that will emerge from school closures will be profound, impacting not only in terms of learning and socioemotional outcomes, but also in terms of future life experiences and opportunities. Greater and sustained investment in Deis will be required to further support schools as they negotiate the pandemic with their pupils and communities.6. Collaboration between schools and support services is crucial. Schools are at the epicentre of our children’s lives. Outside of familial and care networks, schools are where children spend the majority of their time as they negotiate their childhoods. They become important sites for identifying and supporting any additional needs pupils might have. In order to ensure cohesion to support the needs of children it is imperative that there are adequate support services available and that they adopt a collaborative and integrative approach with schools.7. Schooling at distance is highly problematic. Notwithstanding the above discussion, engaging children in school work at a distance creates a deep educational chasm. Not only does it ide teachers from pupils, it serves to create fractures in how we understand teaching and learning within our broader society. Classrooms have suddenly become public property, a free for all, open to critique based on assumptions rather than on deep pedagogical understanding. Connectedness plays an integral role in engaging children in learning in school and yet the screen often becomes a barrier between the learner and their wider learning community. The more removed the emotional and relational aspect of learning, the greater the distance between school and the learner.8. Daily interactions are fundamental to learning in school. Children’s friendships and their relationships with their teachers and SNAs are critical to supporting their positive experience in school. The greeting at the door, the smile on the corridor, the high-five, the positive affirmation, the nod of reassurance all play an important role in signalling children’s sense of belonging and achievement in school. These informal interactions are as important as the structured lesson planning and delivery of resources. They contribute to children’s sense of learner identity while building their confidence for engaging in the classroom.9. Learning should be fun to foster creativity and innovation. Engaging children in fun, self-directed activities allows them to explore, take risks, build confidence and learn new skills ultimately fostering their creativity and innovation. The importance of creativity and innovation has emerged as especially important for problem solving during the pandemic. It is important that we don’t lose playfulness or fun in education and school.10. It is inequitable to make assumptions about learner access to resources at home. We cannot assume children have equal access to resources to engage in learning at home. This includes equipment (such as printers, laptops, stationary), place (a table to work at) and time to learn (especially if they have additional carework responsibilities).11. Technology enables and excludes learners. Technology has emerged as a really important lifeline for us all during the pandemic. It has enabled schools to contact and engage with pupils in myriad ways and on an array of platforms. Indeed, at this point in time we are all well and truly Zoomed, Seesawed, Kahooted, Padleted and Aladdined out. However, it has also served to exclude, particularly those who do not have the resources (laptop, wifi, software) or digital literacy they need to meaningfully engage. Such a paradox is inequitable and requires urgent attention.12. A positive and open relationship between home and school is imperative. The pandemic has truly exposed the absolute importance of a positive and open relationship between home and school. New ways of communicating during school closures has establishedstrengthened the foundation upon which these relationships can be nurtured into the future. To do so is to enhance the learning experiences of our children at home and in school.This list is by no means exhaustive, but it seeks to open up the conversation not only about the purpose of education, but about its value and importance within Irish society. In his recent address to sixth class pupils, President Michael D Higgins stated that “school is where we learn how to be part of a community and, most importantly, how to include others in that sense of community, by being kind and supportive and generous”.Rather than looking to schools and school leaders for the answer, maybe it is time for us to reach out in the community, in the spirit of the true Irish meitheal, and ask what can we do to help support schools and teachers as they now face into the difficult and challenging task of physically reopening their doors and classrooms in August. Coming together in this way can only help support a thriving and flourishing school community.In the words of my seven-year-old in an email to his teacher, “I’m really really really really excited about seeing you after this is all over”.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Government is to ask the Oireachtas to approve almost €2 billion in additional funding for the health service this week to deal with the Covid-19 emergency.The Government is also to look for authorisation for an increased allocation of €483 million for jobs and enterprise development.The revised spending authorisation, if approved by the Oireachtas, will see expenditure on health exceed €20 billion for the first time.However, further supplementary funding for the health service may be required later in the year, a report by the Parliamentary Budget Office in the Oireachtas has suggested. It is critical of a lack of detail from Government on how the additional funding will be spent.“The HSE generates its own income. If the pandemic reduces the income of the HSE in 2020 below what has been budgeted for, a supplementary estimate may be necessary on that basis alone.”Further funding could also be needed if there is a second surge in the number of coronavirus cases.The deferral of treatment for patients during the pandemic and the increase in waiting lists may result “in a significant knock-on effect on non-pandemic public healthcare spending later in 2020 and into 2021”, the report also warns.It suggests two significant components will be the roughly €320 million for personal protective equipment (PPE) and the estimated €115 million per month cost of taking over private hospitals to provide additional capacity during the peak of the pandemic.“The lack of any detail on pandemic-related spending beyond labelling three subheads is of some concern, in particular when considered alongside the absence of context and impact indicators and performance metrics related to the pandemic.”Overseas travelSeparately, as hairdressers, pubs serving food, churches and creches reopened yesterday, public health officials doubled down on their opposition to any loosening of overseas travel rules, with chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan saying holidaymakers should cancel their bookings.Asked whether people should cancel their summer holidays abroad, Dr Holohan urged them not to travel in their own inidual and the collective interest.No new deaths of patients with Covid-19 were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Monday but another 24 new confirmed cases of the disease were recorded. Nine of the cases involved people under 35, and six involved foreign travel.One cluster required testing for over 20 contacts of the original case, who had travelled to Iraq from the northwest.‘Worrying’ trendsDr Holohan said public health officials were beginning to see some “worrying” new trends, with the number of reported cases increasing and some new clusters.On the issue of travel restrictions and the potential to ease the two-week quarantine rules for those arriving from outside the island of Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said a “substantive decision will be taken on that” at a future Cabinet meeting.“We would look at European methodology around this in terms of a science-based approach,” he said.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said: “We can’t seal off the country.”“We are in a Common Travel Area with the UK, we have a Border with the North and there are still flights coming in at the moment. But we will have to manage the risk, which is the key thing here and it is a risk.“We are going to have to be very careful in terms of Covid as it flares up and act quickly in local areas,” Mr Ryan added. He said people should continue to restrict “travel to when it is absolutely necessary” and encouraged people to holiday domestically this summer rather than travel abroad. Gobally the Covid-19 pandemic is “actually speeding up” WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday.“We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over,” he said, adding “the worst is yet to come”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291993.1593461599!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mortgage seekers face tighter criteria over covid 19 wage subsidy","story":"Several Irish lenders have introduced tighter checks and stricter conditions on mortgages for those in receipt of Covid-era wage subsidies.In some instances, borrowers will have to produce evidence from their employers that their wage is sustainable after subsidies elapse. In couples where one person is on a wage subsidy, some lenders will insist the second partner is able to cover the entirety of the mortgage with their wage. It comes after The  revealed on Monday that AIB had put in place a de facto block on mortgage lending to those in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme (TWSS). Permanent TSB said customers on the wage subsidy scheme can draw down their loans “subject to their employers providing assurance on the sustainability of their income when the TWSS comes to an end”.Finance Ireland, a non-bank lender which is more than 30 per cent owned by the State, said “where an application has been materially affected by a Covid-related subsidy, loans cannot be drawn down until a return to regular income can be evidenced”. ‘Confirmation of income’A spokeswoman for Ulster Bank said it was accepting new mortgage applications where one or both applicants were on the wage subsidy scheme. However, it said it would require “confirmation of income and employment” before advancing to a loan offer. It is understood that Ulster Bank will insist that where one applicant in a couple is on a wage subsidy, the second applicant who is not must be able to cover the entire loan by themselves. Bank of Ireland said it was still lending to those in receipt of the subsidy. The bank said that while a number of applications had been “deferred”, “mortgages are drawing down daily for customers in receipt of the Government subsidy where overall sustainable affordability has been satisfied”. “Where income has changed, we are liaising with customers to understand their updated circumstances and assess if these are expected to change again in the future.” AIB’s policy drew criticism from both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on Monday. Michael McGrath said he was “not happy” about the development, and had previously “conveyed his opposition and concerns” to banking groups and the governor of the Central Bank. Asked about Mr McGrath’s comments, Micheál Martin said he “would agree with the Minister and I think that is something we will examine and look at . . . I wouldn’t be entirely happy with that approach,” he said. AIB has said its policies are kept under review, and that it is “imperative the mistakes of the past are not repeated”. Pearse Doherty, the Sinn Féin finance spokesman, said the AIB policy “will affect countless customers who have not lost their jobs, had their pay cut or hours reduced. This de-facto ban pays no heed to this reality.” Labour TD Ged Nash said he had made representations on behalf of several constituents who had paid deposits “only to have been threatened with withdrawal of their original mortgage offer on the basis they are being paid, for now, through the wage subsidy scheme”. A spokeswoman for the Central Bank said it expected all regulated firms to take “a consumer-focused approach and act in their customers’ best interests at all times”, but that the decision to grant or refuse applications is a commercial decision for banks alone. The Central Bank pointed to European Union regulations which provide that lenders have to make a thorough assessment of consumer creditworthiness before approving a loan. Earlier this month, Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf said the banking system had a role to play during the Covid-19 crisis and “it must do so in a sustainable way”.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Politics is a brutal business sometimes. Even when you’re on the winning side. Dara Calleary was expected by almost everyone – including himself, his supporters in Mayo and his friends in the parliamentary party – to be appointed to a senior post in Cabinet. That assumption, it turned out on Saturday afternoon, was incorrect.There was no warning of the let-down in advance. Calleary found out when he went in for his meeting with Micheál Martin in the hours after he became Taoiseach. It was, by all accounts, a difficult encounter, and Calleary left the building devastated. The news ran around the political class like wildfire.The humiliations of politics are painfully public, and after the initial shock Calleary has borne his with some fortitude and dignity. He acknowledged the hurt, but then resolved to move on. Don’t show your face in Mayo, one local party chief warned the Fianna Fáil leader.The ill-feeling in the west is real, if overdone. Pleading that your parishtowncountyregion is ignored by the government is so familiar a refrain in Irish politics it has become banal.The anger in the parliamentary party is real too, although much of it is jealousy at the elevation of blow-in Stephen Donnelly and new TD Norma Foley rather than camaraderie with Calleary. Few TDs would rather the deputy leader in the Cabinet than themselves. At a basic level politicians are all sole traders. The idea they are ready to march on the Taoiseach’s office to get a job for someone else is not one rooted in reality. Like all of these rows it will pass quickly enough. Lost their jobsMoreover, there are many people in and around politics who have lost their jobs in recent days – the Fine Gael Cabinet members (two of them from the westnorthwest region, remember), their advisers and drivers, staffers of all ranks – they have not just lost out on a promotion, they have become unemployed.It is also wise to keep in mind that for most of the public jobs for politicians is a topic in which they are profoundly disinterested. When the Junior Ministers are announced on Wednesday – a major event in political circles and a chance for Martin to calm the unrest – they will be just as uninterested.And yet it is hard to escape the conclusion that this was an avoidable stumble for Fianna Fáil. Cabinets nearly always try to observe some geographical spread. They do that for a reason. Martin decided it wasn’t important enough. Early days, and he is piling up the enemies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291995.1593461710!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dara calleary feelings in mayo run high over lack of cabinet role","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Chief Whip Dara Calleary  leaveing Dublin Castle following the Cabinet meeting. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillTaoiseach Micheál Martin and new Government Chief Whip Dara Calleary sought to put the controversy over Mr Calleary’s appointment behind them on Monday night, but local feelings in Mayo continued to run high, where one local party official told Mr Martin that he “need not show his nose in Mayo”.Speaking to journalists after the first full meeting of the Cabinet, Mr Martin sought to move on and signalled that the appointment of junior ministers on Wednesday would address the regional imbalance in the Cabinet.The Taoiseach said the position of chief whip would be extremely important in a “tripartite Government”, and also defended the regional balance of the Cabinet.“Dara Calleary is from the west, Hildegarde Naughton as well and we are a Government for the entire country and that is a very important point and that will remain the case, and part of the remit of the programme for government is regional development and trying to change direction so that we get a better balance of economic development.“That is not dependent on any one Minister. That is a collective responsibility of the entire Cabinet and will remain so.“There are further appointments to be made as well.”In a series of interviews, Mr Calleary acknowledged that he had been let down by Mr Martin’s failure to appoint him to a full Cabinet role, but resolved to do the whip’s job as best he could.“We had a very difficult conversation,” he told Midwest radio early on Monday. “I told him I was disappointed. I had hoped to lead a department, it had always been my ambition, and it remains my ambition today. It will happen, it will absolutely happen.“But I am going to take on the job I have been given, and I will be sitting at the Cabinet table. The chief whip has often been called the gatekeeper of Cabinet and I will be that gatekeeper, and I will be a gatekeeper for the west.”Mr Farrell told both Midwest radio and RTÉ radio’s News at One that the general consensus was that Mr Martin would not be welcome in Mayo while he is Taoiseach.Mr Farrell said he could not say why Mr Martin had appointed first-time TDs as Ministers while someone with the experience of Mr Calleary was overlooked.Not having someone from the west of Ireland in the Cabinet was “the old story again of to hell or Connacht”.Any time “anything was being handed out”, the west was always the last to be chosen, he added.“Rural Ireland is being neglected,” he said.The Government is due to meet again on Wednesday when it is expected to name the remaining 17 junior ministers three “super junior” ministers who sit at the Cabinet table having been named along with the Cabinet proper on Saturday.It is expected that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will have eight junior ministers in total, with the Greens having four, including their super juniors."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291947.1593457770!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"next ambassador to china takes up role at critical time for ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnn Derwin moves to Beijing at a critical time in relations between the countries when the supply of personal protective equipment from Chinese manufacturers is essential to the State’s fight against Covid-19 and as China becomes a more important trading partner and destination for exports.

Ms Derwin, who is currently assistant secretary general at the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been nominated to replace Eoin O’Leary as the State’s chief envoy in Beijing. The appointment is unusual in that Ms Derwin is not a career diplomat and this is her first overseas appointment as an ambassador after moving to the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2017 from the Department of Agriculture where she was assistant secretary.Ms Derwin has served overseas in the past she was agriculture attaché in Spain before returning to become chief economist at the Department of Agriculture. She was the first woman to be appointed to the management board of that department.Mr O’Leary is moving to Vienna to become ambassador to Austria at the end of his three-year stint in China. He is taking over from Tom Hanney who became Ireland’s permanent representative at the European Union in Brussels replacing veteran diplomat Declan Kelleher who retired in March. Ms Derwin will become the 10th envoy in Beijing since Ireland established diplomatic relations with China in 1979. She is the second woman to serve in the role. She moves to Beijing at a critical time in relations between the countries when the supply of personal protective equipment from Chinese manufacturers is essential to the State’s fight against Covid-19 and as China becomes a more important trading partner and destination for exports. Ms Derwin, who is originally from Sligo, has a masters in agricultural economics from Imperial College London and a doctorate in governance at Queen’s University Belfast. In her current role at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ms Derwin is in charge of the global Irish services ision, overseeing the department’s diaspora, consular and passport services.Her appointment is being made as part of a routine round of new diplomatic assignments to be officially announced shortly.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Washington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291905.1593457074!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pandemic is speeding up and is not even close to being over who says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation: ‘We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives.’ Photograph: Salvatore Di NolfiEPATracing contacts of people with coronavirus infections is the most important step in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, and countries that are failing to do so have no excuse, the World Health Organisation chief said on Monday.“Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing.“We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over,” he said. “Most people remain susceptible, the virus still has a lot of room to move.”Countries such as South Korea had managed to contain the disease by tracking down the contacts of those carrying infection, Dr Tedros said. This was possible even under extreme conditions, as the WHO itself had shown by halting an outbreak of Ebola in eastern Congo, tracing 25,000 contacts a day in a remote area where some 20 armed groups were fighting, he added.“No excuse for contact tracing. If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse.”OriginsIn a move sought by the WHO’s biggest critic, the United States, Dr Tedros announced that a team would be sent to China next week to investigate the origins of the outbreak.“We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started,” Dr Tedros said. “We will be sending a team next week to China to prepare for that.”US president Donald Trump and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have both said the disease could have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although they have presented no evidence of this, and China denies it. Scientists say the virus emerged in nature.Mr Trump has announced plans to quit the WHO, which he says is too close to China. He has repeatedly emphasised the Chinese origins of the virus, calling it “Kung Flu” at two rallies this month, a term the White House had previously described as unacceptable and which Asian-American groups say is racist.‘Mutual respect’Asked about Mr Trump’s use of the term, the director of the WHO’s emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, called for an “international discourse that is based on mutual respect”.“Many people around the world have used unfortunate language in this response,” he said.Mr Ryan said there had been tremendous progress towards finding a vaccine, but there was no guarantee of success. In the meantime countries must use the strategies available, such as social distancing and contact tracing.“Many, many countries through applying a comprehensive strategy have reached a very low level of virus transmission in their countries but always have to remain vigilant in case there are clusters or small outbreaks.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the

lockdown in leicester","story":"The UK government will change the law to enforce the local lockdown in Leicester, health secretary Matt Hancock has said.Speaking to Sky News on Monday morning, he said: “We will be bringing forward a legal change very shortly, in the next couple of days, because some of the measures that we’ve unfortunately had to take in Leicester will require legal underpinning.”Mr Hancock said “in some cases” the lockdown would be enforced by the police, while legal changes would be made so non-essential retail is no longer open.When pressed on how people would be stopped from travelling outside the city, he said: “We’re recommending against all but essential travel both to and from and within Leicester, and as we saw during the peak, the vast majority of people will abide by these rules.“Of course we will take further action including putting in place laws if that is necessary but I very much hope it won’t be.”The city of Leicester must go back into a stricter lockdown because its Covid-19 infection rate was much higher than anywhere else in the country, Mr Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday.Non-essential shops in Leicester will close from Tuesday and schools will close to most pupils from Thursday as part of restrictions imposed after a rise in cases, Mr Hancock told MPs.He said the easing of the lockdown planned for the rest of England on July 4th cannot happen in Leicester because of rising cases.He said: “Given the growing outbreak in Leicester we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown set to take place on July 4th happens in Leicester.”This means pubs, hairdressers and restaurants will not be able to open this week.The health secretary said Leicester accounted for about 10 per cent of all positive cases in the UK over the past week, and that the seven-day infection rate there was 135 cases per 100,000 people, three times higher than the next highest city.Mr Hancock advised people from Leicester to stay at home as much as they can while the local lockdown measures continue.He told MPs: “Having taken clinical advice on the actions necessary and discussed them with the local team in Leicester and Leicestershire, we have made some difficult but important decisions.“We’ve decided that from tomorrow, non-essential retail will have to close and as children have been particularly impacted by this outbreak, schools will also need to close from Thursday, staying open for vulnerable children and children of critical workers as they did throughout.“Unfortunately, the clinical advice is that the relaxation of shielding measures due on July 6th cannot now take place in Leicester.“We recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester.“We’ll monitor closely adhering to social distancing rules and we’ll take further steps if that is what’s necessary.”He said the measures would be kept under review and would not be kept in place “any longer than is necessary”, adding: “We’ll review if we can release any of the measures in two weeks.“These Leicester-specific measures will apply not just to the city of Leicester but also the surrounding conurbation including, for example, Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield.“I know that this is a worrying time for people living in Leicester and I want you to know you have our full support.“We do not take these decisions lightly but with the interests of the people of Leicester in our hearts.”Mr Hancock announced further measures in Leicester to help tackle the outbreak, including the setting up of a walk-in testing centre for those with coronavirus symptoms.He said: “Anyone in Leicester with symptoms must come forward for a test.” –

nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"air bridge plan jeopardy greece suspends holiday flights uk","story":"Britain’s air bridge plans are in danger of being undermined as Greece banned British holiday flights until the middle of July.Greece announced it was suspending all direct flights from the UK and Sweden until July 15 because of the epidemiological data on the state of the Coronavirus pandemic in both countries.Ireland also signalled that Britain is unlikely to be on its “green list” of countries under which travellers will be exempted from its 14-day quarantine from July 9 because of the UK’s “very high” incidence of Coronavirus.And Nicola Sturgeon warned she will consider introducing quarantine for English visitors to Scotland if the number of coronavirus cases south of the Border surges. She said she had no plans at present for restrictions on cross-Border travel but added: I\u0027m not ruling anything out.The moves come just days before Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is due to unveil a list of more than 50 countries where he plans air bridges to allow British holidaymakers to avoid having to self-isolate for 14 days on their return.Greece along with France and Spain was named by the Government last Friday as one of the chosen 50 destinations earmarked for quarantine-free holidays from July 6. The number of searches for Greek holidays trebled as a result over the weekend.However, announcing plans to open the country to international travellers from July 1, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis specifically excluded flights from Britain and Sweden, scuppering holiday plans.The whole opening process is ongoing and the data will be constantly evaluated, he said.Travel firms warned it added to the confusion and uncertainty for families seeking to plan foreign holidays, while one Conservative MP said it “drove a coach and horses” through the Government’s quarantine policy.Ireland is expected to announce its “green list” of countries on July 9 which is understood to include Spain, Greece, Portugal, Malta and Croatia.However, the Irish taoiseach Leo Veradkar warned that if the decision was made now, travellers from Britain with its “very high incidences of infection” would still face quarantine - even though Irish people travelling from the republic to the UK do not have self-isolate.Dr Tony Holohan, Ireland’s chief medical officer, said its green list would be countries with similarly low infection rates. Ireland had two cases on Sunday compared with the UK’s 900. We are beyond nervous. We are concerned about travel as a potential source of infection for this country,” he said.Denmark has also unexpectedly kept the UK, Ireland, Romania and Malta on its “quarantine” list of countries, in retaliation for their own restrictions.  By contrast, the Czech republic announced yesterday that Britain would be on a green list exempting visitors from quarantine. However, it banned Sweden on “red” and put Portugal on “amber. Britain is also threatening to exclude Portugal from its air bridges after an outbreak of Coronavirus in and around Lisbon that has forced a new lockdown in 19 parishes.  Rowland Paterson, executive director of the Ultimate Travel Company, said the holiday landscape was changing “almost by the hour” as he warned people against booking prematurely.He said Greece appeared to be as guilty as the UK of making policy on the hoof. He added: Until there is agreement and something in writing, it would be precipitous or too risky for people to book a holiday to one of these countries.”Henry Smith, the Conservative chair of the cross-party Future of Aviation Group, said the Greek decision “drives a coach and horses through the quarantine. That is disappointing. I think it is a retrograde step but a country needs to do what they think is in their public health interests.”Paul Charles, chief executive of PC Consultancy, which specialises in travel advice, said: “Greece is signalling they want to be certain there is little to no risk letting UK travellers in. By giving it another two weeks, they are buying time to help the British prove that Covid is completely under control.”It has also emerged that a British couple have become the first people to be fined £100 under the quarantine laws for refusing to fill in their locator forms when they were stopped at Coquelles in France. The pair will be referred to police to ensure they self-isolate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chinese scientists discover new swine flu capable triggering","story":"Researchers in China have discovered a new type of swine flu that is capable of triggering a pandemic, according to a study published on Monday in the US science journal PNAS.Named G4, it is genetically descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009.It possesses all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans, say the authors, scientists at Chinese universities and China\u0027s Center for Disease Control and Prevention.From 2011 to 2018, researchers took 30,000 nasal swabs from pigs in slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces and in a veterinary hospital, allowing them to isolate 179 swine flu viruses.The majority were of a new kind which has been dominant among pigs since 2016.The researchers then carried out various experiments including on ferrets, which are widely used in flu studies because they experience similar symptoms to humans - principally fever, coughing and sneezing.G4 was observed to be highly infectious, replicating in human cells and causing more serious symptoms in ferrets than other viruses.Tests also showed that any immunity humans gain from exposure to seasonal flu does not provide protection from G4.According to blood tests which showed up antibodies created by exposure to the virus, 10.4 per cent of swine workers had already been infected.The tests showed that as many as 4.4 per cent of the general population also appeared to have been exposed.The virus has therefore already passed from animals to humans but there is no evidence yet that it can be passed from human to human - the scientists\u0027 main worry.It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic, the researchers wrote.The authors called for urgent measures to monitor people working with pigs.The work comes as a salutary reminder that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of zoonotic pathogens and that farmed animals, with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife, may act as the source for important pandemic viruses, said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University.A zoonotic infection is caused by a pathogen that has jumped from a non-human animal into a human.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cate blanchett yearns bygone age women didnt yell","story":"Cate Blanchett has claimed that women have lost the art of civilised public debate and are instead resorting to haranguing matches and shouting.The Oscar-winning actress who takes the part of conservative ­author Phyllis Schlafly in the new TV drama Mrs America said she ­admired the way women would speak in the Seventies.There was a real strong ­culture of robust public debate and I feel like that is something we\u0027ve lost, not just in America but globally, she told ­Radio Times.We\u0027ve got haranguing matches and shouting but we haven\u0027t got a sense of public ­discourse -

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Britons are expected to spend £210 million in pubs this weekend as more than one third return to their local. About 35 per cent of UK adults plan to visit a pub in the first week they reopen after the coronavirus lockdown, new research by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) predicts. A “substantial proportion” of these are intending to go during the initial weekend in what is expected to be a major boost for the sector’s hopes of rapid recovery, the think tank said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCEBR expects about 6.5 million pub trips to be made this weekend, which is about 1.5 million more than would be the case on a normal weekend. However, it stressed that a majority of the population “remains cautious” over a return to bars and pubs.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThe rush to get back to the pub after more than three months stuck at home is expected to result in a jump in consumer spending, with spending expected to increase by 32 per cent over the weekend, it said. The CEBR report added: “The longer-term outlook for the pub industry may not be so rosy, however. “Many within the wider hospitality industry had warned that the need for two-metre social distancing rendered a majority of businesses unviable. “Though the replacement of this rule with a new “one-metre plus” recommendation means that many more pubs will now be able to return to operation, it still represents a considerable restriction for others.” The think tank also estimates average profits for those which reopen to be about 46 per cent of pre-crisis levels, as dwindling sales are eaten up by cost rises.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.British hunters have killed at least 60 lions – and probably more – since the shooting of Cecil in 2015, as a promised government ban on trophy imports has been delayed again.Official figures reveal dozens of bodies, skins and other parts of the endangered animal have been brought into the UK from Africa in the past five years.The data also show the European Union imports more lion trophies than any country, allowing the species to be driven dangerously towards extinction, experts say.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAfter the killing – exactly five years ago – of Cecil in Zimbabwe by a US dentist prompted an international outcry, ministers promised to ban imports of lion trophies by 2017. The promise was also included in last year’s Tory election manifesto, and in February, Boris Johnson told Parliament he would deliver a ban.Numbers of wild lions have tumbled from about 450,000 in the 1950s to 20,000 in 2015 to an estimated 15,000 now. It’s feared there could be as few as 13,000.

Conservationists have described the decline as “heartbreaking”.Ministers last year announced a public consultation on a ban, which ended in February, but officials say the outcome has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.The consultation included the option of stricter requirements or a ban on parts of only certain species.But analysis of numbers from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which regulates trade, reveals lion bodies, as well as skins, skulls, claws and feet, have been legally brought into the UK. A conservative reading of the database suggests that represents between 53 and 77 dead lions.But if the body parts were listed not as trophies but for personal, educational or commercial trade, the number of imports to the UK is 154.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Then it changed its mind. As a result, British hunters shot another 50 or more ‘Cecils’.“Now it’s saying again that it wants to ban hunting trophies. We cannot have any more dithering or delay. Nine out of 10 voters want this stopped.Lions cubs found at squalid breeding centre too sick to walk“Wildlife is on the brink. There is now a real prospect of lions becoming extinct in the wild.”Other Cites data reveal the EU is the world’s largest importer of lion trophies compared with non-EU countries. The EU imported 406 lion trophies in 2017 and 2018, including 18 trophies of wild lions in Zimbabwe like Cecil.Within the EU, Spain imported the most lion trophies – 84 – in the two years.Claire Bass, Humane Society InternationalUK’s executive director, said: “Cecil’s senseless killing exposed trophy hunting as immensely cruel, completely unnecessary and morally bankrupt. And yet, five years on from his tragic death, Britain and the European Union are still providing a market for this horrific hobby.”Killing of Cecil the lion encourages UK hunters to kill more big catsThe public were outraged when Walter Palmer shot Cecil, a protected lion and one of Zimbabwe’s most loved animals, on 1 July 2015. It led to calls for his extradition to Zimbabwe, and he became the target of threats and protests. A professional hunter was cleared over the death.In answer to MPs who have questioned the delay, minister Victoria Prentis said the government was continuing to work on the issue and would publish its response as soon as it was practical. “The outcome of the consultation, and the accompanying call for evidence, will inform our next steps,” she added.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “There is a clear manifesto commitment to ban the import of hunting trophies from endangered animals and we continue to work to end this shocking trade.”The Independent has also asked the European Commission to comment.Cecil the lion\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We have been on it.”The emergency crackdown in Leicester follows the revelation that one in 10 new infections nationwide are happening in the cityNon-essential shops will shut and remain closed for the foreseeable future, most schools will be closed from Thursday and plans to relax shielding measures for the most vulnerable have been shelved.With the city’s pubs, bars and restaurants no longer permitted to reopen this weekend, there are fears of people flocking to nearby Derby and Nottingham, for example.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSchools could also be warned that they may have to concentrate on allowing pupils to catch up in subjects like maths and English after lockdown, and a full curriculum may not be available until next year’s summer term.Some pupils could also have to drop some GSCE subjects altogether to allow them to achieve better grades in “core subjects”.The guidance is expected to be set out by Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, later this week. Mr Williamson is under intense pressure to have all children in England back in school by September, after the government was forced to U-turn on plans to have them in the classroom before the end of the summer term. The proposals were first reported by the HuffPost website. It is thought schools will also be told they have to continue to engage with the NHS Test and Trace system, and that whole classes or year groups could be sent home if a pupil tests positive for Covid-19. Ministers are understood to believe that parents have got used to the idea of smaller “bubbles” in schools and that the idea can be scaled up to help all pupils return to school in September.  Around 1.5 million pupils are currently in school, after ministers announced that some year groups could return.

Teachers would also be advised to remain 2 metres away from pupils, not spend more than 15 minutes with each pupil,  but not wear face coverings, because they interfere with teaching. The site also reported that children would be told to face the same direction, not sit at circular tables. At the weekend Boris Johnson confirmed he wanted it to be compulsory again from September to send children to school. Many parents have so far decided not to send their kids to school, amid fears over the spread of the disease.It is understood the proposals seen by HuffPost were a form of draft. The final guidance will be released later this week, sources said. Experts warn that many children are falling behind after weeks out of the classroom. There are also concerns about how the economy will cope if parents continue to have to juggle their day job with full time care of children. Mr Williamson told LBC that fines were one option for parents whose children do not return to school.“Unless there is a good reason for the absence then we will be looking at the fact that we would be imposing fines on families if they are not sending their children back,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

At the same time, beaches in Fort Lauderdale and Broward County will be closed between Friday 3 July and Sunday 5 July, said mayor Dean Trantalis on Sunday.“The reason why we’re doing this is because we feel that we will not be able to provide the necessary safe environment that everyone is entitled to enjoy when they come to our beaches,” said Mr Trantalis.“Our businesses will remain open -- all the restaurants, all the T-shirt shops, all the retail shops -- everything will be open,” he continued. “But, unfortunately, because we normally anticipate large crowds, perhaps even coming from other counties, that we made this decision to move forward.”Still, crowds lambasted Broward County authorities who made that announcement, with some shouting slogans such as “Freedom” and “This is America”, said CNN.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson has said a deal could even be reached this month with new momentum.He spoke with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month.This latest round of talks will continue all week, with Mr Frost and Mr Barnier expected to meet this Friday.Follow our Brexit live blog below for all the latest updates… This week is just the first of six rounds of talks, each of which will take a week.Therell be five between now and the end of July, with the final round scheduled for August .Top items on the agenda include: David Frost’s promotion to be the PM’s top security adviser has raised hopes of a swt Brexit deal.Brussels sources called it “encouraging” that Mr Frost will stay on as Britain’s chief negotiator until talks end.Eurocrats think he won’t want discussions to end in failure at the same time as he takes on the key role overseeing terror threats.A diplomatic source told The Sun: “Frost must now more than ever be a man in a hurry.#Failure would be a very poor look.”Boris Johnson appointed Mr Frost to take over as National Security Adviser from top civil servant Sir Mark Sedwill.He will take up the job in late August but insists the trade talks remain his “top single priority”.Two senior Tory MPs are trying to force the Government to automatically grant EU children in case settled status in the UK once freedom of movement ends.Former minister Tim Loughton is leading a cross-party effort to #avoid the risk of another Windrush scandal# with an amendment to legislation that could be debated today.Joined by Tory former cabinet member Andrew Mitchell and senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, it hopes to give the children automatic and indefinite leave to remain under the EU settlement scheme. The Government has awarded protection to farmers amid fears they could be undercut as trade deals are hashed out in Brussels.International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said free trade agreements with countries including the US “must be fair and reciprocal”.She added Britain will maintain EU bans on goods including chlorinated chicken amid fears farmers could be hurt by cheaper imports.Ms Truss continued the commission will ensure farmers “do not face unfair competition and that their high animal welfare and production standards are not undermined”.Boris Johnson’s spokesman has said Brexit negotiations need to end #by the autumn#.He added the role of David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, will “cease to exist” later this year..He said Mr Frost’s role will be dissolved once talks end. He said: #We have been clear on a number of occasions that these talks shouldnt drag and that want and need them to concluded by the autumn.“He is taking up his role around the end of August. There will be a short transition period sothere is a small overlap with the Brexit negotiations that is possible.”The Government has hinted the end of September will be the deadline for Brexit trade talks.Fresh discussion kicked off today.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the UK had been “very clear” with the EU that the talks needed to be completed sooner rather than later.Brexiteer Mark Francios has urged Michel Barnier to listen to Boris Johnson’s demands amid today’s fresh talks.He wrote: “I refer you to the Conservative Party’s  Manesto # which I and all my colleagues stood on late last year # which made clear to the British people that we would have ‘a new relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation, not on the EU’s Treaties or EU laws’”.“In the spirit of honesty between friends,” he added, “there can be no way that the European Court of Justice can be allowed to have any role in the UK’s national le after the end of this year.”A US trade expert has claimed the EU is “exaggerating” fears in order to keep Britain tethered to its regulations, according to a US trade expert.In a recent podcast by the CATO institute, US trade expert Simon Lester said: #The EU is expressing concerns about the UK deregulating or offering new subsidies in a way that gives them an unfair advantage and they want rules to deal with that.#I think the Europeans are exaggerating those fears a bit.#The problem in the negotiations seems to be that the way the Europeans are presenting it is really putting the Brits off.#They are reaching badly to this, so each side is going through this routine of political attacks.#It sets a bad tone and it leads to distrust.”The EU have shown some flexibility on the issue of fisheries, EuroNews reports.Brexit was hailed across fishing communities as a #golden opportunity# to re-energise British fishermen thanks to the expiration of the controversial Common Fisheries Policyback in December.“Some of the EUs unrealistic positions will have to changewe are to move forward,# the UKs chief negotiator David Frost said in a tweet posted last week. #UK sovereignty, over our laws, our courts, or our fishing waters, is of course not up for discussion. Equally we do not seek anything which would undermine the integrity of the EUs single market.#Michel Barnier has said the EU is “calm and united” as Brexit talks resume. He added they would “make the most” of the intensied process, according to London Glossy.The new Brexit talks are underway in a bid to “speed up and intensy negotiations,” according to The Economist Espresso. The Economist Espresso is a morning briefing from the editors of The Economist.The post adds: “The risk of there being no trade deal in place on January st, meaning reverting to normal World Trade Organisation rules, remains high.”Sir Mark Sedwilll announced last night he will be stepping down from his role as Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, with David Frost picking up the latter role.The prime minister’s spokesman said Frost would not be replaced as chief Brexit negotiator, however.The spokesman added Mr Frost will continue in his role alongside theNational Security Adviser job.But with the new job starting in September, the Brexit negotiator is cutting it fine # and could end up juggling both roles. But No  backed Mr Frost, calling him a “serious diplomat, policy thinker and negotiator”.The British pound has dropped in value as fresh Brexit talks began today, with David Frost and Michel Barnier meeting face-to-face for the first time. GBP EUR was down by  pips, following a -. per centfall in the pound-euro exchange rate last week.The currency also saw fresh three-month lows, owing to concerns about the state of Brexit negotiations.And the pound-euro exchange rate continues to fall, after falling for seven of the past eight weeks.Tory Brexiteers have sought to increase pressure on Brussels by indicating their support for Mr Frost and demanding that Mr Barnier drops the EUs #unreasonable demands#.A letter to Mr Barnier from European Research Groupchairman Mark Francois said there could be #no way# for the European Court of Justice to have any role in the UK after this year and the UK must also have #full control# of fishing waters.The ERG told Mr Barnier: #If you and your team are willing to accept that the United Kingdom will be a fully independent country at the end of this year, responsible for its own destiny but willing to trade equitably with its neighbours, I can see no reason why we wont be able to raty a free trade deal with time to spare.#The current transition period expires at the end of the year, meaning new arrangements will need to be in place by January  or the UK will follow World Trade Organisation rules for its relationship with the EU.European Union diplomats have criticised the UK’s chief negotiator for accepting a new job as National Security Adviser before the Brexit trade deal was finished, thereports.#Barnier didn’t run for commission president to deliver Brexit, but doing that isn’t enough for Frost apparently,” one EU diplomat told the paper.#Is there such a shortage of people in the UK that they had to pick the chief negotiator # Negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted this picture as talks get under way face-to-face for the first time since the pandemic began. Participants are sitting well away from each other # but no one is wearing a mask.Farming leaders have welcomed the Governments pledge to set up an independent trade and agriculture commission amid calls to protect UK food standards.The National Farmers Unionhas been calling for an independent commission which reviews trade policy and makes sure that all food imports are held to the same standards expected of British farmers.The organisations call comes amid ongoing fears that post-Brexit trade deals could undermine the UKs food, animal welfare and environmental standards.Organisations from the NFU to conservation groups have warned against allowing imports of food that would be illegal to produce here, with fears that farmers and standards could be undermined by products such as chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef.Boris Johnson was asked about the negative briefing against Sir Mark Sedwill this morning # which weve detailed in the previous post.In his Times Radio interview, the PM said: #Look, I try not to read too much of the negative briefing. #There’s an awful lot of stuff that comes out in the papers to which # I wouldn’t automatically attach the utmost credence.#But when he was asked directly to confirm that the negative briefing did not come directly from his office, Johnson said he didnt know exactly which briefing the presenter was referring to. If youre looking for more information about Sir Mark and whats happening, youll find a full explainer here.In an article for the , Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, says outgoing Cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill and other senior civil servants have been the victims of “cowardly” hostile briefings condoned by the Prime Minister. He said: #For those who watch these things, the departure of Sir Mark Sedwill as cabinet secretary and chief security adviser followed a now familiar and depressing pattern.#Weeks of anonymous hostile briefing to the newspapers, suggesting a rt between the country’s most senior civil servant and No staff over the handling of coronavirus, had risen to a crescendo, ending with a hastily arranged statement.#And hes labelled #anonymous briefings to the media# as #cowardly, unfair and undermining#.This week is one of six rounds of week-long talks.Therell be five between now and the end of July, with the final round scheduled for August . On the agenda are governance, fisheries, level playing field, trade in goods, trade in services, criminal law and judicial cooperation, energy and transport, participation in EU programmes such as science research, and continued mobility of social benefits for EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in the EU. Talks between the EU and the UK began today with a two-hour, face-to-face meeting between David Frost, the chief UK negotiator, and the EU’s Michel Barnier. The big dferences between the two are fisheries, fair competition in trade, governance and security.Despite that, theres still hope of a deal after resumed meetings, which # it is hoped # will allow for more nuanced discussions.Weve blogged quite a bit from that Downing Street media briefing this lunchtime.Officials used the press conference to effectively set the end of September as a deadline for the post-Brexit trade talks with the EU.Boris Johnsons spokesman said: #Weve always been very clear that talks cant go on into the autumn.#We need to make progress as soon as possible.#Pressed further, the official said: #We have spoken in the past about not wanting to be continuing having talks in September.Mr Johnson says he wants talks done by the end of July.Image: APDowning Street has defended the appointment of Boris Johnson chief EU negotiator to the key post of National Security Adviser .The Prime Minister faced criticism that unlike previous holders of the post, David Frost is a political adviser rather than a career civil servant, and lacks security experience.He will replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who is also stepping down as Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service, amid reports of clashes with Mr Johnsons chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.Downing Street has insisted such appointments were not unusual in other countries and that Mr Frost # who has the status of an ambassador # had spent  years as a diplomat in the Foreign Office before leaving in .#The appointment of the NSA is always a decision for the Prime Minister,# the Prime Ministers official spokesman said.No has also said this lunchtime that Brexit talks must be over #sooner rather than later#.Boris Johnsons spokesman said: #We have been very clear with the EU that the talks need to be concluded sooner rather than later.#We need to make sure businesses can prepare properly for what will happen at the end of the year. #If the negotiations go on too long, into the autumn, then they will not know what to prepare for.# Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the guidelines are not legally enforceable.Government insiders confirmed that this applied to fathers walking their daughters down the aisle.They said it will be up to inidual venues as to whether there is enough room to accommodate this.The source said: We would recommend people keep one-metre plus apart wherever possible. Social distancing should be adhered to.Laying out the strict rules for exchanging the rings, the document states: Where the exchanging of rings is required or desired for the solemnisation of the marriage or the formation of the civil partnership, hands should be washed before and after.The rings should be handled by as few people as possible.And on music it says: People should avoid singing, shouting, raising voices and or playing music at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult or that may encourage shouting. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission from aerosol and droplets.  But many couples may have to wait until September to tie the knot because some councils are delaying ceremonies until the autumn to give venues time to adjust to social distancing requirements.County councils that oversee registrar services told the Dailythat they could have to wait even longer than September.Oxford county council said it would only begin a phased approach to reopening wedding venues from September .And Somerset county council have demanded all venues fill out a risk assessment before any bookings take place - delaying weddings in the country for weeks at least.  Meanwhile, places of worship will be able to hold services for more than  people, but social distancing guidelines should be adhered to.Hymn books should be quarantined for  hours after use, while worshippers will be advised to take their own religious texts or prayer mats.Donations should be collected via contactless devices or online, where possible, or cash should be placed in a receptacle that is set in one place and not passed around.Where food and drink is essential to the act of worship, it will be permitted, but the sharing of food should be avoided - as well as the use of communal vessels.Those giving and receiving food should wash their hands before and after consumption, or wear gloves, according to the guidance.Singing, chanting, shouting and the playing of wind instruments should also be avoided because of the potential for increased risk of Covid- transmission from aerosol and droplets.Organs can be played for faith practices, but music should be at a volume that does not require worshippers to raise their voices.Lecycle events such as baptisms and bar mitzvahs should also have no more than  people present, unless the event is part of a routine communal worship service.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Local action like this is an important tool in our armoury to deal with outbreaks while we get the country back on its feet.As well as Leicester, other towns in the north of England are reported to be causing concern for health officials, including Barnsley, Rochdale and Oldham.The outbreak has seen dozens of fresh cases admitted to the area’s hospitals and Leicester City Council said there have been  confirmed infections in the city in the past two weeks.If further action is needed in Leicester or around the country – we will take itnecessary,” Mr Hancock told the Commons.Labours shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth backed the local lockdown.“The virus remains deadly, it causes signicant long-term harm and still demands a resolute response, he told MPs.If that means restrictions have to remain in place, whether in Leicester or where, orrestrictions have to be reimposed, whether in Leicester or where, then so be it.”Testers have swooped on Leicester to help track the citys spread - with members of the military ramping up tests in mobile units at Spinney Hill Park and Evington Leisure Centre.Thousands of home testing kits are also being made available.Health chiefs hope to control the flare-up by identying as many cases as possible and tracing their contacts, so they can be told to isolate.Sun Online can reveal the coronavirus outbreak is thought to have first emerged in the east of the city centre.Ethically Sourced Products in Spinney Hills, which makes designer Fred Perry polo shirts, has had five positive cases of Covid- out of a -strong workforce.An ex-worker of Ethically Sourced Products, who quit the company earlier this month, said: I’m not surprised by this outbreak.Managing Director Richard Olley declined to comment when approached by The Sun Online. Locals said they believed the outbreak is centred around the North Evington and Highfields areas, in the north east of the city.Others were reported at a sandwich factory and a Sainsbury’s supermarket — and five schools have closed.Officials are also worried about the city’s food production sites and multi-generational households.There had been speculation throughout yesterday that Leicester would be placed in lockdown after the citys Labour Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby expressed his anger after being told by Whitehall officials.He accused the Government of picking on the city and claimed a situation report was superficial and inaccurate.“If the virus is out of control or is spreading with the restrictions, I can’t see how extending them for a further two weeks would make any dference to that, he said.After Mr Hancocks announcement he sounded a more conciliatory tone saying: These measures are stricter than we anticipated but we understand the need for firm action. I am determined that we will make this work and to minimise the time these additional measures need to be in place in the city.From Saturday, England is opening up pubs, restaurants and hairdressers as part of Boris Johnsons plans to unlock the country but any glimmer of hope for locals in Leicester has been quashed.Businesses affected expressed their anger and disappointment about the decision to extend the lockdown.Hairdresser Sandra May, , owner of DJ’s Groom Room  Sandra May’s Hair Studio, said: “I am absolutely furious and devastated.“I’ve had so many calls from customers wanting to know what’s happening. We’re fully booked and they’ve just dropped us right in it.“We’d taken the precautions with PPE and planned training for the staff, we were even doing our own track and tracing, we’ve sterilised everything - it’s cost a fortune.“I’ve been following the rules but I’m opening on July  regardless. I’ve told all my clients.“If they want to arrest all the hairdressers in Leicester they’ll have some prisoners with great hair.”Alex Hylton, , licensee of the Salmon pub, said: “I’m absolutely gutted about lockdown being extended.“If we have to stay shut to help the city recover, I completely respect that. But I can’t see there will be any support from the local or national government.“This year would’ve been a great year for the pub with the Euros, Leicester in the Champions League and a massive Kasabian gig down the road. We would have sold loads of beer over the summer.”Meanwhile a local politician has said language barriers among the citys large Asian community could be one possible factor behind the recent spike.City councillor Ratilal Govind told MailOnline that he thought there had been a lack of communication with people who do not speak English as a first language in the city.Councillor Govind, who represents the city’s Evington ward where one of the four mobile testing stations for the virus has been sited, said: I have seen young people getting together, having a few drinks and conversation.“They are just social gatherings. With these young people there is a language barrier. They are speaking their own language and I tell them to disperse in Gujarati.“There is a lack of communication made worse by the language barriers.”Speaking of the surge in new cases on a visit to a construction site in West London on Monday morning, the PM said: We are concerned about Leicester, we are concerned about any local outbreak.I want to stress to people that we are not out of the woods yet. We are making these cautious, calibrated steps, we are opening as much of hospitality as we can on July , opening as much of the economy as we can - some things, alas, still remain closed until they can become Covid-secure.The UKs coronavirus death toll has risen to , after  more deaths were confirmed today.Sir Peter Soulsby said he will need to be convinced into keeping pubs and restaurants shut in Leicester - as a fresh spike in coronavirus cases blasts the area.He was left furious this morning after Public Health Englandsent him a report of the situation overnight.According to Sir Peter, the reports recommendations are about extending the restrictions for a further two weeks, but what we still dont have - whether its lockdown or restrictions - is why on earth you would do it and why you would do it here in Leicester.The fuming mayor said the report had been cobbled together and readily acknowledges that cases are higher in Leicester due to higher levels of testing in the city.He told the BBC: Ive looked at this report and, frankly, its obviously been cobbled together very hastily.Its superficial and its description of Leicester is inaccurate and certainly it does not provide us with the information we needwe are to remain restricted for two weeks longer than the rest of the country.He added that the local whack-a-mole strategy had worked in Weston-super-Mare and where there had been outbreaks around GP surgeries in London.Thats the same approach that we will bring to bear in Leicester as well.  The PMs comments come after the Government was warned this week that imposing local lockdowns could lead to signicant disorder.But some MPs, including Labour MP for Leicester East, Claudia Webbe, believe they may be necessary.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Webbe said: I’m very concerned, and I really do believe that where the data allows we need to ensure that we engage in processes to protect lives, and I think we need to go into therefore more localised lockdown to protect lives and ensure that we can address this virus.“The Government hasn’t reassured us. Thus far, the messages and the communication from the Government have been unclear, and it has been dficult, and I really don’t understand what communities are meant to follow.”The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledged the city was an area of concern as it urged residents to be vigilant against the virus.Anyone with symptoms should get a test as soon as possible, they stressed.  Sage documents recently revealed that local lockdowns could see violence and social unrest erupt.In papers released at the end of May, the Security sub-group, which feeds into the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned that imposing local lockdowns would not be suitable for implementation in the UK.Experts from Keele University warned it could undermine the consensus that has been built on the need for restrictive measures and lead to signicant issues of disorder.They added: The measures as proposed would entail the use of state power in an unprecedented way that could be perceived as discriminatory. A consensus has evolved in the UK over the last weeks concerning the need for restrictive measures which suggests that support for restrictive measures is contingent upon a sense of equality of sacrice . The proposed scheme undermines this core proposition.They added: Anger arising from communities who perceived they have been locked down unfairly would be directed at police in the majority of cases.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not the case.And make no mistake the prime minister’s shake-up at Westminster is good news.The chances of a post-Brexit economic revolution have now greatly improved.Michael Gove was exactly right in his major speech over the weekend where he challenged “group think” from the “metropolitan” elite in the civil service who have become “estranged” from ordinary folk.Nowhere was that more clear than the way the civil service tried every step of the way to stop Brexit happening at all. If Theresa May had stayed PM, they probably would have succeeded.As the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster put it, every arm of government seemed estranged from the majority”.We can’t forget that.Referring to the nd US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gove added: “FDR asked his Government to remember the Forgotten Man. In the  referendum those who had been too often forgotten asked to be remembered.”This is a government which, thank God, is not forgetting the people who just elected them in a landslide in December.This is a Prime Minister who, against all odds, does not let the London liberal media elite bully him into sacking his most important advisers or talk him out of sticking to his untrendy policies.I back his complete overhaul of the civil service – including the hiring of Brexiteers in senior roles – for that reason.He has five years to level up the inequalities in our country.It’s crucial every part of government is on board with that mission, which was so overwhelmingly backed by the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cant understand how mothers and fathers leave their children at home with some caregivers.Pictures show the man holding the girl firmly on his shoulders, before Zoran convinces him to take the child back to the playground.As they were walking back towards the playground, Zoran asked the suspect: Why did you take the child with you The suspected kidnapper said: “I think children are simply the most important thing. Children are our future, arent they ”When they arrived at the playground in the park, he asked the girl on his shoulders: Is your mum here in the park He added: All right, thats where were going, right  Were going to mum, right  You sit up there. You have to look for where she is. You have the best view, OK  Wheres mum  Oh, damn, a lot of people.

At the time, the conditions for issuing an arrest warrant were not met, which is why he had to be released.The police forwarded the investigation to those responsible for child offences on suspicion of kidnapping. They found that there was no evidence that he was a paedophile.They determined that the suspect had a permanent residence, that there was no risk of escape and that he had a mental disorder.The police, trying to reassure worried parents on Twitter, said: So far there is no evidence of a sexual motivation or of malicious intent. Visiting a playground in Berlin is no more dangerous than usual.Heike S was quoted in local media as saying: I imagined what would it have been likeit had been my child. Now I also know that he is back. That he can stand in front of us again at any time. That he might recognise me and my daughter. Why didnt the police put up a notice at the playground  That is scary.Another mother, named in local media as Anne-Marei Heinrich, put a warning up on the gate to warn other mothers.She lives nearby, has two small children and said she is also worried that the perpetrator could soon be back at the playground again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Language barriers, high levels of diabetes and poverty may have played a part in the new surge.But the decision to extend lockdown for the city was criticised by the city’s Labour mayor.Sir Peter Soulsby said: “If the virus is out of control or spreading with the restrictions, I can’t see how extending them for a further two weeks would make any dference.“What we have got is an assessment of the situation which admits that the increase in positives is as a result of increased testing, and that there is perhaps nothing in signicance in those results.“If there is anything out there, we need to see it and it needs to be at street level.”The Department of Health has deployed four military-run mobile testing units to the area to check residents for the disease.Thousands of home testing kits are also being made available.Health chiefs hope to identy as many cases as possible and tracing their contacts, so they can be told to isolate.They will also be contacting businesses that are open to encourage them to take measures to control the spread of the virus.Adverts in multiple languages on TV, radio and street signs will encourage people to stay at home.Officials will review the situation in two weeks and decide to ease, maintain or tighten the controls.Leicester residents and businesses reacted with despair to the news they would no longer be able to reopen on Super Saturday.Hairdresser Sandra May, , said: “I am absolutely furious and devastated.“I’ve had so many calls from customers wanting to know what’s happening.

I will be making no apology.    I did the right thing and would do it againneeds be. He branded Broadstairs racism on sea in his blog post and revealed he expected to be contacted by police.Writing on his blog, the brazen former local politician for Thanet said: “Just in case you hadnt already guessed, I was responsible for the spate of graffiti in Broadstairs and Ramsgate.”He was inspired by Broadstairs Town Council’s decision to retain the Uncle Mack memorial and Thanet Council’s review of its publicly funded racist properties and activities.The museum represents historic racism and therefore deserves to be tarnished, he alleged.Mr Driver went on: “I selected the targets as they represent the deep-rooted institutional racism of Broadstairs Town and Thanet District councils.“Broadstairs Dickens Week and Folk Week charities openly support, celebrate, and fund with public money, offensive blacked up Morris dancers, Uncle Mack’s blacked up Minstrel show memorial, and genocidal racists such as Charles Dickens and King Leopold of Belgium.”The vandal revealed that the council’s lack of interest in his personal protest has led him to graffiti.Driver continued: “I have been campaigning against, what I believe to be, the institutional racism of the Broadstairs and Dickens and Folk week events and the Broadstairs and Thanet councils for several years but to no avail.“I have now been forced, by the inaction, of these organisations to take direct measures to expose the appalling racism of our local government and some of our major charities who are being funded by the councils.“Although I live here and love the place, in my opinion Broadstairs richly deserves the epithet Racism-on-Sea.“My actions are nothing to do with the Black Lives Matter movement, of which I am a supporter, and are purely part of my own inidual protest for which I alone am responsible.”The toppling of the statue of slave owner Edward Colston in Bristol inspired Driver - and he maintains that defacing memorials is a legitimate part of protest.“I fully support and encourage this form of political expression wherever and whenever it is necessary, especially in my hometown which, to its shame, is rapidly becoming known as Racism-On-Sea”, he added.Kent Police have been contacted for comment.The Dickens House Museum in Broadstairs, Kent, was the inspiration for Betsey Trotwood’s home in David Copperfield, and Dickens is known to have visited regularly.Shocked locals noticed Dickens Racist, Dickens Racist was left in black ink this weekend on the property’s front wall, while a road signed had been painted over.Judith Carr said: “What madness! Aside from the fact that it is illegal to deface private property, Dickens spent his le pointing out the evils of social injustices of all kinds.”Phil Harradence said: “Please tell me the uneducated, knuckle dragging moron responsible for this have been caught on CCTV “Have we now lost complete control of sense in this country, absolutely disgusting behaviour.

A lot of historical figures actually had views of ‘primitive’ cultures.“Im not saying he was a full blown kkk racist, but instead of jumping on this as mindless, do a bit of research and consider why this was put there.”The property, named ‘Dickens House’ before the end of the th century, was bought by the Tattam family in .In  it was gted to the town by Dora Tattam and opened as a museum according to the terms of her will.The character Betsey Trotwood is based on Miss Mary Pearson Strong who lived in the cottage that is now the museum.According to Charles Dickens’ son Charley, he and his father regularly had tea and cakes in the parlour with Miss Pearson Strong.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So the announcement, trailed in the Sunday papers and made today by Boris Johnson, of £bn for a national school building project, is of particular interest. Mostly, because it shows that for £, a year Eton taught him no maths whatsoever.All children deserve the best possible start in le, he said. Itaposs important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.Except the £bn is over  years, and for  projects. So thataposs  schools a year, at £m each, even though in  a new primary cost around £m.Between  and , the Tories opened  aposfree schoolsapos, costing £.bn. So that was  schools a year, at an average of £.m each. A much better rate ofthan we are now offered, even though around £m of it went on lawyers.Between  and , the Building Schools for the Future programme rebuilt or refurbished  schools. It was going to invest £bn over  years and rebuild every secondary in the country. Its flaws - a lack of big-project expertise in local councils, PFI fees, and the fact it was a Labour idea - meant the Tories cancelled it. BSF was the biggest school building programme since the Victorian one, which had put a primary school in almost every town and village in the country. Have you spotted the pattern  We have spent an ever-decreasing proportion of our cash on schools, for more than a century.Last year it was revealed weaposll need , new classrooms for a .% increase in primary pupils by . For Johnsonaposs plan to meet that demand, the first  schools he promises next year would need to have , classrooms - each.The National Audit Office says our , primary, middle and secondary state schools need a total of £.bn of repairs - just repairs - but the PM has offered them £m for crumbling buildings. Thataposs % of whataposs needed, or £, per school. With an average primary school refurbishment cost of £, per square metre, that would pay for .sq metres. Or about half a classroom.BSF built schools, slowly, in areas where they were wanted. Free schools has put them, quicker, where they are not needed. A report by the Education Policy Institute last year found far fewer of them being opened in hampered areas. And during lockdown, it is children in those places which have suffered most, had least access to the technology needed to keep up, and now need the most help. To recap, class: the PM has promised £bn over  years for  schools which will be the most expensive, and biggest, ever built. He is also offering % of the repairs we need to existing schools, which still have to find room for .% more pupils in the next  years.He has not mentioned where he is going to get this money from, whether itaposll be raised from taxation, borrowing, or provided by private finance.We do know, however, that it is only % of the £.bn funding by  that he promised in his election manesto just  months ago. His forest of magic money trees seems to have developed a series case of cash dieback.Johnson is threatening to fine parentsthey do not send children into schools where % of repairs will not be carried out, and pupil numbers will grow but classrooms will not. Heaposs cajoling voters with headlines about a schools building programme which would more accurately be described as a £bn cut on just one of the impossible promises he made to voters. Add that all up, and you have a Prime Minister, and a government, that are so antithetical to logic, history, and basic mathematics that they should be kept as far away from the state school system, pupils and parents, as humanly possible. I suggest we send him back to Eton, and throw away the key. Itaposs cheaper than letting him loose, and perhaps its teachers will realise that priding themselves on producing Prime Ministers means that,a pupil is neither great or good, they shouldnapost be allowed to graduate.

But the National Residential Landlords Association said some cases that were not linked to coronavirus should resume now. Policy director Chris Norris told the Commons Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee landlords were in judicial limbo and eviction courts will see a backlog. Askedit should be extended beyond August , he replied: We donapost think it should be extended. “In fact I think at the moment there are certain cases that we could be getting some of the case management dealt with now. “So when weaposve got those cases that have got absolutely nothing to do with the Covid crisis - those cases where in many many instances a possession order was actually granted prior to lockdown - we donapost see any reason why we couldnapost start opening up the system so they could be progressed now as lockdown is being lted. “We certainly don’t see any need for a continuation of this blanket ban on possessions that we see that the moment.” It came as charities and campaigners urged the government to put in a long-term plan to deal with a financial crisis to come.  Caitlin Wilkinson of Generation Rent told MPs “we need to see some additional protections” - otherwise “huge numbers of tenants will be unable to pay their rent and will lose their home as a result”. Ruth Ehrlich, Policy Officer at Shelter, estimated between % and % of renters have accrued arrears during the crisis - up from around % normally. She claimed more than a million people could now be in arrears - which would increase as the furlough scheme ends and more paychecks are missed. Ms Ehrlich warned: “, renters have been told by their landlord that they are going to be evicted in the coming months.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad describes post lockdown reality","story":"NewsDad who went to Chessington Zoo after it reopened says its just not worth itMatt Strudwick had been looking forward to a family day out and a change of scenery from the two mile beaten track around his house he had worn out since March  - but the experience wasnt quite what hed imaginedShareByMatt Strudwick:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video zoo-days-chessington-world-adventures-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news dad-describes-post-lockdown-reality-\"\", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But after his trip to Chessington Zoo he said it is safe to say that post-lockdown zoo days at the theme park belong like its animals on the day - firmly in the shade. The unenviable depressing milestone of  days of being in lockdown was fast approaching for Matt and the screams for some sense of normality were getting louder. When Chessington announced it would be reopening its zoo, an audible gasp rumbled throughout his home. But Surrey Liveaposs content editor Matt has described his experience in an opinion piece...  The mundane trudge of a daily . hour sht of sitting on a wooden chair, with my back creaking, at my dining room table, where the memory of weekends had evaporated, would at last be broken. We could finally have a family day out. The relief I felt was more for my -month-old son, as I am sure he was becoming increasingly puzzled as to why his father was spending more time looking at a rectangular bright screen than playing with him. No sooner than it was announced had we swtly, and quite easily, booked our tickets through the website. The empty calendar and crossed out planned events ruined by the coronavirus pandemic finally had a new entry June  - Chessington. The day out The day had finally arrived. A Wednesday, but by now Wednesday meant as much to me as any other day. It didnapost matter, and the sunaposs blistering heat, which was causing the mercury to edge towards C, only added to our enthusiasm. With the theme park just a  minute drive from our house in Dorking, we decided it was best to head out in the afternoon after our toddler had had his nap and had a full stomach. Our entry into Chessington felt like any other time we had gone - until the barrier lted. Cones taped together direct you, and red signs with bold white letters tell you to remain in your car where you will be temperature checked before being allowed to enter a car park.  All seemed clear and simple, but that was as much clarity we were greeted with throughout our day and the waters would become murkier with each added confusion. If youaposre missing the thrill of the rides, then the journey to the car park takes on its own epic route, though itaposs lacking in any exhilaration. We passed two unmanned empty tents and muttered to each other that surely this is where the temperature checks are supposed to take place  With no-one in sight we continued our circuitous drive before alarmingly ending up at the exit barrier. A security guard came to our aid and they seemed more in shock that we were arriving at pm rather than how we had become lost.  We were kindly ushered into a near barren car park, with just a littering of cars cowering in the shade, used by Merlin annual passholders. The bumpy start to our family trip was not going to dampen our suncreamed bodies, and we excitedly made our way up to the entry gates where the promised temperature checks were painlessly conducted by a PPE-kitted staff member. Bag checks done, we entered the eerily quiet theme park, but with the added plus that there were no queues. We were handed a leaflet explaining what was open, and informed of one eatery offering food that wasnapost listed, as well as some handy safety tips as you make your way around the apparent one-way system. One thing is for sure, you canapost walk five metres without being met by a hand sanitiser dispenser, and signs telling you to clean your paws and to keep two metres apart.  A day that promised so much but delivered as much entertainment as the Star Wars prequel trilogyapos The one-way system starts in Wanyama Village, and unless youaposre equipped with an inbuilt GPS or are a frequent visitor of the park, finding it is an added frustration. After we walked through the Rainforest where the promise of tortoises was unfulfilled, we had to ask a friendly staff member to point us in the right direction. It was here, too, where the unlisted food outlet was supposed to be bustling. Instead, the shutters were pulled down with only the sad existence of a lonely barrier strap as evidence that it had been open. We hastily found the Wanyama Village and were guided by painted yellow arrows on the floor, and passed numerous hand sanitiser dispensers and one-way system signs - as, confusingly, some families walked the other way. It was only when we reached the enclosure where we were greeted by the magnicent sight of giraffes, zebras, and ostriches meandering in the field that we understood why people were walking against the one-way system, as there was an exit only sign directing to where we had just come from.  The two metre social distancing guidelines were also impossible to adhere to as you made your way up the ramp to overlook the vast enclosure, as, as expected, this is where most people were congregating. After much pointing and with our anxiety levels heightened having come in close contact with other humans, we descended before continuing on the one way route. Meerkats, Ankole Cattle, Bolivian Squirrel Monkeys, Sea Lions, and of course the Humboldt Penguins easily became the highlight, but it was to the Trail of the Kings and the anticipation of seeing the Asiatic Lions and Western Lowland Gorillas that topped our list. Not for the first time, locating it was another matter. Having sought the guidance from another helpful staff member, we made our way to our highlighted destination where it was prewarned that limited capacity was in operation. There was no need to worry about the number of people, as pretty much like the visible guidance, it was minimal. Indeed, one employee told us the area had a capacity for  but at one point it only had eight people. Any hopes our trip would suddenly springboard onto an upward trajectory were dashed in an instant, as we walked the past the squeaky clean windows with only vegetation to look at. No doubt the hot weather had caused the wild animals to shy away, although we did see a lonely gorilla scratching his head."},{"url":null,"title":"hoards brits converting bedrooms offices","story":"NewsHoards of Brits converting bedrooms into offices and joining meetings in pyjamasA survey of , adults who are working from home carried out by Premier Inn examined how they have adapted after offices were forced to close in March due to the coronavirus lockdownShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUN NewsMany Brits are working from their bedrooms \", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Addressing concerns people may have about the raffle, the owner said: My parents still live in the area and brought me up with solid aposvaluesapos. I don’t need to steal and I also respect that people in le have to work extremely hard to get money. So, the £. fee was to make it accessible for everyone, I just dislike the idea of people being apospriced outapos. I have further reduced the risk to everyone by no one having to make a payment at present. The idea is simple order tickets and I will let you know when to pay.

It could face another two weeks in lockdown in a bid to control an outbreak of  coronavirus, it has been suggested. But it is not the only area experiencing a rise in cases, as a tally shows dozens of areas are still seeing more cases even as the spread of Covid- slows. New confirmed cases have been rising across  of the  upper-tier local authorities in England in recent weeks as the country moves through its lockdown phases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give an update to the Commons this evening after talks with Leicesteraposs leaders. Officials have suggested keeping in place current lockdown restrictions in the city - which are due to be lted across the country on July  - in order to stamp out the local outbreak. The country is bracing for pubs, hotels and places of worship and businesses like hairdressers to finally reopen. Brits will also be able to mix indoors more at each othersapos homes as long as social distancing guidelines are followed. But Leicester Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby claims he has been told the city could have to wait for another fortnight to follow the rest of the country into the easing of the lockdown rules. The city has recorded  new cases of coronavirus in the last two weeks, leading to speculation over the weekend that it would be locked down. Home Secretary Priti Patel has confirmed the Government are considering a lockdown in the area.  Sir Peter said any extension would mean pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, outdoor playgrounds and other areas would not reopen as planned on July . Soldiers from the Royal Logistics Corps have been pictured at a new mobile coronavirus testing site at Evington Leisure Centre in Leicester this morning. Figures show the areas around England where Covid- cases were still rising in recent weeks. Doncaster has seen a spike in new cases - from  in the week to June  to  last week.  Derbyshire saw  new cases in the week to June , up from  the week before. Currently, the method being used by local authorities to control the virus focuses on closing down settings such as businesses and schools where there are flare ups - and contact tracing those affected. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described this as a whack-a-mole strategy. It is currently unclear how a lockdown in a particular town or city would work in practice. The Government and officials from Leicester were due to meet this afternoon to discuss the recommendations.  Other countries which have seen sudden spikes, such as Germany, are currently implementing similar localised lockdowns. Some  people are still testing positive for coronavirus every single day across the UK. The UK has now suffered more than , deaths from the virus, the worst death toll in Europe. The Government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid- across the UK, which are thought to have passed ,.  Areas with spiking coronavirus cases The English cities, counties and London boroughs which have seen coronavirus case rises in recent weeks are, in alphabetical order:Barking and Dagenham\u2028 Brent \u2028Derbyshire\u2028 Doncaster\u2028 Ealing\u2028 Enfield\u2028 Gateshead\u2028 Gloucestershire\u2028 Hammersmith and Fulham\u2028 Haringey\u2028 Harrow\u2028 Havering\u2028 Hounslow\u2028 Isle of Wight\u2028 Kensington and Cha\u2028 Leicester\u2028 Medway\u2028 Milton Keynes\u2028 Plymouth\u2028 Portsmouth\u2028 Redbridge\u2028 Redcar and Cleveland\u2028 Richmond upon Thames\u2028 Sandwell\u2028 Slough\u2028 Suffolk\u2028 Sunderland\u2028 Tower Hamlets\u2028 Wakefield\u2028 Walsall\u2028 Wandsworth\u2028 Westminster\u2028 Wigan\u2028 Wiltshire\u2028 Windsor and Maidenhead\u2028 YorkHow will areas be selected for localised lockdown  Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month said that regional flare-ups of the virus in England would result in local lockdown. He told a Downing Street briefing there would be local lockdowns in the future with the Joint Biosecurity Centre having a responsethat could address local spikes in infections, in partnership with local public health agencies.

Non-essential shops and schools will close again as a surge in Covid- cases means the city will not reopen with the rest of England on Saturday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons: “Given the growing outbreak in Leicester, we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown set to take place on July  happens in Leicester.” Mr Hancock said % of all positive cases in the UK in the past week were in the city. He added: “While cases in most parts of the country have fallen, in Leicester they have continued to rise.” Non-essential shops in the city will close from tomorrow and schools will close to most pupils from Thursday. Mr Hancock said: “To people in Leicester – stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel.” The rules will apply to the city and the immediate surrounding areas. Health officials will go to affected workplaces to ensure they are Covid-compliant. A new walk-in testing centre will be opened, while extra funding will be given to the local authorities for a promotional drive to encourage anyone with symptoms to get tested. The Mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, said he was told in an email from Government officials at am yesterday that the city would be shut for two weeks.  But there was confusion as Mr Hancock waited until pm to make an official announcement. There were  new confirmed cases of Covid- in Leicester in the last two weeks, bringing the city’s total to ,. Many more cases are thought to be going undetected. Sources told the Mirror that the outbreak is linked to the reopening of Leicester’s textiles industry in late April, two weeks before the Government told people toto work. Hundreds of new cases in early June were in people in the east of the city, where hundreds of clothing factories are based. PM Boris Johnson said yesterday: “We are concerned about Leicester. We are not out of the woods yet.”Local leaders demanded data to justy singling the city out. Sir Peter said: “There is no reason to pick on Leicester and to impact on our economy and our businesses. “I’m not saying we shouldn’t take special action, just that I would need to be convinced that there was something unique about our city before we agreed to an extension of the lockdown.” He claimed cases are higher in Leicester due to more testing. Six schools had to shut, while there were cases at two Sainsbury’s stores, and sandwich and biscuits factories.  Nationally, Covid- infections have stopped falling for the first time in months. Scientists in the Independent SAGE group said the NHS test and trace system is not yet “fit for purpose”, and is only reaching a third of symptomatic cases. Local health officials, including Leicester’s Director of Public Health, say they cannot access its data. The Mirror understands that at least five Leicester garment factories that reopened in lockdown had to shut again due to staff outbreaks. A source said: “One of these factories had more than  cases. Workers have not been furloughed.

From today non-essential shops in Leicester must close all over again and schools will shut their doors from Thursday. As the rest of England prepares to ease restrictions from July , the reopening of pubs and hairdressers in the city has been cancelled because of rising cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesteraposs seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city. A dedicated walk-in centre, extra funding and support, and Covid-secure workplaces have been announced by Downing Street in an effort to fight the virus. Here is a rundown of how the unprecedented local lockdown will work. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  What are the local lockdown measures in Leicester  Non-essential shops which opened on June  must shut from Tuesday onwards in Leicester. That includes clothes shops, toy shops and clothes shops. It means many retail firms in Leicester must not open their doors on Tuesday morning - despite the lockdown coming with just hours to spare, after they closed up for the night. Primary schools which opened to some pupils from June  must once again close in Leicester, to all but the most vulnerable or children of key workers, from this Thursday.  Pubs, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers and more in the city will not reopen as in the rest of England on July . And shielding for vulnerable people will not be eased in Leicester when it is in the rest of England on July . People in Leicester must once again “stay at home as much as you can” and cease non-essential travel. So is the law now dferent in Leicester to the rest of England  Not yet, but it will be soon. The Department of Health and Social Care is expected to publish a law enacting the measures on Tuesday. It is likely to be similar to the laws that enforced lockdown in the rest of England.  It’s not yet confirmedpeople will be hit with fines of £ for breaching the tighter local lockdown. Will there be roadblocks to enforce it  Matt Hancock did not mention roadblocks in his statement and No indicated they were not the priority. However, the Health Secretary also warned: We recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester. If people continue to travel in and out of the city, the government has not explicitly ruled out such checks in future.  Where exactly does it apply  The drastic measures also apply to surrounding areas including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield. Leicestershire County Council public health bosses have been charged with drawing up areas to fall under the local lockdown. A more specic description of which areas are affected is expected to be announced on Tuesday. How long will the local lockdown last  It looks like it will last at least two weeks. The local measures have no fixed end date and will be reviewed for the first time in two weeksapos time. Could there be more local lockdowns     Yes, it’s possible. Boris Johnson promised a “whack-a-mole” approach to local outbreaks and Mr Hancock said there could be “local lockdowns”.But the government has also been accused of responding too slowly to Leicester, where concerns were raised weeks ago. Why Leicester  Matt Hancock revealed % of all positive cases in the country over the past week have been in Leicester. He said the  day infection rate in the city is  cases per k people - three times higher than the next highest city. And there are six to  admissions to hospital a day rather than one a day at other trusts.  Sources have told the Mirror meat processing plants and gatherings around takeaways have come under the spotlight as a possible source of the outbreak. And Labour’s Leicester MP Jon Ashworth pinpointed high poverty and a large BAME population who are at greater risk. What support will the city get  The city - which has already had four mobile testing units sent in - will now receive further testing capability including a walk-in centre. There will also be extra funding for Leicester and Leicestershire councils for public information campaigns, including translations in “appropriate languages”. Support will be made available to those who have to self-isolate and the government will work with specic workplaces that have seen clusters of cases.  Nick Rushton, leader of Leicestershire County Council, said: “Protecting residents is our main concern and we’re working closely with Leicester City Council and the Government to bring down the number of cases.“Clearly coronavirus does not adhere to lines on a map. And although county rates are below the national and regional averages, we can’t be complacent and it makes sense to step up restrictions in areas closer to the city.“This is the first localised lockdown on this scale and undoubtedly there will be issues to iron out.

Katie told the Daily Mail the new lockdown means she has had to apospush backapos clients who were booked in and things have been left aposin the airapos with upset customers and staff who were expecting to start earning again. She said: We’ve ordered PPE for them, we’ve set up screens in the salons and we are booked out for the next three weeks. It has cost up to £, to prepare the salons – mainly the cost of the screens, but there are other things around it such as marketing videos for social media and deep cleaning. Since the UKaposs lockdown started on March  staff at the three salons have been furloughed - a scheme which Katie said has saved the -year-old business but they need to reopen as they have big overheads. Meanwhile pub landlady Moira Rossiter said she feared Leicester was being used as a lockdown ‘guinea pig’ for the rest of the country. The -year-old, who runs the Sir Robert Peel pub in the city, said she had ordered beer and spent aposhoursapos working out seating plans and a new layout to ensure drinkers adhere to social distancing guidelines. She said: It’s really dficult news to take, not just for pubs and restaurants but for all businesses which have been preparing hard for this. Our insurance wouldn’t cover us for the first lockdown so it won’t cover us for this.  Shabir Jakhura, owner of Jak’s Stationers, reopened a fortnight ago but now has to close for business on Thursday. He told the Mail: Oh God. This is going to be really dficult. Business had slowly been picking up since we reopened.. To make us close again is going to be really tough. The lockdown is Leicester is expected to last at least two week. Announcing the new measures last night Health Secretary Matt Hancock ordered non-essential shops and schools to close.  People in the city have been told to stay in their homes and only travelitaposs necessary. Shielding for vulnerable people will not be eased in Leicester when it is in the rest of England on July . Mr Hancock said a new law will be passed shortly to enforce the measures - but stopped short of announcing roadblocks for travel in and out of Leicester. Mr Hancock said % of all positive cases in the country over the past week have been in Leicester and the  day infection rate in the city is  cases per , people - three times higher than the next highest city.  He said: We are of course looking across the country and the cities where this virus remains higher than where. However, the number of cases in Leicester is three times higher than the next highest city. Leicester MP and Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth warned thousands of businesspeople are now in limbo in his city - urging more financial support for those hit. He said proudly erse Leicester was particularly at risk due to high poverty and large numbers of people in the more at-risk BAME community.  The city - which has already had four mobile testing units sent in - will now receive further testing capability including a walk-in centre. There will also be extra funding for Leicester and Leicestershire councils for public information campaigns, including translations in “appropriate languages”. Support will be made available to those who have to self-isolate and the government will work with specic workplaces that have seen clusters of cases. Mr Hancock said: I know that this is a worrying time for people living in Leicester and I want you to know you have our full support.

In their book Royals at War, investigative journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett claim Meghan made the decision to tell people - and it didnapost go down well with Harry. They claim that it left the Duke of Sussex embarrassed, and Princess Eugenie and her mum Sarah Ferguson furious. They write: Meghan put her foot in it when she decided that it would be the ideal moment to announce that she and Harry were expecting their first child. This was a huge social gaffe, evenyou were not a Royal – stealing the limelight from Eugenie, who was furious, as was her mother, Sarah. However when Archie arrived in May, the Queen, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and other members of the family rushed to congratulate the couple, who are now living in LA.There were claims at the time that the announcement had upset the bride, with US gossip website Radar Online claiming it had angered Eugenie, who was already dealing with stress of criticism over her pricey wedding.Eugenie disappeared for a while after Harry and Meghan told the Royal Family the news, an insider allegedly said. Any bride would have had their nose put out of joint by something like that. At the time of the official announcement on October , many fans criticised Meghan and Harry for making the announcement so close to Eugenieaposs wedding.  There were several cruel claims on social media that the Sussexes had stolen Eugenie and Jackaposs thunder.However other claimed they were left with little choice because of their upcoming tour.One Twitter user wrote: If Harry and Meghan did actually tell the Royal Family about their baby at Eugenie’s wedding on Friday, that’s pretty shady.Another added: Meghan couldn’t let Eugenie be centre of attention for long could she. A third simply wrote: Thunder stealer.  Sarah Ferguson reacted by sharing photos of her daughter and new son-in-law just half an hour after Meghan and Harry made their official announcement. She tweeted: So proud of Eugenie and Jack #wedding at .am today, and also posted the same image on her official  Instagram  page."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\", url\"News, views and top stories .

For the past three months many Brits have had to forgo their favourite pastime of going to the pub because of the coronavirus pandemic. While more than , people have died in the UK from Covid-, the daily death rate is now low enough for the Government to ease lockdown restrictions on restaurants, bars and pubs. However, things will not be going straight back to normal. When their doors open at the weekend people will only be able to meet up with members of one other household. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror As well as deciding who you want to share your first frosty pint of the summer with ahead of time, it may be wise to book in advance. Many pubs are only accepting people who have booked places due to lower than normal capacities. Drinks are required to reserve a seat in stripped down boozers that have removed seats and tables to allow for social distancing. For those lucky enough to find themselves inside, then a set of rules will govern how the night unfolds. While ordering at the bar is not banned, drinking at it is.  Pubs will also have to have new measures in place to make sure people can stand at least a metre apart from each other with added mitigation - which could include perspex screens and masks, gloves or visors for staff. As a result, many pubs are expected to only offer table service or encourage customers to user ordering apps. Pub visitors will also be asked to give their name to the pub landlord at the door. This temporary record will now be kept by pubs for  days so those who visit can be contactedthere is a breakout of localised coronavirus. Inside pubs, one-way systems will be used to ensure people do not cross paths.  It is hoped that single-direction traffic inside will reduce congestion and minimise contact between customers. The Government guidance also outlines that doors should be left open, where appropriate, to reduce touchpoints. Maintaining good ventilation is also important and therefore windows and doors should be kept open as much as possible. In addition, pubs are urged to use a one in one out system with toilets to minimise customer interaction. Live performances are not permitted, including music, drama and comedy. Although this will not be a strict rule, customers are asked not to speak too loudly in a bid to lower the chances of oral tranmission.  The Government guidance reads: “All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. “This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. “This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission.” When sitting inside pubs or restaurants, people will be allowed to gather at a social distance in groups of six, with a maximum of two households involved. This six-person limit will also apply to pub gardens, although friends from more than two households will be permitted to socialise.

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard on Monday allegations of widespread historic abuse at ious childrenaposs homes run by Lambeth Council. Former residents who lived at the homes in the s, s and s claimed they were physically and sexually abused by those in charge of their care at the time. The inquiry, which is due to last four weeks, will investigate whether there were child protection failures by public authorities, including the police and council. Rachel Langdale QC, counsel to the inquiry, said the councilaposs Angell Road home - which opened in  - was run by the convicted child sex abuser Michael Carroll, who was also known as John Carroll.  She told the inquiry that Carroll had concealed his criminal past when he applied for a role at the childrenaposs home, but added that Lambeth Council later became aware of his background. Ms Langdale said: You will hear that Lambeth came to know of his conviction from Croydon Council when Carroll and his we applied to become foster parents . She added: Lambeth officials decided that Carroll should not be dismissed on account of his previous conviction, nor on account of his concealment of it. Carroll was dismissed in  because of financial irregularities, Ms Langdale said. He was jailed for  years at Liverpool Crown Court in  after admitting a string of sexual assaults against children while working in residential care between  and . The inquiry also heard allegations of physical and sexual assault taking place at the councilaposs other childrenaposs homes, including Shirley Oaks, the South Vale Assessment Centre and Ivy House.  Ms Langdale said Shirley Oaks was the oldest and largest residential care home for children aged two to  years under the control of Lambeth Council. The home allowed for members of the public, known as social aunts and uncles, to volunteer to spend time with children by taking them away on day trips or on holiday, the inquiry heard. Ms Langdale said Lambeth Council accepts that during the operational period of Shirley Oaks, which could house up to  children, there were no requirements for staff to hold social work qualications or to be police checked. It appears the doors to Shirley Oaks, in essence, may have been open to any adult professing an interest in taking children out, she said.

The Met Officeaposs long range weather report predicts more settled conditions next month. Relatively dry, settled and warm conditions...bringing some sunshine for most parts is likely from the middle of the month, it says, with some weather charts predicting the UK will sizzle. BBC forecaster Stav Danaos said before that, however, much of this week will be unsettled with temperatures struggling to reach the average for the time of year. Brief high pressure on Thursday could offer some respite before temperatures hot up for July  - the day pubs re-open in England - though rain could still be on the cards.  With low pressure moving off towards Scandinavia overnight a tangle of weather fronts have been left behind, Mr Danaos said.Despite yesterdayaposs strong mph gusts dying down a little, itaposs set to be a cloudy start with rain in the south west spreading across the south of England and Northern Ireland. Scotland is likely to see the best sun on Tuesday, though the combination of fronts could also mean heavy maybe thundery showers.  The majority of the country will see temperatures in the high teens, with the south west potentially reaching highs of C with light winds. Wednesday will be another cloudy day with winds making things really chilly, though the south will be warmer. If the sunshine breaks through that cloud could set off heavy showers or thunderstorms, mainly through Wales, Midlands and East Anglia, warned Mr Danaos. High pressure will settle things down on Thursday, however, with highs of C likely but low pressure comes streaming in off the Atlantic on Friday meaning a wet and windy end to the week.

My rockstar of a bride gets out of the car, wedding dress and all, and rushes over to help while I called . Rachel held this woman and talked to her so nicely and helped her as well as the paramedics that came later. She held her for at least  minutes until the EMTs got her on a stretcher. I am so blessed to have a wonderful we who will always take care of people who need it, and we were blessed that we were able to be in the right place at the right time to make a dference. Rachel and I are on our way to our honeymoon, and I am still blown away that she got out of the car in a scary situation to do what she does best. I can’t wait for a hospital to scoop her up so she can make a dference in people’s lives every day. I am so proud of my we. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my le with someone who is truly a servant of God, and to serve alongside her. The injured woman in the picture is reportedly Tamara Peterson. A car and a van had reportedly crashed in the St South Paul area of the city, and while the occupants were talking, a third vehicle came through the intersection and ran into the other cars. According to a crowdfunder set up for Ms Peterson by her daughter, she had arrived at the scene after her son was involved in the initial crash. When the third vehicle piled up she was hit too and she became pinned between two cars.Mrs Taylor told local newspaper Mercury News : I saw a couple of people dragging a woman over to the side of the road, Taylor said.I could see a gash in her right leg.

Alexandra Jechorek, , was astonished when her daughter, Maya, had a glossy mane before she was even born. The Dublin woman had been born bald, the same as her office worker boyfriend, Lee Bond, , and their son, Kadin, five. This led the stay-at-home mum to believe that all babies came out of the womb that way. She said: Weaposd already found out we were expecting a girl at the previous scan, so at  weeks, we were just excited to see how much sheaposd grown.Was your baby born with an amazing amount of hair  Email webnews@mirrorWhen the midwe turned the screen around, I honestly couldnapost believe my eyes. There was this tiny little baby on the scan with a full head of hair. I just thought, aposNo way, this cannot be possibleapos. To be completely honest, I thought all babies were born bald. My oldest Kadin came out bald, so I just thought that was how babies were when they were born. But once Iaposd taken in how much hair she had, it made me all the more excited to meet her, as Maya already looked like a proper little person. Six weeks later, on June , , Maya was born at The Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, in Dublin, weighing lbs oz.  Alexandra laughed: As soon as Maya arrived, I couldnapost take my eyes off her hair. Iaposd been expecting her to have hair because of the scan, but to see this beautul baby with this thick jet black hair was incredible. It had already grown so long it was down past her ears. Even the nurses and the doctors turned to me and said theyaposd never seen a baby with so much hair in all the time theyaposd worked at the hospital. Soon Mayaaposs incredible mop was commanding attention everywhere she went.  We couldnapost leave the house without someone complimenting Maya on her hair, Alexandra said. Lots of people would ask, aposHow old is she apos They were shocked when I told them she was only three months old with so much hair! While Alexandra has never measured her daughteraposs locks, she says that, now one years old, it is so long that it skims the top of her nappy. She said: Iaposve never had her hair cut. I think itaposs absolutely beautul and I want her to grow it as long as she wants. Having such long hair means Maya has already been able to experiment with a host of dferent styles. Her mum shows them off on her very own Instagram site, where she already has  followers.Mayaaposs really good she always sits still and lets me do her hair, said Alexandra. I do it in plaits and sometimes I tie it in a ponytail. I love putting bow clips in her hair. I have dferent colours, like pink, blue, red and yellow, to match the dferent outfits that she wears. Mayaaposs beautul hair means that, despite her tender age, her mum puts her through a demanding regime.  I shampoo and conditioner her hair every day, said Alexandra. Then I brush it through and spray on some stay-in conditioner and dry it with a towel. It takes about  minutes, which is quite a long time considering Iaposm doing a one year oldaposs hair. With her Instagram profile growing, Alexandra now hopes one day to launch Maya as a baby model. People love looking at pictures of Maya - they canapost get enough of her hair, she said. I usually post pictures of her dferent hairstyles or of her playing with Kadin.  But the comments are always about how amazing Mayaaposs hair is. With no family history of babies with hair, Alexandra says Mayaaposs amazing mop is a complete fluke. She said: Iaposve asked around my family and Leeaposs to seeanyone  was born with hair like Mayaaposs, but everyoneaposs told me no, so it mustaposve just been a fluke. And itaposs weird that she has such dark hair, as when Kadin was a baby, he had such fine blond hair.

The asteroid, which struck the Earth off the coast of Mexico  million years ago, has long been believed to have killed off all dinosaur species except those that became birds. But some researchers have suggested that tens of thousands of years of large volcanic eruptions may have been the actual cause of the extinction event. Now researchers from Imperial College London, the University of Bristol and University College London have now shown that only the asteroid impact could have created conditions that made the planet uninhabitable for dinosaurs. They also suggest the massive volcanism could also have helped le recover from the asteroid strike in the long-term. Lead researcher Dr Alessandro Chiarenza, who conducted this work whilst studying for his PhD at Imperial, said: We show that the asteroid caused an impact winter for decades, and that these environmental effects decimated suitable environments for dinosaurs. In contrast, the effects of the intense volcanic eruptions were not strong enough to substantially disrupt global ecosystems.  Our study confirms, for the first time quantitatively, that the only plausible explanation for the extinction is the impact winter that eradicated dinosaur habitats worldwide. Research suggests the asteroid strike would have released particles and gases high into the atmosphere, blocking out the Sun for years and causing permanent winters. Volcanic eruptions also produce particles and gases with Sun-blocking effects, and around the time of the mass extinction there were tens of thousands of years of eruptions at the Deccan Traps, in present-day India.  To determine whether the asteroid or volcanism had more climate-changing power, researchers have traditionally used geological markers of climate and powerful mathematical models. In the new paper they combined these methods with information about what kinds of environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature, each species of dinosaur needed to thrive. They then mapped where these conditions would still exist in a world after either an asteroid strike or massive volcanism, and found that only the asteroid strike wiped out all potential dinosaur habitats.

Scientists say the new strain of virus is carried by pigs and genetically similar to Swine Flu. The new type of flu causes respiratory illnesses, and researchers say it is a candidate for the next viral pandemicit mutates and spreads from person to person. The strain, named G EA HN, thrives and multiplies in the cells that grow in the human airway. It recently emerged in pigs but can infect humans too, according to new research published in a journal article.The warning comes as the world remains in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic.Global Covid- deaths have passed ,, with millions more cases diagnosed since it was first reported to have emerged in China in December. The scientists wrote about the emerging influenza threat in the US journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, saying it had all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus. Similarly, animal-borne Covid- is believed to have originated at a aposwet marketapos selling wildle for consumption in Wuhan, before the virus spread around the world. They researchers also found evidence of recent infection with the new influenza virus originating with people who worked in abattoirs and the swine farming industry in China. The virus is termed as a G genotype, which the researchers said had become predominant in swine populations since .  The researchers urged urgent monitoring of pigs and people who came into contact with the new influenza strain. Following the Swine Flu outbreak of , that virusis now covered by the annual flu vaccine. Immunity and vaccines against seasonal influenza that are already common among human populations do not appear to protect people from the new G virus, the study warned.

By the time she was just  Mariam had given birth to another  babies, which she is having to raise alone after her husband walked out on the giant family. Now , Mariam has been told she suffers from a rare genetic condition, which means she kept having multiple births - despite begging doctors for help when she was just . Mariam has three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins and incredibly manages to care for and feed them all on her own. The fertile mum was just  when she was married to her husband, who at  was  years her senior. Just a year later she gave birth to her first set of twins. Now, she and all of her kids have no choice to live in appallingly cramped conditions in just four tiny homes made from cement bricks and a corrugated iron roof. Mariam, from Uganda, and her brood live surrounded by coffee fields. A doctor warned the mother that birth control, like the Pill, could cause her problems because she had unusually large oies. So after her first set of twins, the babies just kept coming. Ugandan families are often large with women having . children on average. This is one of the highest birth rates in Africa but even by these standards, Mariamaposs family is enormous. At just , Mariam had  children and desperately begged her doctor for help to stop her having any more. But once again the medical advice was that she should keep getting pregnant because her oy count was so high. Mariamaposs final pregnancy three years ago ended in tragedy when she gave birth to her sixth set of twins. One of the babies died while she was in labour and then her husband, who would often leave for weeks on end, left her for good. His name is now cursed in her family. Mariam said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money. But it was also after this birth that the mum finally got the medical help she needed to stop her having more babies. Dr Charles Kiggundu, a gynecologist at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, said: Her case is genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate, which is releasing multiple eggs in one cycle, which signicantly increases the chance of having multiples it is always genetic. Mariam confirmed that doctors had taken action to remove the risk of her becoming pregnant again. She said the doctor told her he had cut my uterus from inside. Nothing will come in the way of the dedicated mother doing all she can to provide for her children. She works as a hairdresser, an event decorator and collects and sells scrap metal. Mariam brews her own local gin to sell and makes herbal medicine. And she is determined her surviving children will have the very best start to le with most of her wages going on food, medical care, clothes and school fees. Hanging proudly on the wall of her tiny home are photos of her eldest children graduating from school. Despite Mariamaposs best efforts, one of her children, Ivan Kibuka, had to quit school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her. Even Mariamaposs early years were filled with heartbreak. Her mum walked out on her, her father and her five brothers and sisters just three days after she gave birth to Mariam. He father re-married and Mariamaposs step-mother poisoned her older siblings by mixing cut glass in with their food. They all died. A visit to a relative meant Mariam escaped with her le. She said: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant.I was told by relatives what had happened. The scars of her ordeal meant Mariam was desperate for a family of her own to love, although she admits she only ever wanted six children. Her youngsters have to make the best of what she manages to provide as a single parent. Metal bunk beds with thin mattresses are where  of her brood sleep in one small room with walls caked with grime. Others have to share mattresses on the floor while some of the children are forced to sleep in the dirt because there is simply no space.  Everyone piles in to help with chores like cooking and clearning while the older children look after their younger siblings. Each day, Mariam uses kgs of maize floor to ensure her children have enough to eat. Although fish and meat are rare treats for the family. Mariam has to be organised to make sure each day runs smoothly on there is a rota of cooking and washing duties on a wooden board in the family home.

We thoughtthose clubs can break into that top , why can’t Aberdeen “Clubs in countries that are similar in size to Scotland so we are talking about Croatia, clubs in Scandinavia.“Ones that have gone on to be competitive in group stages.“Clubs that are not just getting to the group stage but being competitive or were punching above their weight.“Clubs like Malmo for example.“I know the landscape is dferent in each country with TV deals but we are trying to be creative in terms of what are the things that are going to give us the best opportunity to progress.“We don’t have the luxury of some of the TV deals that are in like-sized countries around Europe. So how can we be cleverer than some of those clubs in terms of what we are doing “With the fan base that we have and the infrastructure with the training ground and plans for the new stadium.“It was a line as to where we think the club should be.”Gunn accepts it will take a few years to break into that hallowed land of the Uefa top .Aberdeen will enter the Europa League at the first qualying round stage on August .Ties will be one-legged instead of the normal home and away format as Uefa attempt to cram in the rounds following the football shutdown due to Covid-.Gunn said: “This plan is more about a longer term plan.“This year, with the inidual legs,you look at the games we played at home against the bigger clubs in third qualying rounds previously, we’ve always been competitive.“If we don’t get there this year it doesn’t mean our plan has failed. This is a three- to five-year plan and we’re building up coefficient points over a period of time.“We’ve gone from th place in Europe to th now.“We were a bit higher at the start of the campaign but the performance of other clubs in the Champions League and Europa League has knocked down a few places.“However, we’ve made progress over the last six years. We didn’t jump from  to  in one year. It has taken time.”The Dons were knocked out of the Europa League - on aggregate at the third qualying round stage last season by HNK Rijeka of Croatia.In - the Dons dumped Rijeka out of Europe - on aggregate. Gunn highlights the Croatians as an example of how Euro success can ramp up the value of a squad.He said: “The other thing about top  is player value increases substantially when they play at that level.“Rijeka did well on that front and would sell players for a few hundred thousand Euros, but as soon as they got into the group stages their values went up to seven figures on a regular basis.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRumour has it the UK government will bring in a -day quarantine for some # but not all # airline passengers at the end of this month.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

who requested to remain anonymous - at a West London facility on Tuesday .The participant is now being closely monitored by the clinical team, who have since reported they are in good health, with no safety concerns.The dose is to be followed with a second booster dose within a four week period.The possible coronavirus vaccine has undergone rigorous pre-clinical safety tests, and has been shown to be safe during animal studies.

This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has.

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"feeling-nostalgic-summer-gala-days-years-gone","story":"It has been many years since I last attended Blackridge Gala Day, yet Ive found myself thinking about it a lot lately. Perhaps with all of the usual white noise of le stripped away, something deep-rooted in my memories has stirred and bubbled to the surface.I was less than a year old at my first gala day in . While I dont remember it, I know from photographs that my gran pulled out all the stops. The outside of her house and garden was beautully adorned with colourful bunting and decorations.This was a tradition that continued throughout my childhood. As I got older, I would excitedly jump from our old Datsun and go tearing in through the front gate, imagining the impressed faces of the judges as they scored the best-dressed house competition.The day itself followed a set routine. The parade was first, and without fail I would be cajoling everyone to make haste down the steep hill from my gran and grandpas house to the main street, my heart thudding in my chest with fear we might miss it.:Susan Swarbrick: Pondering the le lessons of dirty laundryI could already hear the skirl of bagpipes and thump of a bass drum at the far end of the village. Id listen as they steadily grew closer, craning my neck to catch a glimpse of the first float.My gran saved up coppers all year in an old Epsom salt jar, which gave them a dusty sheen that felt gritty and sometimes sticky as I grabbed a handful to throw into the passing collection bucketsAfter the parade, came the park. There would be stalls and races. This was also where you would collect the hallowed gala day box containing a gluttony of treats: a cold pie or sausage roll, a Mars bar, crisps, an iced cake and a plastic carton of juice.Id be allowed to eat one thing because a banquet awaited back at the house, my gran serving up dish after dish, just like she had when in service at a big house in Glasgow many years before.Usually by then the gala day committee would have been round to do the judging and a small piece of card would be proudly taped to the living room window, denoting a placing in the contest for best-dressed house. She even won one year.Rounding off the day was a visit to the shows, where we would eat candy floss, hook a duck, ride the carousel, tear around on the dodgems and take a spin on the waltzers until I was either feeling sick or had run out of pocket money.:Susan Swarbrick: Ill brave the midges this summer ndash our tourism sector needs usThere are no gala days this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, although I hope that, like me, in villages and towns across Scotland, there are others who are fondly reminiscing.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Given a recommendation by my local friendly golfing partner and ex-history teacher I embarked on reading Mao, The Unknown Story by Jung Chiang and Jon Halliday.I knew that Mao had committed a fair few atrocities but the scale staggered me. He was responsible for the deaths of more than  million of his own people whom he treated with total disdain and immense cruelty. Yet today Mao still has pride of place in Tiananmen Square and is officially revered by the Chinese population, of whom less than one per cent know the real truth of what really happened under Mao ndash and he only died in .While we in the West need to face up to our history, I seriously doubt that anyone will be holding the Chinese Communist Party to account for its past history.Letrsquos seethere are any protests, with or without kettling, in Tiananmen Square any time soon. Good luck having a BLM or statue protest there. The fact that we can have these protests is down to our democracy that we enjoy and be grateful.While we need to seriously reflect on our ancestorrsquos misdemeanours, we should not ignore other brutal regimes that still perpetuate to this day and we seem to give them for some reason, perhaps fear, a free pass.Ian McNair, Cellardyke.Time to relaunch the ferries projectTHE Covid emergency seems to have pushed the two new ferries being built for CalMac off the news agenda .

Firstly, under the previous guidance, education authorities were asked to be ldquocreative and imaginative in their drafting of their planning for theand many were far from that. Secondly and, more importantly, there was growing evidence about the detrimental effect on the wellbeing and mental health of our children from lack of contact with their pals and outdoor play opportunities as a result of the lockdown.A recent report, commissioned by the UKrsquos Play Safety Forum and written by David Ball, Professor of Risk Management at Middlesex University, contained evidence causing the author to come to the conclusion that the UK policy was much more harmful to children than beneficial. Citing statistics showing the extremely low risk to children from the virus and the evidence that childrenrsquos role in transmitting the virus being fairly limited, the report urges that childrenrsquos social and emotional wellbeing be prioritised in all decisions relating to the easing of lockdown and re-opening of schools.Also quoted in the report is the scientic consensus that the risk of transmission of Covid- is much lower outdoors than indoors due to air movement and the effect of UV light on the virus and on contaminated materials. All this would support allowing children to play together outdoors and to increase the trend to more outdoor education. We also should commend this report for its support of more rational, evidence-informed decision making.Harry Harbottle, Portpatrick.SO, after weeks spent implicitly criticising Boris Johnsons lockdown easing measures as overly hasty, Nicola Sturgeon, in response to sustained criticism, including from businesses, employers, workers, schools and parents, eventually provides lockdown lting plans for north of the Border. Most measures are being lted a day or so dferently to England ndash presumably just to be dferent, and bizzarrely, after her rhetoric around the need for caution, in some cases sooner than England.We still await news from the SNP administration about revisions to socialdistancing, without which shops and the hospitality industry cant . Doubtless this will also more or less replicate what Downing Street has decided, though using cosmetically dferent language and a slightly alternative timeline.And Ms Sturgeon claims shes above politics these days.Martin Redfern, Melrose.ROBERT McNeils articles are always highly enjoyable, and he is bang on the money with his comments regarding Boris Johnson splurging pound, of public money on repainting a plane . To do such a thing in these dficult days with businesses struggling due to lockdown and many people facing economic hardship is not just \"plane daft\" and an expensive and insensitive waste of public money, it suggests that Mr Johnson is up in the clouds when it comes to making sensible decisions, and one can only wonder what role his top political adviser and co-pilot Dominic Cummings played in this flight of fancy. Was it for advice like this that the Prime Minister stubbornly clung to Mr Cummings in the teeth of the publics disgust Mr Johnson needs to be brought back to earth with a bump, and face being grounded, permanently.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Keep an open mind on climate changeNEIL Rothnieobviously doesnt know that there are many theories on what makes the climate change, so I will enlighten him.He knows of the warming theory involving man-made greenhouse gases. The late Stephen Schneider was a leading proponent of this in  he announced to the world his concern for the build-up of CO in the atmosphere. Incidentally, pre- he was warning the world of a looming global cooling crisis, but all of his cooling work has been deleted.Many alternative theories on climate have been announced. In  Henrik Svensmark published his first paper on the link between cosmic rays and climate. In  Nicola Scafetta announced his research suggesting that most climate change is due to the influence of planetary motion on the sun, and William Gray suggested ocean currents. In  James Kamis suggested that mantle plumes and plate tectonics drove the climate, and in  Arthur Viterito suggested vulcanology.Many scientists have claimed that changes in the earths magnetic field are the dominant driving force on climate, or that simply nobody really knows.I respectfully suggest that Mr Rothnie be more open-minded.Geoff Moore, Alness.NEIL Rothnie may be genuine in his beliefs that mankind can save the planet by giving up fossil fuels His contempt for the North Sea oil industry is puzzling, since without it the UK would have been held to ransom by foreign nations. The UK has a miniscule . per cent of global emissions, Scotland .%, but ChinaIndiaand numerous other countries are still building coal-fired plants to drive their economies using cheap fossil-generated electricity, not mega-expensive wind electricity.Mr Rothnie mentions climate chaos but he, and others who believe the computer climate modelling forecasts, will be upset to learn that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has, once again, stated that there is little basis for claiming that droughts, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes have increased, much less increased due to greenhouse gases.Ever since climate scientists realised that there was a comfortable living to be made out of the threat of global warming there have been many hundreds of scary predictions, all of which failed to come to fruition.Will Mr Rothnie vow not to own, use or travel in any products which were derived from fossil fuels Clark Cross, Linlithgow.Why statues need to be removed\"MY name is Ozymandias, king of kings: look on my works, ye Mighty and despair!rsquoThus wrote Shelley in a poem subverting the vanity of power embodied in a statue.I would generally support the views expressed by Professor Wardle in his letterand the article by Kevin Mc Kennawhere Sir Tom Devine makes his arguments for a deeper scrutiny of Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade. Their views on the latter cannot be seriously contested.What is a statue  It is surely, amongst other things, an attempt to transcend time and space. These petried representatives of horror that fill our public spaces are not merely signicant in their materiality, they are also important as figurative projections of power, rank and prestige propelled from the past into the present. The intention behind them was that they were to be honoured and acknowledged as emblems of a dominant class who took their barbarous rule as a natural right. More importantly, they help underpin that same domination today.Any statue is both a presence and an absence. All statues fill a space and, simultaneously, obscure and conceal. I would argue that the removal of these monstrosities would help reveal the more authentic history desired by Prof Wardle and Sir Tom.Finally,we are to fully examine Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, we should endeavour to avoid clumsy conflations. The Scottish millworker and the Scottish crewman did not \"benefit\" from slavery. They were part of a dynamic of capitalist accumulation in which they had little say and little power. They led miserable lives characterised by long hours, disease and premature death. If Sir Tom wishes to insist they did benefit then he should at least employ some form of calibration and dferentiation. The slave owner and the merchant stole the lives of the slave and the wage slave.Alex Porter, Stirling.BEING a naturalised Scot of mixed West Indian British heritage, I have a concern that the more admirable aspects of the Black Lives Matter campaign are being ruined by a very sinister development.\"Taking the Knee\", originally a brave and meaningful gesture by black American sportsmen and equality campaigners, later adopted by supporters of all races, has been devalued by the way the media are using it.Singling out any public figure who is not an enthusiastic \"knee taker\" for opprobrium, effectively makes the act compulsory for anyone who does not want to risk their reputation, their job, or harassment by a large and angry segment of society.Many non-believers living in extremely strict religious communities will attend or comply with the requirements of that religion in order to fit in and avoid persecution ndash even though they live otherwise blameless and good lives. Compulsory gestures of solidarity or belief have no real value to any cause as they make it impossible to judge the true extent of \"belief\". Obligatory worship or participation in religious ritual by non-believers cannot be of any value to the Deity concerned.Neither politicians nor anyone  should be questioned or criticised about their non-participation in someone rsquos gestures or rituals. Instead, judge them by what they are actively doing in le to make things better now and in the future.Mark Openhsaw, Aberdeen.Degrees of stupidityI AGREE entirely with Priscilla Douglasrsquos rebuttal of Iain Macwhirterrsquos conflation of education and intelligence .Some years ago, I worked for a public service organisation whose basic entry requirements were numeracy, literacy and physical fitness. Practicality and common sense were advantageous, too. News came that one of our bases was to receive a recruit who had been educated to a high degree .

For that, blame prime ministerial push-ups. Mr Johnsonrsquos determination to prove to a Sunday paper that he was fit for purpose had led to the bizarre sight of the Prime Minister hitting the deck and giving the reporter hellip well, it was not specied how many push-ups he had done.First sign of a tone being set was BBC Breakfast host Chris Mason telling viewers that Marr was ldquolimbering up for his show.Marr, turning to the photo on the front of the Mail on Sunday, said: ldquoThis is the Prime Minister, adding ldquowe are told, asit was possible a body double was used.Then there was the PMrsquos description of himself as ldquofit as a butcherrsquos dog. That was deemed worth chewing over in the paper review, with Marr asking BBC correspondent Hugh Pym, ldquoas a health specialist what the phrase meant.ldquoWe were just speculating about that earlier, whether it meant the dog was fit because it would run around the butcherrsquos shop looking for scraps, or actually eating a lot of meat which probably isnrsquot exactly the message to get across to remain fit, said Pym.Normal, serious business was resumed when the shows turned to the sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey as Shadow Education Secretary for retweeting an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.: Iain Macwhirter on FMs economic recovery plansThe dismissal, which has sparked criticism on the partyrsquos left, took up almost the whole of Marrrsquos interview with Ed Miliband, Shadow Business Secretary.Mr Miliband said Ms Long-Bailey was a ldquovery decent person and he did not believe she was anti-Semitic, but the party leader was right to have acted as he did. This was not about a ldquopurge of the left, he insisted. ldquoHersquos not about purges, I know the guy, he said of Sir Keir.Marr ended on a lighter note by asking the former Labour leader a ldquoslightly mean question.Miliband was almost Tiggerish in his response. ldquoGosh yes, go on, yoursquove asked me many mean questions over the years.If ever there was a politician who looks liberated from the bonds of leadership it is Mr Miliband. Between how he got the job ndash by taking on his own brother ndash to his struggles with bacon sarnies, the MP for Doncaster North did not have his troubles to seek as HM Leader of the Opposition.ldquoYoursquove seen Keir Starmer now in operation for a few months, said Marr. ldquoIs he going to be a better leader of the Labour Party than you There was not a secondrsquos hesitancy. ldquoDefinitely. I think yoursquove seen that already. Look, I certainly never had his approval ratings.The Minister for the Sunday shows was Priti Patel. With the rapid easing of the lockdown in England, and scenes of disturbances at illegal gatherings, it was her job to figuratively read the riot act. ldquoWe can enjoy ourselves in a very responsible way, said Ms Patel.The usual pre-BBC pop-in to Ridge on Sunday yielded a story when Ms Patel was asked about those Labour MPs who had accused her of using her own experiences of racism to ldquogaslight the ldquovery real racism faced by black people in the UK.Ridge askedsome people had a particular problem with Ms Patel as ldquoa BAME woman who was a Conservative.Ms Patel said: ldquoThey clearly take the position that I donrsquot conform to their preconceived idea or stereotypical view of what an ethnic minority woman should stand for and represent. In my view, that in itself is racist.Marr, in true Columbo-style, had one last question for the Minister.

The mood music is not great. Last week, the UKrsquos chief negotiator castigated the EU on Twitter for ldquounrealistic positions that ldquowill have to change while re-stating the UKrsquos ideological positioning on its sovereignty.Covid- is, of course, the centre of political and public attention. But that doesnrsquot mean there is public support for the type of hard Brexit that Boris Johnson and his Brexiters want. In fact, a recent Kantar poll found % of UK voters now back remaining in the EU. But the UK has left the EU, so \"remain\" is not possible ndash only a rather unlikely re-join option .:Kirsty Hughes: Scotland needs to start working now to cement its Euro credentialsBut, in Scotland, the re-join option is not so unlikely nor absent from debate. Independence in the European Union is the Scottish Governmentrsquos clear, long-standing position. Any independent European state can indeed apply to join the EU ndash and despite plenty of hoops to jump through, there is, for now, plenty of goodwill in EU capitals towards Scotland.Meanwhile, in London, Keir Starmer is playing a cautious game on the EU-UK talks ndash hanging back, unlike the other opposition parties, from calling for a two-year extension of transition. Doubtless, Starmer will be ready to critique any basic free trade deal that emerges. But he is playing a long game, and any clear position on Labourrsquos preferred EU-UK deal is not obviously in the offing.In contrast, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Brexit policies are many and ied ndash from independence in the EU to keeping the whole UK in the EUrsquos customs union and single market, or keeping Scotland alone in the single market, or devolving migration policy to enable something akin to free movement of people.But, with deliberate continuity from Theresa May to Boris Johnson, the UK Government has chosen not to engage in any serious way with the devolved administrations. May and Johnson never tried to mend the Brexit ide across the UKrsquos four nations ndash their focus was solely on their core voters and their own backbenchers.So the Brexit fragmentation of the UK has deepened over the last four years, not least since Brexit day on January . Scotland not only voted Remain, together with Northern Ireland, four years ago, but the European debate here remains substantively dferent too.And itrsquos a debate that is intimately intertwined with the independence debate. A recent poll put support for independence at % ndash others have shown a smaller majority or a : split. One factor behind the increase in support for independence is previously pro-UK, Remain voters switching to Yes. While the Conservatives drive Brexit forward and Labour has accepted it, in Scotland, the SNPrsquos option of re-joining the EU will stay a core part of political debate and dynamics.This fundamental dference in English and Scottish political debates is there too in the more specic aspects of the EU-UK talks. The UK Government continues to reject EU demands for a level-playing field to ensure neither side undercuts the other on environmental and labour standards or state aids. Johnsonrsquos agreement, in last autumnrsquos EU-UK political declaration, to negotiate a level-playing field has been discarded by this most ideological of governments.:Kirsty Hughes: Brexit, lies and the Johnson charadeBut the Scottish Government wants its own partial level-playing field in devolved areas, including replicating EU environmental standards as far as possible. How that will play out in the context of other UK trade deals or in UK-devolved politics is an open question.The EU-UK talks are also blocked over fisheries, over judicial and police co-operation, and on overall governance and dispute settlement. Any hints of progress on the technical side in the talks are soon halted by new political pronouncements from London. And consultation between UK and Scottish governments remains non-existent beyond some granular technical discussions between officials.Yet, despite the UK bluster, a deal is perhaps slightly more likely than a no deal outcome. If London can portray a major compromise on its side, with a small sht by Brussels, as EU capitulation, then late October might see a deal ndash allowing time for the European parliament to raty it.But a deal will be thin and damaging. It will re-establish customs and regulatory barriers to trade it will hit the services sector particularly hard. It will slow growth and reduce investment compared to staying closer to the EU. And a no deal outcome will create more chaos and a harder economic hit ndash albeit with the withdrawal agreement still in place, so EU citizensrsquo settled status and the special deal for Northern Ireland will remain.A UK publicity campaign is due in July ndash pushing iniduals and organisations to prepare for the end of transition. But such preparations cannot realistically be done amidst the economic damage and uncertainty from the Covid- crisis, and without knowingthere will be a deal or what it will look like.The double damage from the Covid crisis and a hard Brexit plus premature end of transition will not go unnoticed in Scotland. The SNP faces its own challenges in the months ahead, as the fall-out from the Salmond saga continues. And currently favourable polls for the Holyrood elections next May could sht in our deeply unpredictable Covid era.But the UK, albeit with a special deal for Northern Ireland, is set for a hard orce from the EU. In Scotland, the debate over having that orce imposed on it will continue. The EU debate may be muted in England in the coming years. But in contrast, in Scotland, the European debate is set to stay a central part of the core constitutional debate.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The tourism industry will reopen in full on July .However, the Arran Ferry Action Group says some tourism businesses on the island are deciding whether to ldquohunker down and remain in mothballs until next year.Sam Bourne, a spokesman for the group, said: ldquoI know some businesses have decided not to reopen, hotels, guest houses, and self-catering accommodation providers. They do not have the confidence to hire staff, they do not have the confidence to buy stock and consumables to feed people.ldquoTo ramp up to open you have to spend money that there is no guarantee you will get back.He added: ldquoEvenit [tourism] is back up and running [businesses are worried] they wonrsquot have enough revenue to cover costs.The timetable brought in by CalMac on Sunday increases the number of daily sailings undertaken by the MV Caledonian Isles between Ardrossan and Brodick to five from two, and restores a service on Sundays, with four sailings on those days. However, because of the two-metre social distancing rule, the vessel will still only run at about  per cent of its usual , capacity.While as many as , passengers are normally ferried between Arran and the mainland per day in July, numbers are currently limited to .Mr Bourne said that eventhe service s to its usual summer frequency after the tourism industry reopens on July , the reduced capacity means it may not be viable for businesses on Arran to reopen.In addition to the limitations on capacity, Mr Bourne said the new timetable exacerbates the situation facing Arran locals because CalMac will no longer reserve spaces for people who need to travel to the mainland for vital medical appointments.He noted that by the time people receive notice of medical appointments, which is often less than one week in advance, the  places for the key morning sailing off the island andcrossing will already have been taken.Mr Bourne said this contrasts with the position for residents on the Western Isles, who he said have been given a commitment that places will always be made available for people travelling for medical appointments.Mr Bourne said: ldquoThere is no guarantee [for people on Arran]. Is there a special deal for the Western Isles  This is critical. The backlog for medical appointments is huge.Meanwhile, the Arran Ferry Action Group has welcomed confirmation from CalMac that it will permit passengers to stay in their vehicles on the crossing between Lochranza on Arran and Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula when it resumes on July , after securing an exemption from the Marine and Coastguard Agency . The route is served by the MV Catriona.Mr Bourne said: ldquoWe are slowly making progress, [but] even the north ferry is  passengers maximum and one sailing a day. It is marginal.The intervention from the group comes after it warned earlier this month that ferry capacity constraints due to coronavirus were making le on the island ldquounsustainable.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said the organisation has worked with CalMac to try and move from the essential leline timetable introduced during lockdown to a ldquoshoulderrsquo timetable by July . ldquoHowever, capacity challenges will remain as a result of physical distancing requirements on vessels that are required to protect public health and to ensure compliance with MCA regulations also, he added.The spokesman said CalMac will retain % capacity for ldquoturn up and go travel after consulting islanders who raised concerns over securing space for ldquofamily visits and other allowable trips."},{"url":null,"title":"leicester-becomes-first-city-go-back-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surges","story":"It comes as the rest of England prepares to ease restrictions on pubs and restaurants from Saturday ndash and on the day Boris Johnson sets out a multi-billion pound plan for Britain to recover from the pandemic.Mr Hancock told MPs that non-essential shops in Leicester will close from Tuesday and schools will shut to most pupils from Thursday.He said the easing of the lockdown planned for the rest of England on Saturday cannot happen in Leicester because of rising cases.He made the announcement in a Commons statement that came at pm, four hours after expected and following a day of talks with Leicester officials.Mr Hancock said Leicesterrsquos seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city.:A tale of two leaders: Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson during the pandemicLeicester accounts for around % of all positive cases in the country over the past week, and hospital admissions are between six and  per day rather than around one a day at other trusts, he said.He said: ldquoGiven the growing outbreak in Leicester, we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown set to take place on July  happens in Leicester.The Health Secretary advised people from Leicester to stay at home as much as they can while the local lockdown measures continue.He told MPs: ldquoHaving taken clinical advice on the actions necessary and discussed them with the local team in Leicester and Leicestershire, we have made some dficult but important decisions.ldquoWersquove decided that from tomorrow, non-essential retail will have to close and as children have been particularly impacted by this outbreak, schools will also need to close from Thursday, staying open for vulnerable children and children of critical workers as they did throughout.The risk of catching #coronavirus is much less,yoursquore  metres away from an infected person thanyoursquore  metre away.Until the number of cases in #Leicester comes down, please be extra cautious and continue to keep  metres apart from people you dont live with. pic pOTowTIXJmdash Leicester City CouncilJune , ldquoUnfortunately, the clinical advice is that the relaxation of shielding measures due on July  cannot now take place in Leicester.ldquoWe recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester.ldquoWersquoll monitor closely adhering to social distancing rules and wersquoll take further stepsthat is whatrsquos necessary.He said the measures will apply to Leicester and the surrounding conurbation including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield and promised the exact details would be published ldquoimminently.:Coronavirus: From care homes crisis to surgery and scanning backlog -

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how one company has been helped, and what support is available. vw, px\"  When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh.The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. vw, px\"  Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency.In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with £m of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.The £, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. vw, px\"  Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable.“Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.”The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest.“Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.”For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit.“There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said.“But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.”Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings.Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. , jobs in Scotand have been furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May ., claims amounting to £ million through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme up to May .%of those eligible for SEISS made a claim.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From helping to build Nightingale Hospitals to delivering essential supplies to those who are shielding, they have helped thousands of people across the country. We take a look at how one such veteran is helping out.This is not the first time former soldier Joshua Ryder has seen a pandemic close up, having volunteered to visit Sierra Leone during the West African Ebola virus outbreak. The -year-old worked in what was known as a “red zone” in Kerry Town,  miles from capital Freetown.As a member of Royal Army Medical Core, he worked as a combat medical technician, receiving awards for Top Trainee and Adult Learner of the Year.Joshua said: “We treated patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola. The symptoms are similar to those of malaria and gastroenteritis. “We triaged and tested patients to determine whether they had these or Ebola.”The West African outbreak began in , ending in Sierra Leone in .Two-and-a-half years after the first case was discovered, the outbreak resulted in more than , cases with , deaths. vw, px\"  Such was the volatility of the strain – most widespread outbreak of the disease in history – Joshua was only allowed to work in the area for  days.He said: “I loved the country. It has some beautul sights and the people are really friendly. “It was sad to see the devastation caused by the pandemic. We didn’t only focus on the pandemic. We visited orphanages and helped build something for the country.“It was moving to see the children who lost their parents to the virus.”During the coronavirus outbreak he is again working, but the environment could not be more dferent.Having left the army in , he is now a trainee nursing associate on a Midlands Partnership NHS Trust acute mental health ward in Stafford.Joshua, who is father to Tia, aged , and her -year-old sister Lola, said: “Day to day I am more involved with the physical well-being of the patients – calming them, making physical observations, doing ECGs and bloods. “I go to Keele University one day a week and am due to start my second year in September.”It was Joshua’s experiences and expertise in the army that led him to the NHS in general, and mental health in particular.He said: “I have worked in demanding conditions in ious locations around the world. I am adaptable to suit many environments and job roles.” vw, px\"  In the military he saw firsthand soldiers suffering poor mental health. One of his friends, also serving in the army, committed suicide.He said: “I entered the NHS through the Step into Health programme, which has been brilliant.“I have been able to prove myself and have had really positive feedback.“I won an award for Outstanding Impact Since Joining the NHS at the programme’s first ceremony.”Joshua is helping to treat patients through more dficult times than usual.“We are doing absolutely brilliantly,” he said. “It would be abnormal, with all the constant changes,we did not experience stress and anxiety.“We have adapted and made changes.“Here our patients have been brilliant.“We have got a good team here, a good mix of people with dferent skills. We all support each other and do everything we can for our patients.”Joshua has also been a volunteer with men’s mental health charity Men Unite, supporting males in crisis.He ran a half marathon last year to raise £ for Mental Health UK.“And this month I am running  miles, having so far raised £ for the same charity through JustGiving.” he said.Former service personnel have helped dferent communities deal with all manner of problems, making urgent deliveries of food and medicines to vulnerable people while also helping those who are shielding receive what they need.Many others have helped ensure those who need a test for the virus have been able to get one by setting up mobile testing sites, allowing them to run smoothly and safely to daily test thousands of people with symptoms.A lot of this work has required specic skills our veterans have learnt throughout years of military service.The work of these veterans goes to show the military gives you key skills, transferable to civilian le – be it healthcare, business or organisation.Veterans form an important part of our NHS workforce and, throughout COVID-, many more have come forward to support the continued fight against this pandemic.Working across a iety of roles, both on and off the frontline, the NHS has benefitted from their military expertise and experiences, invaluable at this challenging time.From redesigning hospital departments to safely supporting virus and non-virus patients, to providing care for those in Nightingale Hospitals and supporting nurses using military mental health resilience techniques, vets have once again served our country with pride.This is in addition to many who have continued to work in dedicated NHS services for ex-service personnel, such as Veterans’ Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service and Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service to ensure care and treatment remains available throughout this period, virtually or via phone. vw, px\"  Minister for Defence People and Veterans Johnny Mercer, pictured right, said: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. “We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally.

SCT was delighted to secure a £, grant from the SSE Sustainable Development Fund last month, and hopes to soon confirm the final funding package.SCT bought the site, near Bun-Sgoil Stafainn, from the Stenscholl Township and Kilmuir Estatefor £,, using a grant from the Scottish Land Fund.It followed the conclusion of the Resumption process, removing the development site from crofting tenure, which was approved by the Scottish Land Court earlier this year.SCT director Calum MacDonald said: “The progress made is a great achievement for the community. I know that the community recognises that affordable housing is long overdue.#Welcoming families in need of such accommodation, and who are very keen to live in Staffin, will be a great boost to our village.”HSCHT chief executive Ronnie MacRae said: “The health, economic and social benefits of this scheme will undoubtedly give Staffin strong foundations to build on.”Lachie MacDonald, LSHA chief executive association, added: “We are delighted that this rural mixed-use development is about to start on site. Staffin Community Trust is to be applauded for their vision and determination to drive forward this project.

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PARKING-FAIRY-POOLS-4.jpg","title":"letters mothball tourism until vaccine praise for responsible","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOn a purely local, Highland level, with Test, Track and Trace in place, there is much to commend that view.There is also a view widely supported that the Tourist Industry should be restarted.I use the phrase Test, Track and Trace because it closely illustrates what must be done.I asked VisitScotland how many tourists they expected this summer in the Highlands. They had absolutely no idea.What we can surmise is that to anyone where in the UK this looks like a great, safe, destination.It doesn’t really matter because one infected person, , could result in  being infected  days later, and, unchecked, every three days after that the number of infections doubles.If you were on a family holiday and you had very mild symptoms, would you report them, or think you had a summer cold Let us be absolutely clear that the only reason this “R” number is where it is, is because we have all been kept in our homes to stop the virus spreading.The virus is still out there.The stated defence, in fact the only defence, , against that happening is Test, Track and Trace.How do you Test, Track and Trace an itinerant population of “let’s say”  to  tourists who move their location pretty much every day I think inviting an unrestricted number of visitors to the fragile Highland communities is a huge risk.Don’t think I don’t understand the economic consequences. My we and I run a very well-regarded BB taking people from all over the world.This year we will have none.Most BBs are not going to go bust, the owners are living in their own homes.Not so with hotels. So, we need a dferent answer anyway, because the chances are the hotels are not going to make up the number of bed-nights they need to survive in the next three or four months.Both the businesses and their staff need protection.Liquidators and Receivers should be instructed, by Government, to close the business downto stop the ebb of money, and either protect them from creditors, or much better pay the creditors with Government sponsored bank loans, keeping a close record of that expenditure. Perhaps they could also pay the staff They should mothball the business waiting for the day a vaccine or a cure is found, and it can re-open safely, and be handed back to the previous owners. The owners would then be given favourable, very long-term loans to pay back the costs met by the liquidators and receivers.There will be a cost, but a cost the owners can later meet, over many years, at low or virtually zero interest rates. The Government should not foot that bill, but it could facilitate it.I do not for one micro second forget the massive and fantastic contributions to health and care workers, and those on the front line who delivered to our doors at this time.However, my respect and admiration goes to the owners and staff of tourist and hospitality businesses.The financial and mental strains needing to remain optimistic, to remain as responsible employers and to face the financial crisis that this pandemic has brought, needs some recognition.I am sure the cost to trade and business may never truly be known, but must exceed millions of pounds.To those who kept us all safe, by cancelling visitors and closing shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions at this testing time, simple words of thanks are not in any compensation for the vast loss in revenue from the sector.But I would just like to thank all those ethical and responsible businesses that did the right thing, and helping to decrease the possibility of the spread of this virus.The sacrices of owners and staff will not be forgotten, and I would urge all local people to rally round and support these businesses when it is safe to do so.Tourism and hospitality is the mainstay and leblood of our local economy, and with everyone#s help, in time it will recover.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bbc-salisbury.jpg","title":"timely salisbury series showed ordinary people doing the best in an unprecedented","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMy kids seemed to have survived this oversight in their upbringing although in high school it apparently caused some surprise among their pals.I should add it is not all books by candlelight. We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hope-and-faith-scaled.jpg","title":"skye youngsters clock up more than 10000 miles for zambian school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Portree High students were challenged to clock up the miles and between them run or walk the distance between Skye and Lusaka, Zambia – home of the Hope and Faith Community School.Over the last two months pupils and teachers have completed , miles, easily surpassing their original ,-mile target.Now the youngsters have been challenged to add a further , miles before the term ends, and to add to the £ that has been brought in for the project.A donation of £ will pay for school meals for all pupils at the school, which has long established links to Skye.The school began in  with two pupils, but has since grown to help provide education – and a daily meal – for over  children on the outskirts of the Zambian capital..There have been exchange visits between the schools, and Portree teachers Neil Burrows and Tony Breen had been due to head to Africa at Easter, with two Zambian teachers ing to Skye in May.It is now hoped the exchange can go ahead in .Mr Breen, Portree’s deputy head, said the challenge had been a positive one – both for the charity and for the health and well-being of the pupils during lockdown.He added: “We are very pleased with the balance of work and wellbeing for the majority of our pupils.“Looking at our provision of online learning in comparison with the rest of Scotland, most parents have been happy with the dferent ways in which pupils have been learning # from watching teachers pre-made videos, google meets and chats, online quizzes, and even DIY science practicals.”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions.

A sapling sprouted and went on to stand there for over  years.It#s quite a tale and one which the locals around here love to tell, said Rev Benson.We#d be hopeful of finding out more about the history of it now it#s fallen.We could see on CCTV that the tree fell about half five in the morning. It was very calm so there was no storm damage as such.It#s now resting across some gravestones so we need to be careful about moving it.We had a tree surgeon come up and look at it and apparently the roots had gone. Unfortunately that#s it. It would have happened sooner or later and we#re thankful it happened when it did, with no-one around. It was just the weight of the tree that finally brought it over.But there#s no way we want to turn it into firewood, we#re much too fond of it for that.Once we examine the condition of the wood we#ll be looking into doing something with it. The trunk itself is quite a size and we want to use it to create something substantial for local people to remember it by. It deserves to be preserved.Rev Benson is now hopeful that a study of the site might bring some answers as to whether there#s any truth in the legend.There#s interest from an archaeologist who will be coming down to have a look and seethere#s anything underneath where the tree stood, said Rev Benson.Now that the tree is down we can let experts take a really good look at it, date it properly and seeindeed it did grow from the chestnuts in the pocket of a Spanish Armada sailor who may still lie beneath it.In the meantime, Rev Benson has urged people not to come along to the graveyard to salvage a piece of history. The graveyard is covered by CCTV and numerous people have already ignored the tape around the fallen tree to take wood and cuttings.We cannot stress enough that the tree is not safe, he added.We don#t want to close the graveyard, butpeople continue to ignore the warnings, that is unfortunately the action we will have to take. Anyone ignoring the tape is personally liable for any further damage to yourself or the gravestones, so please be careful.Belfast Most ReadPictured: The man due in court over sick video about Noah DonohoeNoah Donohoe#s heartbroken mum always told her #special# son he would change the world Loyalist band parade to go ahead despite warning it will breach lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Groups of up to  people allowed to meet outdoors, Foster announcesNoah always in our hearts: Tragic end to mystery which has haunted country all week as teen found in Belfast drain complex,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I realised it had to be his.Ms Crooks, who attended the north Belfast vigils for Noah on Sunday, immediately called the police at pm. A neighbour#s CCTV would later show Noah walking around the back of the Northwood Road, where there is access to a storm drain, which may or may not have been locked.They realised this must have been where Noah was last seen alive, she said.I#d obviously started a chain of events because then they were then able to find his clothes and helmet.Then the search and rescue teams appeared. They were here most of the night searching the area around my house, trying to work out where he went next.As a child who grew up here, I was asking myself #where would I have gone  What would I have done#  I just couldn#t work it out.She also revealed that she became very emotional when police officers called to collect Noah#s bicycle.When they took the bike away on Tuesday afternoon, I burst into tears, she said.I#ve had to take comfort from the fact that me coming across that bike brought the rescue team here to start the search. If I hadn#t brought them here, to this storm drain and this river, maybe they would never have found him.Ms Crooks, a classroom assistant, said she didn#t need to watch any of the news reports because she watched the search unfold in my front garden, my street and in my community.She also told how she met Noah#s aunt Niamh in her back garden and she said they would always be welcome at her home, should they wish to visit.Niamh and others came down to help in the search at one point and had made their own sandwiches, she said. Pastor Brian Madden, who was comforting the family, said #put those sandwiches away, we have got hot food for you, and tea and coffee#. As Brian later said, they didn#t want to encroach on anyone#s generosity.Ms Crooks said that, as a mother of two young boys, she could only imagine how Noah#s mother must be feeling at the loss of her son.You just believe your children are always going to be there with you, she said.Unfortunately that#s now not the case for Fiona. How she#s going to get over this, I just don#t know. I#m heartbroken for her and her family.It is still not known why Noah entered the drain, but police have said they do not believe there was any foul play.The funeral will take place at St Patrick#s Church in north Belfast at am on Wednesday.On Monday the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Frank McCoubrey, opened an online book of condolence in memory of Noah.He said: People from across the city have been deeply affected by the loss of young Noah, and their thoughts and prayers are with Noah#s mother and wider family circle at this devastating time.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandPrivate funeral to be held for schoolboy Noah Donohoe A private funeral will be held for tragic schoolboy Noah Donohoe on Wednesday, his family has announced.

He couldn#t have done it without the support from Mencap. The staff at Mencap have been brilliant to us and are always there for support. We have got to meet so many other families who were in a similar situation and could relate to what we were going through, which really helped. The workshops and training courses were a great help to me and my family.She said the latest milestone came after weeks of practice by her son.His feet never left the ground, but he was so determined to do it. Then suddenly his feet lted, and he was so excited, she said. He loves jumping now. We decided we would like to help raise as much as we can for Mencap so they can go on supporting other families like ours, and to also say thank you to Mencap for everything that they have done for us so far.The Covid- pandemic has meant the Children#s Centre has had to pause face to face support for families and provide as many services as possible online.Margaret Kelly, director of Mencap Northern Ireland, said: I just want to say a huge thank you to Lucius and Joanne for fundraising for Mencap. It means so, so much to us that our families so value our services that they are willing to fundraise on top of everything  they do.She added: Our extraordinary teams are working extremely hard in challenging circumstances to help many children and adults with a learning disability and their families in need of support during this dficult time. Lucius#s jumping is a very special #Move it for Mencap# challenge. It is really wonderful that Lucius and Joanne are helping us to transform the lives of other children with a learning disability and their families to help them build independent and fulfilling lives.Approximately , people in Northern Ireland have a learning disability, with Mencap also providing support to their families and carers with a helpline, online support services and lobbying.For further information on how to donate or take part in the fundraising campaign, visit northernirelaned.mencap.org.ukBelfast Most ReadPictured: The man due in court over sick video about Noah DonohoeNoah Donohoe#s heartbroken mum always told her #special# son he would change the world Loyalist band parade to go ahead despite warning it will breach lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Groups of up to  people allowed to meet outdoors, Foster announcesNoah always in our hearts: Tragic end to mystery which has haunted country all week as teen found in Belfast drain complex,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast . The Saintfield Road cameras had signicant downtime throughout .The number of detections at mobile camera sitesincreased by % between  and .This followed an increase in deployments of safety camera vans, resulting in more detections.The , other cases were detected by #average speed# cameras.Inspector Leech said everyone had a responsibility to make our roads safer.She added: Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

There were definitely lots of botched jobs done during lockdown, she joked.We are high-fiving the women who didn#t do the botched colouring.Mrs Grufferty said the last number of weeks had been hectic as she prepared for reopening, with a range of new safety measures implemented, including screens and personal protective equipment. It#s been very expensive, she continued. It#s crippling for a business when they#ve not been making money but for the safety of my staff and also the customers that come in here, it was a no-brainer, we had to take that hit and just put that in.Realistically you can#t run your business and make sure everyone is protected and make sure your staff are protected without stuff like this so it was really dficult, but it has to be done.She said customers would notice many changes, including an appointment-only system.We also can#t give them a hug now, she added.Mrs Grufferty#s sister-in-law Kathleen was one of the first back into one of the salon#s chairs yesterday morning.I#m very excited to be back and feel normal again, she said.I was in at am this morning, it was great - one of the first.Bryant Jordan was also there early.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Public services will be held in many local churches today for the first time in months. There will be many restrictions in place to protect worshippers from possible coronavirus infection. Catholic Bishop of Derry, Doanl McKeown, welcomed the resumption of services but urged people to take care. “I hope that we have learned lessons about le since we were locked down in March,” he said. “This is a time to cherish those lessons and not to allow the insights to be lost in a tsunami of going back to the future. googletag.cmd.push “We have seen what has happened in those places where there has been a stampede to forget we escaped from worse consequences through self-discipline. “It will take many people time to overcome the fear of mixing again. “We want our churches to be places where people can share the infectious good news of the Gospel – but avoid being Corona-infected through selfishness and carelessness. “We have to begin cautiously. “In all areas of human le, short term gain can lead to long-term pain.” The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Andrew Forster, has also appealed to parishioners to be patient and understanding as their churches get ready for the resumption of public worship. googletag.cmd.push “Although in Ireland, at the moment, the virus seems very much under control – which we’re so thankful for – we know the virus is still there,” Bishop Andrew said. “We’ve been given the freedom to meet again [from Monday], but we know that with freedom comes responsibility. “At the moment, going back to church places a lot of responsibility on you and on me, on select vestries and on clergy, and on all those who will attend churches because we’ve got to follow all the public health guidelines and we’ve got to follow the guidelines that the Church of Ireland has put together for that. “I really welcome the opportunity to be back at church but I want you to know that there’s no set date by which this may happen, because select vestries – and clergy in particular – have to make sure that in their parishes it’s right and it’s appropriate and it’s safe to open, and that’ll take time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

While I missed my family and friends and others who have played a signicant part in my le, I am glad that they could watch from afar via the live-stream.The service began with a welcome and call to worship by the Moderator of Down Presbytery, Rev Dario Leal, minister of First Ballynahinch Presbyterian.During the service, which included three pre-recorded items of worship by members Second Saintfield, Brian McKee a representative elder to the Presbytery from First Ballynahinch, read from  Timothy :-.The sermon, based on the reading from First Timothy, was delivered by the Rev David Hyndman, minister of Magherahamlet and Spa Presbyterian Churches, who convened the Second Saintfield vacancy.Those present for the service and others watching online from over  separate locations also heard short pre-recorded speeches after the service had concluded.One was a message of welcome from Stanley McFarland, Clerk of Session of Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church.The Presbytery Moderator described the installation and ordination service as ldquodferent, but a special evening.He added: ldquoJohn received and accepted a call from Second Saintfield on the Monday before lockdown. While it was frustrating for all concerned that his ordination and installation could not take place in Saintfield due to the restrictions in place, we were delighted and relieved when the offer came from the PCIrsquos General Secretary inviting us to use Assembly Buildings.ldquoIt now means that John can commence his ministry for which he trained and has been called to.

We’ll not be doing congregational singing or communion as we had done previously. “We need to communicate to our flock exactly what they’ll be coming to, so that we can manage expectations. We are trying to provide something to feed the soul and not entirely alienate a church-going population who are used to their own way of doing things. “We will rely on people’s goodwill a lot. People are hungry to go back to church. They realise that it can’t be the same, just as they realise that going to Sainsbury’s isn’t the same as it used to be.”He added: “Churches would have a fair number of older, faithful congregational members. We know that they will come as soon as the doors are opened. Whether they should is an entirely dferent question. So we need to make sure we are doing things as safely as we can for the folks that are going to come.”During lockdown the church harnessed modern technologies to hold Bible study groups, prayer meetings and record an online Sunday service.Rev McConnell said: “I would say a fair percentage of those things will continue even after lockdown really eases. We’ve found it has opened up new channels of communications for us, people have tuned in who haven’t been to church for years.”Presbyterian churches are also putting safety first with the majority targeting a resumption of worship from mid-July to early August.Cregagh Presbyterian Church was among the first to announce it would be holding a service on Sunday, July .Rev Trevor Gribben, general secretary of the PCI said: “We look forward to being able to meet again, with our brothers and sisters in Christ, while ensuring that the required health and safety principles are met.” He said any decision when to resume services would be a local decision taken by the minister and elders together.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They were beautul photographs of a beautul boy. A boy with an entire le ahead of him. I happened to have a copy of Dr Seuss’s Oh, The Places You’ll Go! beside meand was immediately drawn to these lines:You have brains in your head.You have feet in your shoes.Floral tributes left for Noah Donohoe on the gates of his school, St Malachy’s College \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...You can steer yourselfany direction you choose.You’re on your own. And you know what you know.And YOU are the guy who’ll decide where to go.Noah will never have the chance to live those lines.Even though I know that over , young people between the ages of  and  are reported missing every year in Northern Ireland I consoled myself that the overwhelming majority, more than %, are found within two days . Yet every one of those hours is like a letime for those waiting at home.And even though I had never heard of Noah before last Monday I found myself checking news sites every couple of hours to seehe had turned up safe and well. Judging by the traction on social media it was clear that hundreds of thousands of others were doing exactly the same thing.Isn’t it extraordinary that with so much  going on right now – particularly with the pandemic and fears of another wave – so many us were thinking about Noah  It’s that concern, compassion and sheer hope of a good outcome that really touched me. Hundreds of people out looking for him. Tens of thousands tweeting and retweeting his photograph. Who knows how many parents giving their own children an extra hug or how many older children thinking for the first time that this could have been their own friend or sibling. The very palpable sense of collective grief when the news came through that a body had been found.I couldn’t understand why I was so deeply moved. So gut-wrenchingly upset. I didn’t know Noah. I don’t know his mum or any member of his family. I don’t know anyone that knew him. And yet I was still wiping my eyes on Saturday morning. Looking at my own childrenand wondering how I would cope – how I would even begin to cope –I knew I would never see one of them again. Looking again at his photograph was an almost unbearable experience: yet I owed him that look. I owed him those moments of reflection because he has touched my le and my emotions.I think Gail Walker summed up brilliantly the collective feeling: ‘The ceaseless rain in Belfast tonight seems apt a sad city mourning a fine, handsome and brilliant boy. Let’s draw a scrap of comfort from how even in our petty isions we came together to search without flagging how in the face of senseless tragedy we mourn as one.’ Gail is right: caring about the whereabouts and safety of a boy unknown to almost all of us tells us something about ourselves.On his way to and from school, or just getting on with his everyday le, hundreds, maybe thousands of us will have seen him without noticing him. Just another teenage boy. Today he is remembered as a very specic teenage boy. A teenage boy getting on with his everyday le last Sunday: but who never came home again. And there isn’t a mum or dad in Northern Ireland who doesn’t want to go and give his mum a hug right now. There is nothing worse than the loss of a child. We have lost four through miscarriage and there is rarely a day when we don’t think about them. The smallest thing can bring them to mind. There is a song which still reduces me to tears because it’s what we played when we cremated our miscarried -week-old son, Conan. That sort of grief is crippling but, to be perfectly frank, I’m pretty sure it couldn’t even begin to compare with the grief of losing a child you have loved and looked after for  years.I think that’s why the story of a missing child will always dominate headlines: nearly all of us are parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles or friends. We know how the loss would hit us. And while few of us could put ourselves in the shoes of those who have lost a child, there’s not one of us isn’t aware of the hammer-blow such a loss would be. My -year-old, Lilah, walked into the room just as I wrote that line. I felt a welling in my eyes. I can’t imagine le without her. I’ll finish with Tom Krause’s poem about the death of his son, Fingerprints:Your fingerprints are on my heart.Fingerprints that teach me about caring.Fingerprints that teach me about love.Fingerprints that teach me about courage.Fingerprints that teach me about hope.Fingerprints that bring me closer to my loved ones.Fingerprints that bring me closer to myself.In the time I cared for you my whole le changed – never to be the same again.All this from tiny fingerprints that touch my heart.You will live in my heart forever – never to be forgotten.I will always love you.You are my child.I think some of Noah’s fingerprints are on us right now. He has managed to touch us all. And in a world which is too often cold, brutal and cynical it’s actually heartening to know how much the le of one boy can bring us together.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In the end, police here were less indulgent of such breaches than forces in many other places, including much of England.Increasingly social distancing is not observed in other situations, such as after a death. This is all the more painful for those grieving people who do still try to observe the rules.Lockdown has lasted for almost three months and it is perhaps surprising it was adhered to so widely for so long. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Hairdressers and hotels will be back early next month.It is highly regrettable that the safestof them all, theof schools, is not now happening until the end of August. There should be an inquiry at the end of this crisis into the impact on education of such a prolonged closure.When the schools do , it needs to be a full opening, as opposed to a rotating one that could mean schools are not back to normal until well into . There is much lost time to make up compared to those countries in Europe where schools have already been back months.To call for a faster exit from lockdown is not to say all will be fine. Other nations have exited only to suffer new Covid outbreaks. That will have to be dealt with cluster by cluster, locally. Masks can help theto normality because the wearer helps protect other people .Outbreaks cannot be reason to stay in lockdown for ever.

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy

Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a
