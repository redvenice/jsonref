Countless national leaders over recent years have brushed aside China\u0027s appalling human rights behaviour in the blind pursuit of trade deals with Beijing. There has been shamefully scant attention paid to how the Communist regime brutally represses the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, not to mention its continuing mistreatment of Tibet. It is also a country that beyond its borders has aggressively laid claim to 90 per cent of the South China Sea – a vital region with large gas and oil reserves through which trade shipments in goods totalling £4billion pass every year. What\u0027s more, when a United Nations tribunal ruled in 2016 that China had no legal basis to its claim to control the waters or resources of this region, Beijing simply rejected its ruling. Thanks to Project Kow-Tow, the UK\u0027s annual trade deficit with China is £22.1billion. But we are not alone in being in hock to Beijing. For China has racked up a global trade surplus of £339billion. Distressingly, the West has watched as many key areas of production have moved to China. The recent debate about giving tele­coms giant Huawei a mega-contract on 5G networks in Britain and deals for China to help run our new nuclear power stations exemplify how dependent we all are on Beijing. Whereas there used to be ten non-Chinese companies which might have been able to compete with Huawei (which is bankrolled by the state-run Bank of China), there are now only three: Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung. It doesn\u0027t stop there. The vast majority of our mobile phones, including their microprocessors, are made in China. One successful entrepreneur involved in security products told me it was nigh on impossible to secure good business in China as companies there either undercut their bid or, if they were allowed to succeed, the Chinese often stole their technology.And now, the coronavirus issue. It is reported that the Chinese authorities delayed informing the world about the severity of the outbreak. Worse, Li Wenliang, 33, a hospital doctor in Wuhan who tried to warn about the virus, was silenced by Beijing. He was ordered to attend a police station and told he had \u0027severely disturbed the social order\u0027, and that he would be brought to justice if he continued \u0027this illegal activity\u0027. Soon afterwards, Dr Li died from the virus he had tried to warn against. Other brave voices were gagged. Dr Xie Linka, a cancer specialist at Wuhan Union Hospital, posted a message on social media, warning people not to go to the South China Seafood Market because some were \u0027suffering from pneumonia of an unknown cause (similar to SARS)\u0027. She was immediately summoned by the Public Security Bureau and told not to \u0027spread rumours\u0027 and false information. As a result of Beijing\u0027s cover-up and delay, global health experts are convinced the rest of the world had insufficient time to prepare for the pandemic, which means the effect of the outbreak has most likely been worse. The brutal truth is that China seems to flout the normal rules of behaviour in every area of life – from healthcare to trade and from currency manipulation to internal repression. For too long, nations have lamely kow-towed to China in the desperate hope of wining trade deals. But once we get clear of this terrible pandemic, it is imperative that we all rethink that relationship and put it on a much more balanced and honest basis. In the recent past, there has been one rule for China and another for the rest of us. Whatever else, that must never be allowed to happen again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ac6dedb0afbde28f03dc6c455869aea83ad7aa/0_263_4782_2869/master/4782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6ab4bf3c5869c9b29a712a7b7dc95a","title":"italys delivery drivers on lockdown photo essay","story":"In quarantine in Italy, Filippo Venturi turned his camera on the people providing a vital lifeline outside his front doorOn a locked-down Saturday night, Filippo Venturi came down the stairs of his apartment block in Forlì, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, to collect his pizza delivery. But before the rider left, he asked something they probably weren’t expecting: “Can I take your picture?”Venturi, 39, began studying photography 11 years ago, and has since documented sport, theatre events and social phenomena. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, he has been photographing delivery riders. Speaking down the phone from his home, where he, his partner and their son have been quarantined for two weeks, he tells me how he started to worry about the riders, coming into contact with stranger after stranger, while providing an essential service to those who can afford to self-isolate. As he started ordering more deliveries, he asked each rider – from a safe distance – about their lives under coronavirus.Most told him they weren’t worried, because they take precautions, as do customers. But 23-year-old Andrea, delivering sushi, wasn’t so sure. “I’m not calm,” he told Venturi. “Even if I take all the precautions, people tend to touch you, to take risks – they assume neither of you are infected. But I could be, or they could be. How do I know that they’re not in quarantine?”Venturi tells me he was struck by both the lack of consideration given to riders’ health, and their lack of choice when it came to doing the job. Davide, 25, was laid off when the restaurant he worked for closed down his second job as a personal trainer has also been terminated. Delivering burgers to make ends meet, Davide hasn’t been given a mask or gloves. “If they want them, they have to buy them themselves,” Venturi says. “Before the crisis, they cost one or two euros each – now they cost €20 or €30. And it’s not as if they can wear them for days and days.”Naturally, the lockdown made some interviews difficult. While most people were happy to talk, Venturi says, a driver called Antonio would only tell him, “I work in black.” Why? “I think it was his way of explaining that he couldn’t tell me anything else. The police roam the streets, making sure anyone who is out has a valid reason. I think he was worried that being photographed and interviewed wasn’t a good enough reason.” Delivery riders have witnessed the multiple ways people deal with their anxieties about contagion.Simone, 32, brought Venturi breakfast from a nearby coffee bar. The venue had always delivered pizza in the evening, but expanded their hours to deliver from 9am to 10pm. He reported that one customer laid out kitchen towels on the floor outside the door, and asked him to place the bag on top. “Perhaps that’s a little excessive,” Venturi says, “but taking it from his hand would mean standing closer than a metre.” Simone wears a mask and always keeps a metre away from a customer, so he’s not very worried. His main fear is that the situation could get worse. “I fear that the government might also consider stopping home deliveries,” he says.An unexpected upside was shared by 19-year-old Lucian. Generally, people do not tip in Italy now, in an effort to avoid touching notes and coins, customers are telling him to keep the change.“So he’s making more money, and that’s better for him, but the reason is sad,” Venturi says. “They’re not being generous – they’re afraid of him.”At the time of writing, the mortality rate for Covid-19 in Italy is the highest in the world, in part because the population is older. But Venturi is concerned that many younger people don’t seem to grasp that they, too, are potentially at risk.Alessandro, 21, told Venturi: “I’m calm when I work. I’m more worried about my band. We have an album coming out and we’re supposed to do a European tour in the late summer. I worry that everything will be cancelled.”The photographer says a lot of older people are frustratingly complacent, too: “They often think they’re safe if they don’t have cardiac or respiratory problems.”Though the job lacks the hero status afforded health workers and firefighters, Venturi points out that delivery riders have also risked their health so that others can stay safe and fed. Their lives might be tough or precarious in normal circumstances currently, they are even more so. “They bring food to people who are staying safe in their homes, but that puts them at greater risk. And they in turn risk taking it home and passing it on to family.” Why shouldn’t they keep the change?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0814345af234de0659b1083e7836a90d04294451/0_1513_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a5fabf6d550a6bfea908be1bf52ccf","title":"the big picture on the road in post ceaucescu romania","story":"An odyssey around remote parts of central and eastern Europe led Fabio Ponzio to this incongruous sightBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, Italian photographer Fabio Ponzio would look at a map of Europe and find his eyes always drawn to the east, to its “mysterious names, inscrutable frontiers and roads that ran on into unknown, prohibited lands”. It seemed to him that the iron curtain was “the ision between the conscious and the unconscious mind of Europe”.He first travelled across that dreamlike frontier in 1987, two years before revolutions reunited the continent. After the wall came down, over the course of a couple of decades, he drove determinedly through all the remote territories from which he had been excluded, with a tent and a stove and a sleeping bag in the back of his car, along with three Nikon cameras and 100 rolls of film. He slept in woods or in the homes of people he met. Once, in the mountains of Albania, the villagers told him that he was the first foreigner they had seen since two Italian soldiers fleeing the armistice of 1943.His pictures from those years – of weddings and funerals, of drunks and pilgrims, the homeless of the cities and the rural poor – caught cultures in the hinterland after communism and before consumerism. That period, as the hope of liberation gave way to endemic uncertainty, is the subject of his book East of Nowhere. Ponzio’s camera was drawn to incongruity. He took this picture in Romania in 1997, eight years on from the fall of Ceaucescu. The international licence plates and the open road stretching out beyond the mountains might promise new freedoms, but the sheep in the back of the car root this image in a stranger, older more unstable kind of reality.

Four or so years later, Shakespeare wrote the play considered by many to be his greatest work, giving its tragic hero a variation of his dead son’s name. Almost four centuries later still, Maggie O’Farrell was studying Hamlet at school and learned of the boy Hamnet, whose life has been little more than a footnote in his father’s biography. The seed of curiosity planted 30 years ago has grown into her finest novel yet a reimagining of Hamnet’s death and the long-lasting ripples it sent through his family.But the title is slightly misleading. Though the novel opens with Hamnet, its central character and beating heart is the boy’s mother, whom O’Farrell calls Agnes. Names are significant in this book when Agnes eventually sees the version of her son’s name on a London playbill, she feels he has been stolen from her a second time. Meanwhile, the most famous character in the novel goes unnamed he is variously “her husband”, “the father”, “the Latin tutor”. He is allowed very little direct speech. This deliberate omission frees the narrative of all the freight of association that his name carries even Stratford is rarely mentioned explicitly, with the author instead naming inidual streets and houses to root her story in its location.All this has the effect of focusing the attention on the everyday, domestic life of this family, who could be any family. Indeed, in their small local sphere it is Agnes who is the celebrity, known in the town for being unconventional, free-spirited, a gifted herbalist who trails rumours of other, stranger gifts. O’Farrell’s Agnes is a woman whose origins merge into a particularly English kind of folklore – “There used to be a story in these parts about a girl who lived at the edge of a forest” – harking back to a deep connection between humans and landscape, with echoes of tales such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.“There were creatures in there who resembled humans – wood-dwellers, they were called – who walked and talked, but had never set foot outside the forest, had lived all their lives in its leafish light, its encircling branches, its wet and tangled interior.”Agnes herself is, in the eyes of her neighbours, a creature descended from myth they regard her with a mixture of awe and wariness. When the young Latin tutor engaged to teach her half-brothers first spies her from the window of the schoolroom, striding out of the forest with a kestrel on her wrist, he thinks she is a boy. O’Farrell’s great skill throughout the book is to treat obviously “Shakespearean” themes, such as this kind of gender-blurring or the affinity between boy and girl twins, with subtlety, making them almost tangential when they occur in the playwright’s own life. Hamnet and his twin sister, Judith, have a trick they play on people: “to exchange places and clothes, leading people to believe that each was the other”.This is not O’Farrell’s first foray into historical fiction – her 2006 novel The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox was set partly in the 1930s – but it is quite unlike anything she has written before. There is an elliptical, dreamlike quality to her prose in Hamnet that, though not obviously steeped in 16th-century language, is essential to creating a world that feels at once wholly tangible and somehow otherworldly, as if the membrane between the natural and supernatural was more porous then. The depth of her research is evident on every page. Anyone who has visited Shakespeare’s birthplace will recognise her descriptions of his former home, but O’Farrell plunges the reader into the vivid life of the house, with its smells of a glover’s workshop, the heat and bustle of a cookhouse, the physical effort of planting a garden or twisting out newly washed sheets.At its heart, though, this is a book about grief, and the means by which people find their way through it. The scene in which Agnes washes and lays out the body of her dead son is devastating (he must be buried quickly, for fear the plague will spread – an aspect of the story that has gained accidental pertinence). There is great tenderness, too, in her reimagining of the relationship between Agnes and her husband, which endured such long absences. “It’s as if her mother needs London, and all that he does there, to rub off him before she can accept him back,” Judith observes.Hamnet is evidence that there are always new stories to tell, even about the most well-known historical figures. It also confirms O’Farrell as an extraordinarily versatile writer, with a profound understanding of the most elemental human bonds – qualities also possessed by a certain former Latin tutor from Stratford.• Hamnet by Maggie O’Farrell is published by Tinder Press (£20).

Having decided to devote her thesis to the way that fishing shapes a community, she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall – which is where she met Don, the skipper of a rusty old trawler called the Filadelfia. Would Don consider taking her out in his boat, so that she might stand, as it were, in “the same wellies” as his crew? Somewhat to her amazement – women are supposed to bring bad luck at sea – he said that he would, and so it was that one evening in 2017 she found herself rounding Land’s End just as the sun was about to set, her stomach a tight knot of nerves, her eyes already red from the salt-licked wind. “I’m someone who doesn’t think too hard about things before I do them,” she says. “I seem not to be very cautious I get overexcited. But that day, yes, I was nervous. I was very scared of seasickness. Not so much of being sick itself, but of it being so bad that I would be useless and they would have to take me home. I didn’t want to do anything to jeopardise their trip I knew that would cost them a lot of money.”In the end, she was sick, but only once. “You start yawning,” she says. “And that’s when you know you’re going to go, and you don’t want the men to see because it’s such a sign of weakness.” Most of the time, however, she was able to manage her constant, raging nausea with a combination of seasickness pills and hard work among other things, she learned to gut every kind of fish, holding the gasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands even as she struggled properly to stand upright. Life on a trawler is hard, the days long and tough and extremely cold, and thanks to this she found that she was always hungry for the vast meals the crew cooked and ate down below, sickness or no sickness.As for the things that tied her to the land – her parents, her friends – she learned not to think of them. It embarrasses her now to remember the moment when, not long after they had set sail, she asked Don for the Filadelfia’s wifi code. (“Do you know how much that costs at sea?” he told her, with a laugh.) Her phone useless in the pocket of her oilskins, she found that time deepened at sea. She learned to speak a new language, one at once both more reticent than the English spoken on land and yet, in some ways, more open, too. In the wheelhouse, talking to Don or one of the other men while they were on watch – on a trawler, you’re potentially only ever seconds from catastrophe hit an old anchor or some submarine cables, and the vessel can easily capsize – she learned to listen to the long, meditative gaps between sentences, spaces that allowed words to “expand and drift” in ways that rendered them altogether more meaningful.Did the world of the Filadelfia feel very male? Was it unnerving to sleep in her bunk – its size and shape made her think of a coffin – alongside all those snoring, hairy, briny men? “I didn’t especially experience it like that, no,” she says. “They were older than me they’re family guys, and their women are very strong. The biggest fishing family in Newlyn, the Stevensons, has a matriarch at the head of it. I never felt unsafe, though now and then I would ask one of them: would you say that to a man? But I did want to prove myself a bit. I was never going just to sit there and make notes and take photographs.” Ash studied English at Oxford, and Don made her think of Singleton, the old sailor on Joseph Conrad’s Narcissus: the men who could understand Singleton’s silences were, she recalled, those mariners who “knew how to exist beyond the pale of life”. Staring out into the blue-black, she realised on that first night aboard the Filadelfia that she and its crew had now themselves moved beyond the pale: a confined, almost monastic existence, and yet an unencumbered, roaming one, too – and so began what she thinks of today as the richest and most vast experience of her life so far.Ash’s eight-day stint on the Filadelfia forms the spine of her first book, Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town artfully, she returns to it again and again, to the point where you come to believe she must always have known she would one day put the experience between hard covers. But this was, she insists, never her plan. Her thesis complete, she was interning at the Times Literary Supplement when a publisher spotted a piece she had written about a trip she took on another trawler, the Crystal Sea – that publisher asked to meet her, and duly gave her a book deal (she now works for an educational charity). And in person, it’s impossible not to take her at her word. I’m amazed and slightly shocked when she reveals that she spent, in total, just three and a half months in Newlyn something about her book – the intimacy of the encounters it describes the epic quality of her account of life on the Filadelfia – leads you to imagine that she must have lived there for a year at least, and possibly much longer.She and I meet in Penzance. She has been in Newlyn all weekend, seeing old friends and mooching around, and when I get off the train on a bright Monday afternoon, she pitches up in a long coat and with a ravishing new pixie haircut looking like someone who is slightly drunk on fresh air. For both of us, London and Covid-19 suddenly seem very far away. We can breathe. St Michael’s Mount casts its usual spell out in the bay (24 hours later, the National Trust will announce that it is now closed to the public). The Jubilee Pool, Penzance’s celebrated art deco saltwater lido, looks strangely inviting even in mid-March. The people, mostly retired, that we pass as we walk along the promenade are unhurried and smiling.Still, it’s important not to take things at face value. Ash has a family connection to this part of Cornwall she spent her childhood holidays in Lelant, near St Ives, where her mother’s side of the family has lived for generations. But if those times were idyllic – her mother, a former actor who once appeared in Poldark, was always encouraging her to let her imagination run wild as they walked on the beach – Cornwall has, of course, a darker side: chiaroscuro shades that she learned to see (“another way of looking”) more clearly during her time in Newlyn.In Newlyn, Ash carefully points out the sights to me. Here is the fish market, where she once spent a morning unpacking catch after catch, her fingers so cold she could not feel them (stored in ice, the lemon sole were the hardest to break apart) here is the Swordfish Inn, AKA the Swordy, where she used to drink with her new fishermen friends (it was once ranked second in a TV documentary entitled The Toughest Pubs in Britain) and here is the little house where she lodged with a couple she came to think of as her  angels, Denise and Lofty (Denise worked in a fishmongers Lofty is a ship chandler). Finally, we go past Newlyn’s lifeboat station and out on to the pontoons in the harbour to look at the boats. The creaking Filadelfia has, she says, finally given up the ghost, but there are two trawlers here that look just like it: rough, industrial vessels with huge derricks from which their nets drag. In her book, she likens these boats to prehistoric birds with skeletal wings, and as we gaze at them, clanking and inhospitable, it isn’t hard to see why.Brexit is mentioned only rarely in her book its politics are deliberately oblique. But the subject came up a lot while she was in Newlyn. The first trawler she went on, the Crystal Sea, was part of the Brexit flotilla that sailed into London in 2016 (organised by Fishing for Leave, it sailed from Ramsgate to Westminster, demanding that Britain take back control of its waters under the common fisheries policy, European fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds up to 12 nautical miles from the coasts of member states). “Its crew spoke about ‘our seas’, which always felt bonkers to me. Fish migrate, and when you’re out there… the sea is vast. It feels as though it belongs to everyone. But we had good debates. They were kind of vital for me. They made me see that arguments about waters are very complicated I stopped assuming that a certain point of view was right.”And what about her? In what ways did her experiences at sea change her? She isn’t, she says, a particularly squeamish person apart from when she was dealing with rays, a fish that seemed to be somehow more fiercely alive than the sole and the monkfish, and which could only be killed with a stab to the heart, she didn’t mind the gutting and the filleting. She was learning new skills, and there was something so unexpectedly beautiful, she thinks, even about their arrabbiata-sauce coloured insides: “The brilliant thing is that every time I have fish now, I think about the supply chain. It has made me more appreciative, knowing that men are out there, risking their lives.” Most people are, she thinks, very distant from their shrink-wrapped food: far too distant: “I have the sense, living in London, of so rarely being involved in real things.”Her time in Newlyn also taught her to think, both as a city person and one determined to be more green, in a more nuanced way about the environmental issues around fishing. “People say we have got to get rid of the trawlers, because of the damage they do to the seabed. But I know that doing so will affect the lives of a whole community – though it’s a relief when you hear about the smaller boats: there is a future that could be greener.” British people need to start eating more hake, she thinks: “We catch so much of it.” (The fishermen of St Ives, incidentally, refer to themselves as Hakes, while the Newlyn men, with whom they are fiercely rivalrous, like to call the north coasters the Scaly Backs.)But she does not want to romanticise. As her book makes plain, fishing takes its effects on mental health some men come to have issues with alcohol (though it is strictly forbidden at sea), and depression is a problem, too. “I hope that I show the limits of close community, as well as its benefits,” she says. “I’ve had my own problems with depression in the past, and it was good to talk to the fishermen about their mental health. I recognised the disassociation they sometimes felt – it’s how they survive – and how scary it can sometimes be.” A fisherman’s life is one of extremes: his sense of jeopardy swiftly replaced by one of celebration when he arrives home safely and hits the pub. As one of the men, Nathan, once told her: when a fisherman is at home, he’s always counting the days until he leaves and when he’s at sea, he’s always counting the days until he’ll be back.On her last night on the Filadelfia, Don cooked (how on earth did he do it?) one of the best meals she has ever eaten – a huge roast dinner of potatoes, mashed swede, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, parsnips and beef – after which the crew, in spite of their bloated bellies, landed the best catch of their trip, the derricks moaning loudly as they pulled up the immense haul of prized turbot and cuttlefish (“like waiting for lottery numbers to come up,” Ash thought, as she waited to see what the nets had brought). But after this, the mood changed. No one slept much on that last night.Fishermen call it “channelling”: when thoughts of home, and all the people in it, swim through your mind all night, waking you repeatedly. One of the men tells her that the term is drawn from the word “channel” in its spiritual sense: the conveying of a spirit from another world to this one. (The link between these two worlds is the boat.) And she came to understand that it’s a necessary process. The next morning, as the Filadelfia approached the harbour and a mobile phone signal was once again possible, the boat became simply another place of work rather than, as it was just moments before, the only world that mattered. And now it was the land that seemed suddenly mysterious: a single, unbroken entity she had found herself unable to imagine while she was at sea. Arrival was at once both exhilarating, and anticlimactic. Only when she came face to face with Lofty again did she realise how rancid she smelled – and how little her stench had mattered to her until that moment.Ash’s book comes into the world garlanded with praise. William Dalrymple has called her a new star of nonfiction: “precise, perceptive, humane and sensitive”. What will she do next? Does she have a plan? What, for her, could ever top Newlyn? “I always have lots of plans,” she says. “I want to go to Texas for a year, and write about my family on my father’s side: my grandfather was from Dallas, and after the war he set up the Marxist Leninist Society of London. For me, Cornwall is very blue, and I want to look at redness…” She thinks for a moment. “Or perhaps I’ll do a PhD about coastal communities. I need to wait for the pull.” In the meantime, though, of one thing she is certain: that she must go back to using an old-fashioned “brick” phone. “I enjoyed listening to the men at sea. Out there, I realised how our phones are stopping us from listening, and I want to get back really to listening to people.” Her eyes, which today are precisely the same colour as the English channel, meet my own, and hold them for a long minute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa90d971fa9eee2d7ce1e12b8b2faa2ec90720c9/0_308_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=773a482999d46b4490d90061876c4faa","title":"our basic decency is clear but good society needs more than decency","story":"The pandemic has upturned economic certitudes and led to a revival of social solidarity. Now we need politics to match “It may seem a ridiculous idea but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.” So says Dr Rieux, a central character in Albert Camus’s 1947 novel The Plague. The moral thread running through the book, and indeed through much of Camus’s work, is the importance of decency to the choices one makes in life.Camus would probably have welcomed the moral choices made by most of the country in this pandemic. This might seem an odd judgment in light of the outcry about people acting selfishly, from supermarket hoarders to seaside revellers.Yet, given the degree to which our lives have been turned upside down, the extent to which we’ve had to curb our usual behaviours, and the swiftness with which the changes have been imposed, what is extraordinary is not that some people are flouting the new social norms but that the vast majority comply with them so willingly and completely.Even empty supermarket shelves are a signal of how seriously official exhortations about social distancing are being taken. The number of people selfishly hoarding is small. But so many are now at home rather than at work, so many restaurants and cafes closed, so many people shopping less frequently and so buying more each time, that stocks inevitably run low. Ironically, it’s social duty more than selfishness that is emptying the shelves.In part, this reflects the character of a pandemic. The US historian Jill Lepore has written of “plague novels”, such as Camus’s work, that “unlike other species of apocalyptic fiction, where the enemy can be chemicals or volcanoes or earthquakes or alien invaders, the enemy here is other humans”.This is true not just of plague fiction but also of pandemic fact. From the media to the public, we seem to take the actions of a few idiots, rather than the decency of the vast majority, as representative of human nature.In part, too, the tendency to see other people as the problem is nurtured by a more atomised society. And there’s the paradox: the outpouring of community-mindedness – from the half a million people who volunteered to help out the NHS to the mutual aid groups that have sprung up nationwide – takes place against a background of a hollowed-out civic and public life and the fading of many of the organisations through which social solidarity has traditionally been nurtured. It’s perhaps symbolic that social distancing has become the most vital expression of social solidarity.The paradox can be seen too, in the resetting of politics, and in the shifting of the relationship between society and the state. In the space of a few weeks, governments on both sides of the Atlantic have jettisoned policies long considered sacrosanct in good economic management. Commentators who for years have insisted on the need for small government and debt reduction now call for the authorities to “embrace socialism” to save the free market. A Tory minister told the journalist Robert Peston that the government was “implementing most of Jeremy Corbyn’s programme”. And all this after Corbyn was savaged at the polls.The “big state is back”, observed the Economist. But it is different from the big state of the past. The postwar Keynesian compact was shaped, at least in part, by the demands of a vibrant labour movement, and given impetus through a Labour government swept into power by popular acclaim. Today’s big state is being brought into being by politicians who, just an election ago, were making the case for austerity, while we the public remain holed up in our houses watching press conferences in which the new social rules are laid down.Decency is a necessary underpinning of the good society, but not a sufficient one. Beyond decency lies politics. How decency is able to express itself, and what kind of society it can build, depends on political will and collective struggles.What happens to the energy unleashed by the mutual aid societies, the NHS volunteers, the food bank helpers, and to the willingness to upend our lives for the common good? Who will give shape to the new relationship being forged between society and the state? Once we have stopped social distancing, these are the questions we will need to address in the post-pandemic world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c5f0fd58c815fe00c817a47ade7f0dfb55f31f/0_48_3928_2356/master/3928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a567512b0645170227b867232d4204a6","title":"out with pub bores back in with the experts","story":"Boffins are suddenly in fashion again ... ‘waving their statistics and strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!!’“When the government closed the pubs, I said –I didn’t mince my words, I said to them myself,HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME.”MS Toilets, The Wetherspoonland, 1922A public health official friend tells me her colleagues now call the Covid-19 virus “Wetherspoon’s Mumps”, a darkly comic response to Wetherspoon boss Tim Wetherspoon’s initial resistance to closing his pubs for the safety of his customers.It isn’t for civilians to criticise the black humour our brave health professionals deploy to combat the traumatic stress of the war on the coronavirus, especially as I made up the phrase “Wetherspoon’s Mumps” myself out of my own head. Twitter rumours that the virus first jumped species here in the UK after a certain Wetherspoon’s regular had sex with a Wetherspoon’s Steak \u0026amp Kidney Pudding ™ ® in the toilets at the William Withering in Wellington are similarly imaginary.But even as a diehard Remoaner, I have some sympathy for the Wetherspoon’s project. In many areas of the country, Tim Wetherspoon’s cheerful outlets are the only plug for the yawning social chasms left by his friends the Conservatives’ gradual closure of various community hubs over the past decade. And they are warm. And dry.Tim Wetherspoon’s booze palaces are pie-and-a-pint flophouses for the daytime diaspora of the austerity era, where inexpensively nourished customers are hypnotised by bespoke and quite brilliant regionally specific carpet designs and beguiling guest ales, before being seduced by slogan-strewn anti-EU beermats while at their most mentally pliable.One can hardly blame Tim Wetherspoon for making the scientifically unverified claim, on Sky News on Friday 20 March, that there had “been hardly any transmission in pubs”. If, like me, you have contentedly spent entire days in Tim Wetherspoon’s premises, you will know they are magical environments where the laws of science are routinely defied, leaving customers unsure of how they got home, which kind of pie they ate, or even of who they are. And Tim Wetherspoon himself fronted a factually fluid Brexit campaign, endorsed and abetted by our current prime minister, that eschewed evidence and experts as if they were the sort of things only traitors valued.But experts are suddenly back in fashion with a vengeance, emerging blinking from the hidden priest holes of the academic institutions that sheltered them during the public book-burnings of the Brexit campaign, waving their statistics and their strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!!In a strange synchronicity, the people who encouraged distrust in experts are quietly disappeared. Michael Gove is rarely seen, and the results of recent wastewater tests in London, which suggest cocaine use in the capital has fallen by a third, can be attributed solely to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster’s absence from Notting Hill street corners.Jacob Rees-Mogg is also silenced, presumably in case he suggests the victims of Covid-19 had brought their suffering on themselves, by not having the common sense to stay inside their country mansions eating only food foraged from their private estates by their personal servants and their hounds.But Turds is rarely seen these days without being flanked by the mitigatingly solemn countenances of informed experts, his public performance mode of flippant and deliberate dishonesty suddenly forced into an ill-fitting rubber mask of knowledgeable concern, like the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood pretending to be the grandmother by pulling the bedcovers up over his snout and speaking in a high voice.You don’t have to be able to go outside your front door to see that senior Conservatives’ offer of a “Covid coalition” with Labour is a trap for Keir Starmer, the Conservatives’ Labour leader of choice, and the Little Red Riding Hood of this lupine ruse. Starmer could share the blame for the pandemic’s mismanagement, sparing Turds. It’s a trick as transparent as the warm pat on the back David Cameron gave to the slaughtered lamb of Nick Clegg in the Downing Street rose garden 10 years ago, before spinning him round to use as a human shield in the ensuing hail of press-corps machine-gun fire.Is it any wonder that the British public haven’t taken the social distancing advice of this gang of twats seriously when the whole thrust of their campaign this past half decade was that experts are not to be trusted, and that Blitz-spirit Britain could prosper whatever so-called facts were flung at it? But Covid-19 doesn’t just call the Brexit campaign’s bluff. It questions everything about the way we have allowed our society to be run.And as I write this, homeless people housed in Travelodges have just been thrown out into the officially unsafe streets, and we don’t know if kids whose only square meals come from their schools are even eatinge.I don’t consider myself as someone with a significant network of friends, because I spent the past three decades pursuing antisocial evening entertainment work, and because I am arrogant and ill-tempered. But suddenly I find myself in the middle of a massive and mutually supportive email conversation between dozens of like-minded self-employed misfits worldwide, most of whom now have no obvious means of support.The secondhand bookseller touched me the most, who plies his wares from Word on the Water, a barge floating on the canal behind King’s Cross station. He has headed north, unwaged and building a mail-order website, up the River Stort to an uncertain future, like Arrietty making her escape in a floating teapot.

I had the opportunity to meet them and hear them up close, and they’re fantastic live. They’re very credible, accomplished musicians who are making a sound I don’t think anyone else is. Sometimes they’re heavy on the blues guitar and other times it’s just straight-up funk. They can’t be older than in their mid-to-late 20s, but they seem to have been around for ever and have played with everyone including BB King. I’m late to finding out about them but I do like them very much.I am really missing home at the moment. By home, I mean London. At this time of uncertainty, I find myself craving the deeply familiar. I think that’s why my TV habits in the last few weeks have become very UK-centric. Detectorists is so beautifully pitched and so marvellously executed by everyone involved, especially Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones. It could not have been made anywhere else but home. It is hysterically funny and poignant and quietly depicts its male characters particularly in a compassionate and refreshing way. Also, who knew Essex was that bloody lush?Uncut Gems is a story about a New York jeweller, played by Adam Sandler, who gets his hands on a rare stone, which he needs to sell to pay off his gambling debts. It’s a really fantastic exploration of a gambling addict. Even when he wins, he loses. It’s a film that while you’re watching it, you’re not aware of how it is physically affecting you. You have this sense of tension around you. I watched it with my daughters and one of them left the room. Adam Sandler gives the performance of a lifetime – he absolutely carries the movie on his back.My wife keeps trying to get me to visit more exhibitions. There’s an artist called Zak Ové who I’ve known for close to 30 years, but I’ve only just recognised what a great artist he is. He works in found material, mixed media, sculpture and photography. He slightly defies definition. His themes are around the legends of the African diaspora and the Caribbean, particularly the Trinidad carnival. He has a permanent installation of huge, long-limbed figures at the British Museum called Moko Jumbie. My family are from Trinidad, too, so it speaks to me on a number of levels. After 12 years being based in the US, there are certain things from home that have become essential: tea, baked beans, hot pepper sauce, biscuits. Desert Island Discs has joined that list. This may get me into a bit of trouble as a Spurs season ticket holder, but the recent episode with Ian Wright was one of the most triumphant hours of radio I have ever heard. He was so honest and revealing. He spoke so touchingly about his brother and his complex relationship with his mum. He owned the blame for the wrong he had done when success went to his head. I felt by the end of the show I had met the man. I wanted to shake his hand and thank him for how open he had been.Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times by Thomas HauserI am rereading this. It’s research for something I’m thinking of writing. I always return to Muhammad Ali because he’s the only hero I’ve ever really had. The book is almost like a documentary with talking heads. It includes the opinion of people who were close to Ali, sports people, famous people and other fighters who were there during the Rumble in the Jungle, Thrilla in Manila and his stand against Vietnam. The author talks to those connected to him and the civil rights struggle about how this beautiful, brilliant heavyweight boxer influenced their life and the times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe6f33d78dcf4ee17d249a09024ce3d34310769/0_874_3239_1942/master/3239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a3b4c4bb515076d4d16974d772afd50","title":"how to make the most of the spring wildlife carnival on your doorstep","story":"Wherever you live, Britain’s flora and fauna will be at their peak of activity during the nation’s enforced isolation At the risk of sounding smug, I’ve never been so thankful that, a dozen or so years ago, I moved with my young family from London to the heart of Somerset. Like many city-dwellers who have made the change, I do sometimes miss the transport, theatres, cinemas and shops of the capital. Now that these are out of bounds for the foreseeable future, I value even more the things we moved here for: time, space, and nature.During the fine weather of the past week or so, mygarden has been alive with the sounds of spring. From my office window I can hear the metallic wheezing of a greenfinch, the metronomic sound of a chiffchaff calling out its name, trilling wrens, repetitive song thrushes, tuneful robins, and just now, a quartet of ravens high in the sky overhead, uttering their deep, croaking call. And this is not just at dawn and dusk – the traditional peak times for birdsong – but all day long.My large, rural garden is a far cry from the place I grew up – a three-bed semi on a suburban housing estate with a small lawn and flowerbeds – and indeed very different from the various urban properties I lived in for much of my adult life. But nevertheless, when I did live in London, I used to see all sorts of wild creatures in, from and over my various gardens.One advantage of city life is that most creatures are far less fearful of people in the urban jungle than they are in the countryside, meaning you can often get much closer to them. So, wherever you live in the UK – from the centre of the city to the heart of the country – there will always be plenty of wildlife on your doorstep.Given that we are all now living under the equivalent of house arrest, I’m thanking my lucky stars that this crisis has happened just as spring has sprung. Imagine if it had begun in November, when birdsong was non-existent, and the days were shortening. Instead, the timing could not be better, as nature nears its peak of activity. Over the next three months – which, God willing, will be all we have to spend in enforced isolation – Britain’s fauna and flora will be flaunting itself as never before.My teenagers appear to have locked themselves in their bedrooms for the duration, only emerging for meals or to walk the dog. So I have sympathy for those of you with young children, with their constant demands. The good news is that there’s no better way to stave off boredom – and get them outdoors – than engaging their interest in the birds, bees and butterflies making their home in your garden. Keeping a nature diary, making notes and drawings of what you see, is also a great way to motivate them and to maintain your new interest.Before you do, you need to persuade the wildlife to come to your doorstep. If you have never tried to attract birds to your garden, it’s easier than you think. Just as we humans need food, drink and accommodation, so do they. So your mission – should you choose to accept it – is to create the avian equivalent of a five-star hotel and restaurant.There are plenty of reputable mail order companies selling a selection of feeders and food – from a huge tubular apparatus to a small feeder that can be put on the outside of a window – so even if you don’t have a garden, the birds will still come. But don’t cut corners on quality: during the breeding season, when birds need to find natural food such as caterpillars for their chicks, they rely on high-energy foods like kibbled sunflower hearts.Water is equally important, especially during warm, dry weather. A bird bath serves a dual purpose: the birds can both drink and bathe, sprucing up their plumage so they can fly and feed more efficiently.If you haven’t already done so, it’s perhaps a bit late to put up nestboxes, as resident birds such as blue and great tits will already have started prospecting for sites. But if you can get hold of one – or make it yourself – during the next few days it might still be worth doing so. Ideally, put it two or three metres up a tree or fence post, facing north or east (not south or west as the chicks may overheat in the sun).Alternatively, if you have shrubs and bushes in your garden, robins, dunnocks, wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes may already be nesting there. One way to tell if they are is to watch them closely: if you see a bird carrying items of food in its beak, it is almost certainly taking them back to its chicks.Don’t forget to look above you. In towns and cities, house martins and then swifts will soon be with us, the latter tearing across the sky in tight-knit squadrons while uttering their screaming sounds. Here in Somerset, along with many people across the northern hemisphere, I’m eagerly awaiting the first swallow returning from its African winter quarters.Many birds are visible all year round, but now that spring is here, insects are also beginning to emerge. Bumblebees are tough enough to have been on the wing since February: check out the colour and pattern on their abdomen (the rear end) to see which species are visiting your garden.Butterflies are also out on warm, sunny days: many species love gardens as there are plenty of nectar-rich flowers for them to feed. So far only a few species have appeared, but over the next few weeks I’m looking forward to catching up with orange-tip, speckled wood, common and holly blues, and red admirals – which fly here all the way from southern Europe and North Africa. The key to attracting these and other insects is to plant flowers: native varieties are best, but any nectar-bearing blooms will work.Mammals are a lot trickier to see: even the really common species are often shy and mainly nocturnal. You may already be aware of foxes in your neighbourhood – and perhaps even badgers if there is a sett nearby. It’s OK to feed them as long as you don’t put the food too close to the house, and also avoid giving them items out of your hand.To see smaller mammals such as wood mice, voles and shrews, you’ll need to invest in a trail camera, so you can record what goes on in your garden while you are asleep, and then upload and watch the footage the next day. You will probably get lots of cats too.Another largely nocturnal group of visitors to your garden are moths. Forget your hostility towards the handful of species whose caterpillars munch through your best woollens: moths are one of the most erse, beautiful and fascinating creatures on the planet – yet most of us never even see them. To do so, simply wait until dusk, ideally on a warm, muggy and moonless night, and then shine a bright torch on to a white sheet. You’ll be amazed at what you find: including impossibly huge and exotic hawkmoths, which are found throughout Britain, including in our towns and cities. Younger children are especially enchanted by these fascinating and mysterious creatures.These wild visitors are much more interesting if you know what you are looking at so it’s well worth investing in a decent pair of binoculars (for birds and mammals), and in two or three field guides for the key groups you want to identify. Make sure you choose those that only cover British wildlife (not Britain and Europe), otherwise you’ll find that there are lots of species found only on the continent which we never see here at home.For birds, I’d recommend the RSPB’s Pocket Guide, while for insects those from British Wildlife Publishing are superb. And there are sound guides available too, to help you identify birdsong. The downside is that, because of the increased demand for books and other products, it may take a few days or even weeks to get hold of some titles.But why should you bother engaging with the natural world at all? Partly, for your own sanity: it is now proven that being in touch with nature – especially birdsong – is good for your health and wellbeing. Reducing stress and putting the world into perspective is exactly what we all need right now.Nature needs us, too: we don’t need reminding that we are living at a time of an even greater emergency – the climate crisis. The more we know about the natural world, the more we can help it – as Sir David Attenborough wisely noted, “No one will protect what they don’t care about and no one will care about what they have never experienced.”Finally, appreciating the part nature plays in our lives is also, I would argue, an essential part of what makes us human. If any good can emerge from the current situation, then surely one outcome might be a greater appreciation of what nature means to us, and what, in turn, we can do for nature. And whatever the future holds, I promise that you will never ever regret engaging with the wildlife on your doorstep.• Stephen Moss is an author and naturalist based in Somerset, who teaches an MA in Travel and Nature Writing at Bath Spa University. His latest book is The Accidental Countryside: Hidden Havens for Britain’s Wildlife ( Faber)With its smart black, white yellow and green plumage and perky habits, the largest member of the tit family is found in most urban and rural gardens. Listen out for its syncopated song: “tea-cher, tea-cher”, with the stress on the second syllable – hence my children’s name for it, the “teacher bird”.Britain’s commonest bird is normally elusive, but much easier to see at this time of year, when the males make up to half-a-dozen nests before the female chooses her favourite. Look out for a tiny brown bird with whirring wings and, when it lands, a cocked tail and listen for its loud, trilling song.Four species that overwinter as adults have already emerged: the peacock, small tortoiseshell, comma and bright yellow brimstone. And look out for the delightful orange-tip – like a cabbage white with Jaffa-coloured wingtips.If you are lucky enough to have a garden pond, or just some water nearby, this is the peak time for our amphibian species to be laying their spawn – with tadpoles soon to follow.Britain’s favourite bird is at its most belligerent, with the males chasing off any rivals that dare to invade their garden territory. Males are also the ones that sing that delicate, tuneful song the females, which look identical, are busy building a nest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc63932315d2ab8fbcb83575c103add1e5d1f9ba/149_0_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90759b5ba4c348c46bf3fa93ed1f2343","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including a puma on the streets of Santiago, Chile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e952d1ee0126035261201cea621b4e64fee3f5/172_480_5944_3567/master/5944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72d1bbefcb14d17fee8a9aae983891c0","title":"english muslim pakistani how i tell my kids about their identities","story":"As she raises three boys, our writer is starting to face tough questions from them about where they fit in. Her answer? As a whole, not just halves…My six-year-old son is learning about fractions. He sits next to me at the dining table, and draws a bat, then colours half of it green. “The word half is used when something is split into two equal parts,” he explains. I nod, go back to my laptop.Then he looks up at me and says, “I’ve got two halves. I’m half-Muslim, half-English. Right?” He looks at me expectantly, waiting for me to confirm whether his calculation is correct and my heart sort of breaks a little, to hear him refer to himself as pieces of a whole.“Not quite,” I say. “Some of your family is Pakistani, because I am, and some of your family is English, because Dada is. And you are fully Muslim.”“No, Dada is not Muslim. Only you are. So only half of me is.”I am startled by his interpretation. My husband converted to Islam before marrying me. I say, “What do you mean? Of course he’s Muslim!”“So if they’re not, why is he?”I was warned that this sort of confusion might happen in a mixed marriage. When I told my moderately religious family that I had met someone who was neither Pakistani nor (at least not then) Muslim, and that we wanted to get married once he had converted, they understandably had a lot of questions. One of those questions was: how would we raise our kids to know that they were Muslim, to know their Pakistani side and where they came from? Race and religion are often rightly seen as two separate things but they are also closely entwined. I was reminded I’d need to make a concerted effort to teach my future children about their Pakistani origins and their religion, because their sense of identity would not be a given. Because otherwise my half-Pakistani, Muslim kids might risk being lost.I send a WhatsApp message to a friend of mine who, like me, has three boys and also happens to be Muslim and Pakistani. I tell her how I think I’m probably messing my kids up. “I’m not sure I’m doing this right,” I text. “Hey,” she says. “We all feel like that. You’re doing great.”I don’t know if I am though. Sometimes I worry someone will say they told me so. I hastily download an Islamic app for children, full of animations of cute characters with big brown eyes. It feels important to prove I am making an effort. It holds the boys’ interest for 10 minutes. I remember how, when I was growing up, I wasn’t always sure if I was praying because I wanted to or had been reminded to. I know that there are certain habits I will need to teach them, like how to pray in Arabic. I worry that if I push too much, perhaps they’ll grow up resenting both their religion and me. Then I wonder sadly if maybe that’s normal anyway, part of their teenage years to come.Sometimes when I look at my children, I hear that same question repeating itselfin my head: how will I raise you to know that you are Muslim, to know your Pakistani side? I think about what I love most from my Pakistani upbringing: the sense of warmth and liveliness translated into kitchen tables spilling with an overabundance of food, surrounded by far too many people talking too loudly and at the same time, and I realise this is what our own home is like anyway. I think of the values of faith I hold most dear honesty, love, kindness, generosity. I realise our children are lucky enough to be surrounded by all this too. I would want to pass these values on, regardless. None of this is exclusive to one sort of identity over another. So this, I conclude, is how they will learn who they are: from seeing it, living it, breathing it, rather than telling them who they are supposed to be.Over the last six years, I have learnt that motherhood comes with many expectations. Some of those expectations I have put upon myself, unnecessarily. So now I watch my children being themselves, and I allow myself to consider the possibility that maybe I am doing great after all.• Huma Qureshi has contributed to The Best, Most Awful Job: Twenty Writers Talk Honestly About Motherhood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b2b262ce32f1dddc51fe9c6f27131996d79f6d/0_3674_5650_3388/master/5650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eada7ea50b6c18acae5f009ea623ed3f","title":"nigel slater recipe roast duck leg cannellini beans pickled radish gherkin","story":"Sweet and sharp, crisp and soft – a duck supper that takes flightSometimes, dinner comes together so perfectly you can’t imagine why you haven’t done it before. It did so this week, when crisp-skinned duck legs shared a plate with plump ivory beans and pink, pickled onions as sharp as a surgeon’s knife. Crisp yet soft, sweet yet teasingly sharp, this was a meal, both frugal and luxurious, where everything seemed in perfect harmony.The cannellini beans, cooked from dried, plumped up to the size of sugared almonds in a simple stock with shallot, celery and bay leaves. Drained, we then baked them in the same roasting tin as the duck and its fat, the dish moistened with a ladle of the beans’ milky, aromatic cooking liquor. The beans, their insides swollen with stock and fat, crisped a little in the roasting tin.Nudging against the duck was the fresh, acid-sweet pickle of carrots, red onion and watermelon radish (I could have used mooli or even French breakfast radish). We mopped up the juice from our plates – a tantalising puddle of warm duck fat, cider vinegar, rosemary and salt – with winter leaves of deep red and mottled pink, that we had crisped in iced water before dressing them with a mustard vinaigrette.We finished with a plate of fat-bottomed Comice pears that I had been ripening for a week on the ledge by the window in the kitchen, turning them daily until they were ripe and giving. I put them on the table, thoroughly chilled, with a thick plank of taleggio, its flesh mild and sweet and smelling curiously of autumn leaves.I use legs because their skin crisps more satisfyingly than that of the breasts and their flesh is infinitely more succulent and, curiously, cheaper. If they come wrapped in plastic, as is often the case, remove it, dry the skin with kitchen paper and let them come to room temperature before cooking. They will be all the crisper for it. Serves 4For the beans:dried cannellini beans 500gcelery 1 stickthyme 6 sprigsblack peppercorns 8bay leaves 4shallot 1, largeFor the duck:garlic 7 clovesblack peppercorns 10olive oil 8 tbspduck legs 4rosemary 10 sprigsSoak the dried beans in a bowl of deep, cold water overnight. The following day, drain the beans, put them into a large, deep saucepan and cover them with water. Add the celery stick, broken in half, the thyme, peppercorns, bay and the shallot, halved. Bring to the boil, lower the heat and partially cover with a lid. Leave the beans to simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until they are tender enough to crush between finger and thumb.For the duck, first season the olive oil with salt and pepper. Peel the garlic and put 3 of the cloves in a mortar or wooden bowl with a good pinch of sea salt and the peppercorns. Smash the garlic, salt and peppercorns to a paste with a pestle or the end of a rolling pin, then stir in the olive oil. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Rub the duck legs all over with the seasoned oil and set aside in a cool place for half an hour. Drain the beans, reserving a good ladleful of the cooking liquor. Brown the duck legs in a roasting tin over a moderate heat, turning them now and again, until each side is golden brown. Turn the legs plump side up.Spoon the drained beans around the duck legs, tuck in the rosemary sprigs and the reserved garlic cloves then pour in the reserved ladle of bean cooking liquor.Bake the duck for about 45-50 minutes, turning the beans over once during cooking. Serve the duck and beans with the pickle below.I have been making these vivid pink pickles once a week, eating them with chalky white goat’s cheese, tossing them into leafy salads and serving them alongside grilled pork chops. The pickling liquor makes a cracking base for a dressing, too, with a little groundnut oil and a dash of sesame. I splash the pink juice over steamed rice, too. The pickles will keep, crisp and bright, in a covered bowl or lidded glass jar for several days. Serves 4Cut the cornichons in half lengthways, reserving 150ml of the pickling liquor from the jar. Peel the carrot, slice it very thinly, then add it to the cornichons. Peel the red onions, then slice into very thin rounds. Separate the rings and add to the carrot.Peel and very finely slice the radish, then cut each slice into quarters. Add to the carrots and onions and set aside.Put the reserved pickling liquor, cider and wine vinegars, black and white peppercorns, the salt and sugar into a small stainless-steel saucepan and bring to the boil. Pour over the sliced vegetables and cover with a plate. Refrigerate for 4 hours, preferably overnight.

Yet by the same token, there is something inherently glorious about a goalkeeper who refuses to be constrained by the “rules” of “society”, which is why Stuart Pearce’s brainwave to have Manchester City’s David James galumphing about in Middlesbrough’s area on the final day of the 2004-05 season is a Hall of Fame moment. Weirdly unsettling but also totally adorable, like watching a cat trying to turn a door handle. Ha! Look at the keeper go! He thinks he’s people! He thinks he has opposable thumbs!But these are life’s dreamers. Like David Brent refusing to give up on the idea that he was wasted as the manager of a small paper company in Slough, there are goalkeepers who are convinced they are wasted simply operating between the sticks. Fabien Barthez, for instance, was a chilled-out entertainer with delusions of grandeur and it could be argued that no one knows the smell of the onion bag better than a goalkeeper. To catch a thief, you must think like a thief, so to score a goal, you must first let in a goal. Admittedly that’s a stupid argument, but when has that ever stopped the Joy of Six in the past?Yet while most goalkeepers are kidding themselves, some of these frustrated strikers actually do have something to offer going forward. Of course, leave it to a Brazilian to set the benchmark for his peers. If an English goalkeeper ever scored 112 goals in his career, the likelihood is it would be down to the wind catching 112 agricultural hoofs forward and sending them swirling over his opposite number, but that’s not Rogério Ceni’s style. Ceni, who plays for São Paulo, is that rarest and most cherished of species, a goalkeeper who also happens to be a free-kick and penalty specialist, and stands on top of the goalscoring charts, miles ahead of the rest of the field.His record is not perfect and he has missed penalties, most notably in the last minute of a match against Corinthians last year, but he has also scored a Panenka against the same opponents. It is not clear whether Ceni had his membership of the Goalkeepers’ Union revoked after that.Having honed his technique, Ceni is as big a threat with a dead ball as any outfield player – Zico once said, perhaps not entirely seriously, that he was better than him at free-kicks – and the joyous scenes when he scored his 100th career goal with a glorious effort from 25 yards were a sight to behold. Now 41, Ceni plans to bring a remarkable career to a close at the end of the season. No doubt he has something big planned for his final game.Of course, Ceni is not the only goalscoring goalkeeper. He’s just the best goalscoring goalkeeper. But there are others, such as Mexico’s fashion-conscious Jorge Campos, who scored 38 goals, and René Higuita, who scored 41 goals. Until Ceni, though, Paraguay’s legendary goalkeeper, José Luis Chilavert, was the daddy of the lot. He first came to attention in England during the 1998 World Cup, when he became the first goalkeeper ever to shoot direct at goal from a free-kick in the tournament, narrowly missing against Bulgaria. He could be a fiery character and was involved in rows with Roberto Carlos, claiming he only spat at the Brazil left-back to defend himself after being insulted, and Faustino Asprilla, but he also had a humble streak, often shaking hands with the goalkeepers he had scored against.And he was brilliant. A fine shot-stopper, he won personal awards for his goalkeeping and played for Paraguay 74 times and at two World Cups. He scored eight goals for his country, which is more than any other international goalkeeper, and his free-kicks were outstanding. That left foot knew how to manipulate a football.Some people, those who have put the bald statistics to one side, say that Chilavert was better than Ceni. They have a point when you consider that Chilavert scored intentionally with a free-kick from the halfway line for Vélez against River Plate in 1996, a goal so good that the cameraman almost missed it and the River goalkeeper was so dumbfounded he simply fell over backwards as the ball flies in. Chilavert celebrated appropriately, both arms outstretched, a look of glee on his face, an amusingly slow jog to nowhere in particularly and, finally, a botched Klinsmann e that ends up as a belly flop.It was not until 1912 that the law was modified to say that goalkeepers could only handle the ball inside their area. Previously they had been allowed to pick it up anywhere inside their own half – honestly, one rule for them, another for the rest of us – which is why it was possible for two goalkeepers to score in a match between Third Lanark and Motherwell in 1910.The first recorded instance of a goalkeeper scoring in England came on 14 April 1900, when Manchester City’s Charlie Williams scored in a 3-1 defeat by Sunderland. Although there appears to be no coverage available of the match from the time, the following report in the Times on 17 October 1958 did refer to it:It is said that Williams’s kick bounced three times before going in and that Doig, who always wore a cap to hide his baldness, later said that the only reason it caught him out is because he was examining a damaged finger. A likely story.“And … wait … yes … yes ... it appears the goalkeeper is going forward ... they’re beckoning him forward … or are they telling him to stay back … no, they’re telling him to go forward for the corner! They’re sending the goalkeeper forward!“The above, without fail, is the words that fall out of every commentator’s mouth when a goalkeeper ventures forward at a corner to try to salvage an equaliser for his side. Usually such a fevered buildup leads to nothing, the delivery going nowhere near the goalkeeper, whose presence alone is supposed to unsettle the defending team, who we are supposed to assume will be completely unprepared for such an eventuality. The goalkeeper is not necessarily there to score – sometimes he just meant to cause havoc and spread panic. Two goalkeepers in the same area! Which one is which! Which one is ours! What’s that round thing coming towards me! Why is everyone shouting! Run! Run for your lives!But it can work and it is exciting when it does. Peter Schmeichel, who scored 13 goals in his career, first found the net for Manchester United with a last-minute header in their Uefa Cup exit to Rotor Volgograd in 1995. “Schmeichel came out of his goal and the final minutes were played out with him using his huge bulk in the Russian area,” wrote Guy Hodgson in the Independent and the Dane also scored a volley for Aston Villa at Everton in 2001.His finest goal was one that didn’t count, though, an overhead kick that looked to have taken United’s FA Cup fourth-round replay against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park into extra time, only for the flag to go up for offside.By now, you are probably wondering when this is going to end. And also where the Jimmy Glass entry is. Well, there is no Jimmy Glass entry, because the loanee who scored the injury-time goal that kept Carlisle in the Football League in 1999 has had his own Joy of Six spot two years ago. “There’s nothing new to say about Jimmy Glass,” Rob Smyth wrote. “Glass’s goal is one of the great moments in British football, and his name is almost as evocative as that of Ronnie Radford.”So this will have to do but what Glass’s earth-shattering escape act tells us is that it is difficult to beat the drama of a goalkeeper scoring a goal in the last minute, not least because it tends to be the defining moment of a match. Or sometimes a career.Not always, though. At first glance, there is nothing particularly memorable about Brad Friedel’s last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers in a nondescript Premier League match against Charlton Athletic in 2004. Admittedly Blackburn, who were struggling near the bottom of the table, had roared back from 2-0 down to level the match at 2-2 at The Valley, so it looked like Friedel had secured a vital point for his team by redirecting a wayward shot past Dean Kiely from close range. And that should have been that. Charlton, the inept fools, had thrown the game away and Brad of the Rovers was the hero. All that was left now was to see whether Blackburn could score again in the time left.But wait! Barely a minute later, the ball was hoofed forwards by Charlton after the restart and when it dropped to Claus Jensen on the edge of the area, he looped a volley towards the top-right corner and Friedel, presumably still giddy and not entirely focused after his goal, got a hand to the shot but not enough to keep it out. Oh Brad! “I find it hard to speak,” Blackburn’s manager, Graeme Souness, said, an affliction that he fortunately rid himself of before becoming a pundit.Anyone who has ever played football in the park or on the playground has experienced that creeping sense of dread when your goalkeeper, the ball in his hands, gets that glint in his eye. You know the one: it’s supposed to warn you that he has short-circuited and that you have to stop him before he sets off on a jaunty, doomed dribble that is supposed to be a tribute to Diego Maradona but will end with him losing the ball and the other side’s striker booting it into the empty net while you curse yourself for not acting sooner.All of which is why no good can come from Laurent Monde’s absurd goal for Kouroucien in French Guyana. It will only encourage disastrous imitations and no one can possibly emulate Monde’s moment of genius. Unfortunately the grainy video only starts with him picking up possession on the right in his half so we do not know how the move began, but what happens next is truly ridiculous, Monde hurtling through the challenges and up the wing like a contestant on Gladiators blindly charging through The Gauntlet head-first and somehow managing to keep the ball despite always appearing to be on the verge of falling over, as if he is stumbling through a series of invisible hurdles. Presumably everyone was too scared to tackle him, mindful of the fact that you got an automatic red card if you even breathed near the opposition keeper on Fifa 98: Road to the World Cup.Eventually Monde blooters a thunderous shot home from way out on the right, before being mobbed by his team-mates, who probably spent the entire sequence calling him every name under the sun until he scored. Confusion arises as the only name that it is possible to make out on the commentary is Stanley Menzo, a Dutch goalkeeper who starred for Ajax between 1983 and 1994. The likeliest explanation for this is that Menzo was regarded as a goalkeeper before his time because he was so comfortable with the ball at his feet.As for the rest of you, though, don’t go getting any ideas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9788364422aeb2f0ac8fe9c3b6e1e7392e340b2/0_0_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352b123b673ee2924f15fb66e48cc62a","title":"premier league clubs change last summer","story":"Tottenham and Manchester City are among the clubs who would probably make very different decisions if they could reset the Premier League as if it were Football ManagerThe season must be completed. The season must be abandoned now. As the arguments gabble on, only occasionally acknowledging their own hypothetical nature given how little we know about how the virus will proceed, how long the lockdown may last and whether there may be a second wave of infections when it is lifted, it’s tempting t o dip into another hypothetical. What if this were like a game of Football Manager? What if we could quit without saving and go back and start again last summer? What would Premier League clubs, given their time over, do differently?Let’s start with the obvious one: Tottenham’s decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino and replace him with José Mourinho. Once a path has been embarked on, there is perhaps some logic in pursuing it to its conclusion, but would Daniel Levy really take that road again? Tottenham are without a win in their past six games. They’ve gone out of the FA Cup and Champions League. They’re seven points adrift of fourth. They’ve kept three clean sheets in 26 games under Mourinho. For Spurs, this season has been a shambles.Injuries haven’t helped, while Mourinho loyalists point to a creaking and jaded squad. But if the squad is an excuse for Mourinho, why was it not for Pochettino? It’s not as though he wasn’t aware of its failings, not as though he hadn’t been campaigning for two years for greater transfer spending.Levy, given the choice between replacing the manager or the bulk of the squad, went for the manager, but it looks as if he will end up having to replace the bulk of the squad as well. And when it comes down to it, which would you rather have: a thrusting manager with a point to prove and a recent history of team-building on a budget or a weary former great who has come increasingly to deal in big transfers and whose ideas have begun to look outmoded?In terms of other managerial comings and goings, Watford may think they could have sacked Javi Gracia in the summer rather than waiting until September and they certainly wouldn’t bother again with the 12 games under Quique Sánchez Flores. Everton, Arsenal and West Ham, perhaps, will think that they could have acted more swiftly to arrest seasons that were drifting.In terms of the top of the table, Liverpool would presumably change very little, although they might perhaps look at what happened around the winter break and wonder if something in their schedule led to the slight loss of rhythm in February and early March. Given how the Atlético game turned out, they might also look at upgrading their reserve goalkeeper.For Manchester City, though, there is one clear problem that they would surely take steps to address: the lack of cover at centre-back. The departure of Vincent Kompany inevitably risked leaving a vacuum of leadership, but there was no need for there also to be a vacuum of defensive nous. With Nicolás Otamendi always a slightly rash and clumsy figure, the least obviously Guardiolista player in the squad, and John Stones’s form uncertain, City were left extremely dependent on Aymeric Laporte. That he has started seven league games this season is the major reason the gap to Liverpool is so vast, not only because of his absence but because Fernandinho has been lost to the midfield as he has been forced to drop back as an emergency central defender.Manchester United’s case is intriguing. Given their improvement after the arrival of Bruno Fernandes – they have won six and drawn three games since signing him at the end of January – they would presumably try to land him in the summer. Harry Maguire, assuming United still deemed him worth the £80m fee, would probably have been signed earlier in the summer to give him more time to adjust to his new teammates the attempt to drive down the fee by drawing out negotiations simply did not work.Given that Paul Pogba has started five league games this season and none since September, offloading him last summer presumably would be a priority surely nobody now, even at United, thinks a positive future still awaits him at the club? And there are those, too, who would argue that Ole Gunnar Solskjær should have been replaced when Pochettino became available, although recent form has perhaps begun to soften the concerns about the Norwegian’s long-term suitability for the job.What about signings that clubs would now avoid? Would City spend £58.5m on João Cancelo, who has started eight league games? Newcastle, surely, would not spend £40m on Joelinton, a forward wholly unsuited to the isolated frontman role he has been asked to fulfil. Spurs might still splash out £54m on Tanguy Ndombele, but not if they still planned to bring in Mourinho. Aston Villa, perhaps, would rethink their entire transfer strategy: they spent £140m to no great effect. While the injury to Wesley was unfortunate, only Tyrone Mings has been a clear success. West Ham would probably reconsider their transfer policy, but it’s hard to think of the last season when that wouldn’t have been the case.Leicester and Chelsea presumably wouldn’t change too much, although Frank Lampard might start using Olivier Giroud earlier given the opportunity. But perhaps the most interesting case of a club with little to fix is Norwich. It is easy to say that they should have spent more, that a splurge on a couple of high-class players might make the difference for them.But given the financial constraints under which they operate, it’s not clear how much more they could have done. Daniel Farke is a consistently engaging coach whose young team play attractive, bright football. It wouldn’t have taken much to have gone differently for them not to be adrift at the bottom.That, perhaps, is the key: the league table doesn’t lie, but it cannot be considered without context. And that’s where asking, given context, what might reasonably have been improved feels useful. No audit can look only at results."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d56ee25cdcbc90174148cd7b3721c3099060e1a7/0_161_4105_2463/master/4105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf74085cab34c6f39c4bb31cb4d8154","title":"ugandas crackdown on public gatherings ruled unconstitutional","story":"Swipe at lawmakers as judge says only ‘undemocratic and authoritarian regimes’ seek to ban peaceful protests Government opponents and human rights activists have welcomed a decision by Uganda’s constitutional court to overturn legislation that gave police “supernatural powers” to stop public gatherings and protests.“It is only in undemocratic and authoritarian regimes that peaceful protests and public gatherings of a political nature are not tolerated,” said Justice Cheborion Barishaki in a ruling on Thursday.“I wholly reject the notion that the police have supernatural powers to determine that particular public gathering shouldn’t be allowed to happen because it will result in a breach of peace,” he said.The court’s judges declared section 8 of Uganda’s Public Order Management Act illegal and unconstitutional.The challenge to the law was brought by three human rights groups, opposition legislators and a retired bishop in December 2013. Similar provisions to those in the act were contained in a previous law that was declared unconstitutional in 2005.The police used the law to brutally disperse rallies organised by opposition politician Kizza Besigye in the lead-up to the 2016 elections, and more recently to block meetings and concerts by pop star turned politician Bobi Wine.In a tweet, Besigye said: “Congratulations @nickopiyo \u0026amp the petitioners for this important court decision nullifying Uganda’s obnoxious POMA Law! Without rule of law however, Uganda police will continue to act with impunity (as it did before this law was made) but without a false cover. Shame on Uganda parliament.”Dr Livingstone Sewanyana, executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, welcomed the ruling, saying it had been “an obstacle to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression, association and assembly in Uganda”.“Granting unfettered powers to police to deny, disperse and block meetings had a chilling effect on the democratic rights of Ugandans, particularly the political opposition, human rights defenders and activists,” he said.Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s director for east and southern Africa, said the law had been used as a tool of repression.“Under this law police have brutally dispersed spontaneous demonstrations and opposition rallies, while opposition politicians have been beaten up and arrested simply for exercising their rights,” she said, adding that Ugandan lawmakers must now repeal the entire act, which contradicted the constitution, ahead of next year’s presidential elections.In January, police arrested Wine and fired teargas at his supporters when he tried to hold a rally to mark his 2021 presidential bid.Since he became a legislator in 2017, Wine has rattled Ugandan authorities, who see him as a threat to President Yoweri Museveni. Museveni has been in power since 1986.Joel Ssenyonyi, spokesperson for Wine’s People Power Movement, said he was concerned that the ruling would be ignored. “This government is notorious for disregarding court orders,” he said.Sarah Kasande, of the International Centre for Transitional Justice, said the move “will open up space for political activists and human rights defenders to exercise their rights to peacefully assemble, and to debate public policies and advocate for change”. Ssenyonyi added: “If people are allowed to speak up, assemble and demonstrate freely, a new political dispensation will be born, giving rise to transformative leadership in the country that is needed more than ever before to counter the new threats once Covid-19 is contained.” Uganda has 18 confirmed cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93cadecba66833b8ad5fa69f91e3d44ce252681d/0_91_7762_4658/master/7762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fcad43f1d0a00d0a9784b726c0e208d","title":"im working at home can i make a comfortable chair myself","story":"My back is killing me and I need some DIY tips to find seating that worksEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I’ve been working at home for a week now but my back is killing me.

It is like the X Factor. Imagine what would happen if any one of these recordings got into the public domain, with us laying out our plans for the future and saying how wonderful it felt to have won. The unrealistic nature of it all just about sums up the last five years.”Another candidate said: “It is impossible to see how anyone can record something in advance like this with any conviction. It is not going to happen.”It is now expected that some other method will be found so that brief acceptance speeches can be made on the day of the announcement by the two winners.Under the current plans the candidates to succeed outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn and his former deputy Tom Watson will be informed of the result a few minutes before it is made public.The deputy leadership is being contested by Angela Rayner, Rosena Allin-Khan, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Dawn Butler.The original plan had to been to gather at least 1,000 party members and senior figures at a special conference in London to announce the new leader.Starmer is the bookies’ favourite to win the contest for leader while Angela Rayner is regarded by many as frontrunner for the deputy post. On Friday Rayner announced she was “self-isolating” after suffering symptoms of coronavirus.She said on Twitter: “I am now in self isolation as I have the symptoms of #Coronavirus they started last night and have gradually got worse. I will be a bit quieter than usual but will still be keeping in touch with people as best as l can.”In an interview with the BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Corbyn said the country had been “ill-prepared” for the coronavirus pandemic because of “10 years of austerity, of underfunding the National Health Service and underfunding our benefit system”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/284fae38f0c9974eefd4e1d3aa4609428a92f957/0_138_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25ecb30ec8d8f2a034d61f834ed04df3","title":"alex salmonds accusers urge other women to be brave","story":"Group issues powerful rebuke to those who allege that they conspired togetherNine women who made complaints of sexual offences against Alex Salmond have urged other women to “be brave, be loud, be heard” in the face of bullying, sexual harassment and assault, in a powerful rebuke to those who have accused them of conspiring against the former Scottish National party leader.Last week a jury at the high court in Edinburgh found the former first minister not guilty of 12 sexual assaults, including one attempted rape. It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was “not proven”, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict, but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law.All verdicts were by majority, following an 11-day trial. Salmond was formally acquitted of one sexual assault charge midway through the court case after it was withdrawn by the prosecution.The nine different women, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and who included Scottish government officials and SNP employees, described in court alleged assaults, many of which they claimed took place late at night in the private rooms of the first minister’s official residence, Bute House.Salmond denied all their allegations, describing them variously as “reinterpretations”, “exaggerations”, and “deliberate fabrications for political purposes”.In a highly unusual move, reflecting the frustration the complainants feel at being characterised as co-conspirators, the women have set out their response to the verdicts, which they describe as “devastating”.In a joint statement signed jointly by all nine women who testified against Salmond, they write: “We remain firm in our belief that coming forward to report our experiences and concerns was the right thing to do.”The women insist that they are still not in direct contact with each other, and that they do not know the identities of all their fellow complainers. The statement was released by Rape Crisis Scotland.Describing the trial as “a traumatic process”, the statement continues: “As politicians, commentators and society reflect on this case, we would ask you to consider whether behaviour which is so often merely described as ‘inappropriate’ or is tolerated by society, is acceptable towards your daughters, granddaughters, sisters, wives, friends, and colleagues.”During and since the trial, the women have faced an onslaught of abuse online and have been issued with personal alarms by the police. They add: “We would also request that as you debate, you conduct it respectfully and stay mindful of the many women in Scotland who may have had traumatic experiences and are considering whether or not Scotland is a country in which they can come forward to seek help and support.”Immediately after the verdict, Salmond’s allies called for prominent officials in Nicola Sturgeon’s office and the Scottish National party to be fired after text messages and emails came to light that Salmond argues raises serious questions about their role in the case, and their handling of allegations against him, including the botched Scottish government internal inquiry into complaints of sexual misconduct brought against him by two civil servants in 2018. Salmond is now expected to sue the Scottish government and wants to put his case to the Holyrood inquiry into the handling of the initial allegations.Salmond’s defence was that the allegations had been orchestrated by one of the complainers, witness A, a senior official in the Scottish government, while others had been exaggerated. Giving evidence, Salmond admitted with hindsight he wished he had been “more careful with people’s personal space”, while his defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC described his behaviour as “inappropriate” and “touchy-feely” during cross-examination. Since the verdict, Salmond’s own former speechwriter described his defence as “I’m sleazy but not criminal”.The women write: “In defending Alex Salmond, Gordon Jackson quoted Woman H and said his client should have been a ‘better man’. He said behaviour which others described as demeaning, intimidating and humiliating, was ‘trivial’. The behaviours that Alex Salmond and his defence team admitted to in evidence were not and are not trivial”. Today we want to send a strong and indisputable message that such behaviours should not be tolerated – by any person, in any position, under any circumstances.”Thanking Police Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service “for taking our experiences seriously and for allowing our voices to be heard”, they assert: “Many of us did speak up at the time of our incidents but were faced with procedures that could not deal with complaints against such a powerful figure. Others were silenced by fear of repercussions.”The trial raised serious questions about the way the civil service and the SNP dealt with complaints. In their evidence, some of the women said they feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or that the matter would be “swept under the carpet”.The court also heard from a number of witnesses who said that Salmond’s behaviour led to an unofficial ban on him working alone with female civil servants at Bute House late at night. After a junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 – a charge Salmond denied, stating instead that the pair had “a sleepy cuddle” – the jury heard that instead of an investigation, civil service officials and Salmond’s most senior aide brokered a private apology from the first minister.The women’s statement argues that “for too long, women have been let down by organisational structures which should exist to protect them”.“We should all seek to create an environment in which people can challenge and report behaviours without hesitation or fear of retribution.” Their statement concludes: “While we are devastated by the verdict, we will not let it define us. We hope through shining a light on our experiences, it will serve to protect and empower women in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ebb2acfcc8c8ada9ba4e1b6e9b1e710511d451/15_199_3923_2355/master/3923.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c75fcd1dcfd6d027d483f3464fdd6f7d","title":"hollie pearne webb great britain hockey captain olympic games","story":"Great Britain’s hockey captain, who played a key part in the Rio gold, believes the postponement of the Olympics will give extra time to develop her young squadWhen Hollie Pearne-Webb was growing up, she had an indoor pastime that drove her mum potty. She had fallen hard for hockey from her very first session, as an eight-year-old, at the club near her Derbyshire home. Now she hated to be without a stick in her hand. “I was always knocking around a ball inside the house, hitting things,” says Pearne-Webb with a laugh.The schoolgirl Hollie never imagined herself playing for the British women’s hockey team, much less scoring the winning penalty in an Olympic final. But she would, at least, recognise the game Pearne-Webb has been playing on her living room carpet recently. Team GB have been training in isolation for the past fortnight – and not all of them have gardens.Great Britain’s captain has, so far, avoided breaking any furnishings. Most of her training is being done in her garage, converted into a makeshift gym, complete with stationary bike, bar weights and kettlebells borrowed from the neighbours. She had just finished a conditioning session when the news broke that this year’s Olympic Games were to be postponed. She was expecting it – everyone in her team was. That didn’t make the disappointment any less acute. “Every part of our life is geared towards going to the Olympic Games,” says Pearne-Webb, “so having that moved changes so much.”For athletes who have been mentally and physically readying themselves for peak performance in August, a 12-month delay can be a career-ender. “There are probably a few girls in the team wondering: ‘Can I do this for another year?’”Andthen there’s the prospect of no hockey for months. The longest an international player usually goes between games is two or three weeks: the current hiatus is likely to be “much, much longer”. Happily, the team remains fully funded until next March, but Pearne-Webb still has to find a way to captain a 25-strong squad who can’t be near each other. Even her long-time mentor, Kate Richardson-Walsh, who led the team to their gold medal at the last Olympics, hasn’t any experience in remote captaincy.Like any good leader, Pearne-Webb has already identified some positives. The delayed Games gives her and the coach, Mark Hager, another year to develop a young squad of players who have stuttered since Rio. After the retirements of the power couple Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh, Pearne-Webb’s England team were knocked out in the quarter-finals of their home World Cup in 2018.Last year, their coach in Rio, Danny Kerry, moved to oversee the men’s side and under Hager England were routed 8-0 by Holland in a record defeat in their EuroHockey semi. Back-to-back wins against Chile last autumn, to qualify finally for Tokyo, came as a considerable relief.So Pearne-Webb knows the bonding power of adversity. “These sort of things do gel you, going through tougher times. I know we’ve felt that on the pitch throughout the last four years, which have been a bit of a rollercoaster. So although we’re not together, team dynamics are pretty good and we’re pulling each other along.”The 29-year-old has always seen herself as a temporary captain, caretaking the team until the return of her good friend Alex Danson. On a holiday in Kenya two years ago, a freak accident left Danson with mild brain trauma. That life-changing injury, combined with her sister, Claire, being paralysed after a cycling accident, finally caused Danson to retire from the sport in February. “It was only then it sunk in that I would be captaining the team to the Olympics,” says Pearne-Webb. “Then I started worrying: ‘Am I doing what I should be? Am I doing a good job?’”Her self-doubts have been helped, she says, by listening to interviews given by Richardson-Walsh (“I heard her saying she only felt she got the captaincy right within the last year”) but those around her have no difficulty identifying her inspirational qualities. Pearne-Webb’s never-say-die attitude was key to her side’s Rio triumph, not least in their final match, where Great Britain spent most of the time against the Netherlands defending their hearts out. It was her ice-cool composure, taking the final penalty shuffle, that gave them victory.So Pearne-Webb knows a bit about staying calm in a crisis. She’s also an economics graduate and a part-time management accountant, working two days a week for the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs, where her role includes risk assessment and financial planning. “As someone who likes to know what’s going on, the current situation is a challenge,” she says. “But I’m breaking it down on a daily and weekly basis, what can I do right now. I like structure and routine, so I’ve been filling my calendar every night – work, study, training, lunch and a fresh-air slot where I go out for a ride on my road bike.”While she finds the economic implications of the pandemic “really quite scary”, she has taken some comfort in the way it has inspired people to think about their physical activity. “Going outside once a day you see more people running than ever. I’m hoping one of the things to come out of this is people finding a little bit more time for themselves.”Gender equality is another of Pearne-Webb’s concerns – hockey is a rare team sport in which male and female internationals are paid the same. In January she joined the Women’s Sport Trust’s Unlock campaign, aimed at breaking down the barriers that still remain for women’s sport. She foresees a real danger that recent improvements in its funding and profile could suffer in an economic downturn. “It is a worry that all the hard work and the years it’s taken to get to this point could be lost.”Before then, however, there are some more immediate priorities. These include redecorating her hallway (she finds DIY therapeutic) and gym sessions with her ready-made training partner – her husband, Tom, who secretly wishes he was a professional athlete himself. And if the BBC does respond to requests to replay past Olympic triumphs to boost the nation’s spirits, there’s a good chance we’ll get to see Pearne-Webb in action again. “It would be great if they replayed the Rio final,” she says with a smile. “Because I don’t think I’ve actually seen it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a631a717f0bad548efa27e612f27a4a1e4cbeee/0_16_2816_1690/master/2816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7171ef1dc74751111ff0f0b01e23c16f","title":"coe and ovetts olympic debt to bureaucrat who defied thatcher","story":"British Olympic Association chairman Sir Denis Follows was determined not to join the Moscow Games boycott in 1980, to the fury of the prime ministerSir Denis Follows, 71, short and bald, started every day’s work by opening his post. It was a habit he’d had as secretary of the Football Association, and a habit he kept as chairman of the British Olympic Association. In between the two jobs, he’d been knighted. Which was some going, for the son of a stationmaster, but it hadn’t changed him much. He still wore a pair of thick horn rims, still worried about putting on weight, was still the same avuncular, pragmatic man who had kept the Jules Rimet trophy under his bed and carried it out to Mexico 70 in his briefcase. And he still had the same set of principles.First among them his idea that sport was above politics. Follows was so ­adamant about this that his own daughter still isn’t sure which way he voted, and that adamancy made him one of the key figures in what the Labour parliamentarian Denis Howell described as “the most epic political battle in which I have ever been engaged”.On Tuesday 22 January 1980, Follows’s morning mail included a ­letter from the prime ­minister, Margaret Thatcher. A month ­earlier, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan six months later, the Soviet Union was due to host the Olympics. Thatcher and the US ­president, Jimmy Carter, had already decided on a boycott. Thatcher’s foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, pointed out that there was just one problem: “participation is not a ­matter for governments”, but the national Olympic associations. All the government could do was advise on a course of action.Still, when the prime minister willed it, when the president of the US wanted it, how much of a ­problem could it really be? Looking back on the Moscow boycott 40 years later, with the benefit of all Thatcher’s declassified papers, briefings and correspondence, the most striking thing about it is how this one man, Sir Denis Follows, an elderly bureaucrat, squared up to the two most ­powerful leaders in the western world and stared them down.“In an ideal world, I would share entirely the philosophy of the Olympic movement that sport should be orced from politics, sadly, however, this is no longer a realistic view,” Thatcher wrote. To go to Moscow “would be to give the ­appearance of condoning” the ­invasion. It didn’t occur to her that Follows might ­disagree. She pressed ahead with asking him to “approach the International Olympic Committee urgently and propose that the Summer Games be moved from the Soviet Union”. She was convinced the Games should be relocated and suggested Britain could co-host them.Thatcher had made a mistake here, as the West German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, took great pleasure in explaining to Carrington. Her idea to move the Games at six months’ notice was “a still-born child”, Schmidt said. “Those who proposed it had no concept of the organisation of international sport.” But she stuck with it and had a working party run up a list of available venues, even after Follows had told her that the IOC’s response to her idea was “not ­difficult to imagine”.So Thatcher ramped up her ­rhetoric. “The Soviet government hope as another government did in 1936 that the Games will give an immense boost to the state’s prestige internationally,” she told parliament. “The solution is to move the Games to a place where politics do not predominate.” (The Labour MP Eric Heffer called out: “Where’s that? The moon?”)Carter, who was facing an election in the autumn, was so glad for her support that he wrote her a “Dear Margaret” to express his “deep personal appreciation” for her speech and applaud her “leadership in launching the Olympic boycott”. In private, her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, was briefing that Thatcher had won over “the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain” to the boycott. Or so they thought.Then, on 1 February, Follows sent his full reply. There was “little or no support for the suggestion the Games be moved” he said. As for the ­boycott, it wasn’t just his decision, but had to be made by a committee of the heads of each of the inidual sports ­federations. They were due to vote on 4 March but had postponed until 25 March, because they had “no desire to embarrass the government”. Follows told Thatcher to “rest assured your views will be considered”.Thatcher didn’t “rest assured”. Three days later, the cabinet started discussing the possibility of withdrawing all their funding to the Sports Council, who funnelled public money to the BOA. It decided not to. But there were other levers to pull. The government talked to the BBC about cancelling coverage, British Airways about cancelling charter flights to Moscow and the BOA’s corporate partners about cancelling sponsorship. Bupa did and the BOA were left scrabbling to scrape together funds in a public fundraising drive, boosted by support from the unions and several Labour councils.Thatcher wrote again to Follows: “For British athletes to go would be for them to seem to condone an international crime.” She decided to deny leave to all civil service, military and police personnel who were due to compete. That, Follows said, “rather stiffened” his resolve. When he was called in to face the foreign affairs select committee, he fired back. “Boycotts never do anyone any good,” he said. “Sport helps to bridge the gulf between nations, it is the most unifying thing in the world today.” Follows did promise the BOA would “not ignore” a vote in the Commons on the boycott. But he didn’t promise they would obey it.The MPs voted for the boycott by 315 to 147. Thatcher, who had said she was astonished by Follows’s stance at the select committee, wrote to him again. She was more placatory this time. “We have the highest admiration for the Olympic ideals. It is not we who are perverting that ideal rather, it is the Soviet Union.”By now, Carter’s special counsel, Lloyd Cutler, had flown to Europe to meet Follows. Cutler was clear the success of the boycott turned on how Thatcher handled the BOA. “The prospects for the political success of the boycott remain good provided the impending British defection can be deferred or contained,” Cutler said. The problem was Follows. “Sir Denis is a living Colonel Blimp,” he told Carter. “He is a pure Olympian who puts aside all responsibilities as a ­citizen of the west in favour of sports as the last hope of world peace. His views of Mrs Thatcher and the president are visibly apoplectic.” The feeling was mutual.Follows told Cutler he was ­“perfectly willing to have the British team be the only western European team in Moscow because this would show the BOA followed Olympic principles while the others bowed to their governments” even though “he knows the effect on the British government’s prestige at home and abroad will be disastrous”.On 25 March, the BOA voted to go to the Moscow Games. “Serves her right,” said Schmidt. Thatcher warned that it was “not the end of the matter”. In the Commons, the Conservative Cranley Onslow blamed Follows’ “thick skull” for causing “a national disgrace”, and his colleague Keith Best asked Thatcher to “write a charming letter to Sir Denis Follows not necessarily describing any part of his anatomy”.But Thatcher was wrong. It was the end of the matter. The British team travelled and won 21 medals, five of them gold, for Duncan Goodhew, Daley Thompson, Allan Wells, Steve Ovett and Seb Coe, who fought their famous duels over 800m and 1500m.Thatcher conspicuously did not invite them, or anyone else, to Downing Street to celebrate. By the time the team were home, Carter’s boycott was already seen as a public relations disaster. His policy foundered on the rock of Follows’s principles. History isn’t always the work of great men, but sometimes modest, unassuming ones too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1c663977c206ed74e5a587f8d339a17258b1a05/416_261_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8a04d9b86b6de55375a8df0bf835fe","title":"ecole des femmes review moliere theatre odeon","story":"Available online A controlling fool in love comes across more like a sexual predator in this engagingly perceptive Stéphane Braunschweig production for France’s Théâtre de l’OdéonSuzanne Aubert makes quite some entrance. The first minutes of Stéphane Braunschweig’s production of Molière’s School for Wives, first seen in 2018, are a slow build-up for the big reveal. In a modern-day gym, Claude Duparfait’s Arnolphe has laid out his creepy scheme to bring up a girl in such seclusion that he may marry her, certain she will be faithful.We’re desperate to see the victim of this social engineering and, when the vast curtain iding Alexandre de Dardel’s Odéon Théâtre de l’Europe set is pulled back, we are shocked. Aubert is lying across a bed, idly cutting strips of cotton, her T-shirt scarcely reaching her knickers, her bare legs coyly kicking the air.This Agnès makes Arnolphe appear not only as a foolish control freak but as a dangerous sexual predator. It is all our #MeToo anxieties at once.As knockabout comedies go, this one is uncommonly alarming. Indeed, Braunschweig, whose Measure for Measure toured the UK in 1997, gives the whole play a rare psychological depth. He pushes beyond the stock characters of impotent old man, innocent virgin and clean-cut hero to offer something more subtle.Yes, Arnolphe remains a figure of fun. With his trim suit and bended knees, Duparfait plays him like a man comically uncomfortable in his own skin. Yet he also comes across as genuinely distressed by the unravelling of his plan. You almost feel sorry for him.Aubert’s Agnès, meanwhile, is every bit the modern woman. Her response to Arnolphe’s patriarchal opinions is to laugh uncontrollably. Who needs a big speech to reply to views so patently absurd? Inexperienced she might be, but she is a woman in charge of her own destiny.

We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …” is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.Emily Rice, Renault UK’s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers’ questions.I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I’m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, BrightonAlthough it’s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it’s far from the only option.The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. “If you’d like to buy an EV, but don’t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,” says Rice. “It’s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don’t own an EV – but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.”It’s worth noting that the notional “full charge” is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury’s or Starbucks may take a few hours – but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren’t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.If you charge an EV and then don’t use it, have you wasted your electricity? Jonathan Bailey, SheffieldThe short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. “The thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,” says Rice. “If you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you’re not going to notice a discharge. There’s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it’s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.”The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older – it won’t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.“I think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they’re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years – but it really isn’t like that,” says Rice. “We all know that a phone reaches a point where you’re having to charge it a couple of times a day – but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you’re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you’re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it’s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.”Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? Edward Jones, NorthamptonshireThe downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that’s where the market is heading.Curious to learn more about EVs?

In many ways, Macfadyen is the archetypal actor for this kind of moment, a master of shifting and ambiguous tone, whose frequent bursts of laughter often threaten to turn hollow. One of the many joys of his portrayal of the bullied and bullying son-in-law Tom Wambsgans in the HBO show Succession – arguably the defining contribution to the defining TV drama of our times – is his winning ability to switch from empathy to psychopathy in a heartbeat.Next month, Macfadyen will bring all of that gift for nuance to the three-part ITV drama Quiz, in which he plays Major Charles Ingram, the “coughing major” who was convicted of cheating his way to the top prize on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in 2001. The show, an adaptation of the West End play by James Graham, has been directed for television by Stephen Frears. Macfadyen’s major takes the hot seat across from Michael Sheen, who adds Chris Tarrant to his repertoire of uncanny impersonations.If I’m honest I hadn’t really expected to enjoy the miniseries, which I watched in preview. I felt I knew the story of the major, who was eventually convicted of the deception, along with his wife Diana and their coughing accomplice Tecwen Whittock, in a widely publicised court case, but I was wrong. Graham’s script and Frears’s direction – but above all Macfadyen’s characterisation – brings unexpected humanity as well as fabulous observational comedy to the events. It takes you back to a curious time when the whole nation was in thrall to the quiz show – audience figures peaked at 19 million – which was the first of a string of British TV formats to be sold to the American networks. Major Ingram emerges as a fall guy to the feverish obsessions of a different era. His million-pound appearance came the day before 911.Macfadyen was sent the script when he was filming the last episode of the second season of Succession onboard a superyacht off the coast of Croatia. “I’d known about the story,” he says, “but I thought I knew more about it than I did. And I knew that Sian Clifford was playing the wife – and I was a big fan of hers from Fleabag – and Stephen Frears, of course, and it was quite different from Tom Wambsgans so I immediately said yes.”One of the things that makes the drama so watchable is that it maintains some reasonable doubt about the scam itself right to the end.Even Macfadyen wasn’t quite sure what to think. “Sian and I kept sort of grabbing each other during filming going: ‘They did it! Guilty! Yeah.’ Then, five minutes later: ‘No, no, no, they didn’t!’”In some senses, I suggest, Ingram adds to Macfadyen’s gift for playing that kind of contemporary everyman who finds himself suddenly in the midst of events way beyond his control.“Yeah,” he says. “But I think we all are like that, really. We are all living by the seat of our pants to greater and lesser degrees. Even majors in the British army.”When I later speak to James Graham, who wrote the script, he describes his idea of it as “Mission Impossible, but set in a village in Wiltshire” it gave him the licence to explore a curious middle-England mix of reserve and wild-eyed obsession. He and the producers and Frears knew they had to persuade Macfadyen to take the role. “Coming from the theatre, I’d known Matthew as one of our great stage actors, but vastly underappreciated,” Graham says. “But then like everyone else, seeing him appear, or emerge, in Succession was a revelation. That is the most extraordinary performance, both buffoonish and terrifying simultaneously.”Macfadyen finds a way to play the major as both a quite conventional military man and a genuine enigma. “The real Ingram has been lampooned to a degree that I think is out of proportion to his alleged crime,” Graham says. “I think Matthew is perfect because he does have this dashing aura of a Hollywood star, but also looks and feels incredibly nice. You just like him, everyone does.”Sitting talking with Macfadyen it is hard to disagree with that impression. Nothing he says is quite in earnest, and he has a habit of laughing at your lamest joke. You can’t help thinking some of this is performance, but then feel guilty for doubting his sincerity.Macfadyen is married to Keeley Hawes, who he met when they made Spooks together. They have two children in their teens, along with a 19-year-old son from Hawes’s first marriage. The thought of actors off stage and at home, particularly when they are married to other actors, is always intriguing. Both he and Hawes can convincingly inhabit any shade of emotion. How do their arguments go?He laughs. “I am really not good without a script. I’m an absolutely hopeless fibber in real life. But even when I’m acting I never feel I am inhabiting any emotion. You are just doing what the character does.”He insists that he and Hawes are not competitive with each other, but both of them are in a rich run of TV success: Hawes with The Durrells and Line of Duty and The Bodyguard, he with Any Human Heart, and Ripper Street and Howards End, as well as Succession.He puts it down mostly to a determination to keep working.“I think the trick is keep doing good work while you wait for those roles where everything comes together,” he says. “I think Keeley had that with Line of Duty. And perhaps me with Succession.”In that philosophy, I suggest, he no doubt found a kindred spirit in Stephen Frears, who once told me he had made his remarkably varied directorial career by following the principle of simply always doing the best script that came through his letterbox.“I think so. I mean, if you’re lucky enough to get sent things and they sort of blow your hair back then, great. Quite often though my immediate thought is ‘Well, I wouldn’t cast myself as this’. Or, you know, ‘Why didn’t they ask Damian Lewis?’ But then there are some parts you think: ‘Yeah I know what makes him tick.’”And that was the case with Charles Ingram?“Yes. He’s a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks.”“Well that’s the thing, was he? The tabloid narrative was that Diana, his wife, was the sort of controller, the Lady Macbeth, but who knows? A posh cheat? We rush to know and we rush to condemn. But maybe we always need to look a bit harder.”Macfadyen did not find it hard to remain agnostic. “You are just playing incremental moments, so you can’t add a wash of guilt or innocence anyway. Now and again Stephen would say, ‘Let’s turn the dial a bit one way on their culpability and then not so much’ – just so he had options in the cutting room.”Macfadyen discovered he might have that talent quite early. His mother trained as an actor and later taught drama. They did a bit of am-dram together, including Oh! What a Lovely War, and whenever there was mention of a school play, he recalls, “my heart was immediately banging away”.His upbringing also supplied those elements of dislocation and hyper-observation that seem at the heart of his best performances. Macfadyen’s father was a physicist who became an engineer in the oil industry. They lived in places as varied as Great Yarmouth, Aberdeen, London and Jakarta. “There was a lot of me standing next to a teacher announcing ‘Say hello to Matthew, children’,” he says.He saw it as an adventure rather than any kind of trauma. “Mum and Dad were always excited by new places, so my brother and I were excited too,” he says.He was something of a prodigy, accepted at Rada at 17, and then into Declan Donnellan’s acclaimed Cheek By Jowl touring company at 21. He credits the latter in particular with opening his eyes to that magic potential of “really standing in someone else’s shoes”.“Declan is a big proponent of the idea that everything that feeds you as an actor comes from outside,” he says. “The audience pays not for you to feel things, but for you to see things. You are not summoning emotions, it is all out there in front of you.”He and Donnellan have remained friends. When I speak to the director, he recalls how he had never had such a young actor in the company before Macfadyen starred in productions of The Duchess of Malfi and Much Ado that took them all over the world together.“The thing that young actors often don’t realise,” Donnellan says, “is that if you want to get on, the first thing you need to look after is the group. Looking after me me me, on stage or off, never pays out. You have to give full attention to who you are acting with. Matthew always understood that.”He stresses one other thing that has always struck him as unusual in his experience. “Matthew always had an extraordinarily close relationship with his parents, both father and mother. They were around, somehow, when we were in Rio one time. I remember once we were rehearsing and his dad came and they sat in the cafe at the next table and I was so impressed by how easy they were with each other. I’ve never forgotten that.”Donnellan is, like everyone, addicted to Succession. “What is really wonderful about the series, is how they all are about the vacuousness of all that wealth,” he says. “It makes you want to go down on your knees and thank God that you are not rich.”It seems a telling coincidence that the cast of Succession did their first read-through of the script on the day of Donald Trump’s election victory. It felt something like an omen, for their tale of power and its discontents. “Everyone, all the Americans, kept telling us, you know, the election will be fine, he can’t win,” Macfadyen recalls. “Then we went to the producer Adam McKay’s apartment that evening to watch the results come in. There was that truly terrible moment when it became clear what was going to happen. And everyone went a bit quiet and disappeared into their phones.”Since that night, it has often appeared that something of the barely credible character of Trump’s America has been feeding directly into the two seasons of Succession almost by osmosis. No comic excess or private humiliation seems beyond either drama. “I hope so,” Macfadyen says. “There does sometimes seem some feedback. Like a horrible loop of shit, you might say.”The Roy family in the drama seem most directly based on the Murdoch dynasty, but in the nastier moments of their familial struggles they also seem to reference Trump and his dreadful sons. It captures what Brian Cox, speaking of his patriarchal role as Logan Roy, has called elsewhere, “the horrible last gasp of the alpha male in America”, the extended death throes of all that concentrated wealth, which still exerts its global influence. “It is the Bible salesman arriving in a private jet,” Macfadyen says, “and people queuing up to say: ‘Yeah, I’ll buy one of those off you’.”Among the ides in our world just now, it sometimes feels like the most significant is between those who think the worst can’t happen and those who understand that it can. Succession is cast in the no man’s land between those attitudes. Critics of the series suggest that it is hard to sympathise with any of the characters. The genius of it, it seems to me, is that however loathsome and cynical they are, you can still sympathise with all of them.“I agree,” Macfadyen says. “The Roy children are all terrified. There is an awful absence of love from the father that has taken away all of their confidence. They can never talk about their feelings, though they want to.”On the very edge of that orbit are Tom and his sidekick, cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), who understands even less of the vicious world in which they find themselves. The pair of them have become a kind of contemporary Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, tragically unsure of their roles, but scheming like everyone else.“The thing is, however badly they behave,” Macfadyen says, “they still think they are heroic, or doing their best under very difficult circumstances. Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations.”Some of the collective angst comes from the way the series is filmed.“We shoot these great long scenes, often with three cameras. And you are never sure whether the camera is on you. It feels like a play and it is liberating because you are forced to listen all the time, like you would in real life. I think we are much more affected by other people than anything inside us. That is the great thing about playing Tom – he is a totally different person with everyone he is with.”He never knows what to feel?“Except a sort of panicky ambivalence always.”Again, that seems to capture a quite contemporary sense…“Yes, I think we know life is quite scary but our vanity tells us we are in control – of our bank accounts and our careers and our relationships – until one day we are not.” He pauses for a moment. “It’s like, you know, my father died in November, quite suddenly, and when that happens the world tilts and changes for you. Everything goes off, somehow. And it’s like a lot of the world is like that now.”When we speak Macfadyen is due to head out to begin six months’ work, mostly in New York, filming series three of Succession, though no doubt by now some of that schedule has been changed along with everything else. Inevitably, we move from talking about panicky ambivalence to the current crisis.Did he have a sense of things falling apart?“No,” he says, firmly. “Of course not.” And then: “I don’t know. Maybe. I am in that situation that perhaps we are all in, that the more I read about almost anything the less informed I feel. So I keep reading. Nothing quite seems to make sense and there is nothing you can do anyway. Apart, of course, in this case, from washing your hands.” We both can’t help but laugh for a moment – it’s catching – and then, just as quickly, on cue, shrug and stop.Quiz is on ITV from 13-15 AprilSpooks, BBC (2002-2004)Long before Tom Wambsgans came Tom Quinn… After a few smaller roles, Macfadyen became known to British audiences in the first two series of the long-running MI5 drama, as the stoic chief of counter-terrorism ision Section D. It was a disciplined portrayal that gradually thawed as the episodes went by, taking Quinn from stern, focused operative to questioning outlier. The series introduced Macfadyen to his wife, Keeley Hawes: they’ve been married since 2004.In My Father’s Den (Brad McGann, 2004)Not enough people saw New Zealander Brad McGann’s heartfelt family tragedy, which gave Macfadyen his first big-screen lead and earned him a British independent film award nomination for best actor. It’s a classic prodigal son role: a feted war photographer returning to his Kiwi homeland following his father’s death, uncovering dark family secrets. The script spirals into melodrama, but Macfadyen gives it a quiet, humane and emotional core.Pride and Prejudice (Joe Wright, 2005)Many think of Colin Firth as the quintessential screen Mr Darcy, but Macfadyen was at least his equal: a more broodingly sensual take on the character, teeming with interior emotional conflict, which fits well with the unbuttoned realism of director Joe Wright’s interpretation. Costumed and styled with a scruffy dishevelment that was equal parts rakish and little-boy-lost, his performance didn’t please all die-hard Austenites, but younger viewers swooned.Anna Karenina (Joe Wright, 2012)Joe Wright has been good to Macfadyen. The actor may not be as prominently featured in this whirring, theatrical, hyper-stylised adaptation of the Tolstoy novel, but in a film of wildly variable performances, his feckless, faithless Oblonsky – brother rather than lover of Keira Knightley’s heroine this time – is one of the very best things in it. He’s a cool, dry breeze of comic relief in otherwise hot, heavy surroundings.Succession, HBO (2018-)Following a career heavy on polite British period pieces, the role of Tom Wambsgans in Jesse Armstrong’s critically adored US television drama is a wildly against-type opportunity that the actor palpably relishes. As the ambitious, obsequious third husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-inspired heiress, Macfadyen wittily plays him as both repulsive and queasily sympathetic: a hungry add-on to the Roy family who, as much as he plays their game, will never quite have their respect.Quiz, ITV (2020)Macfadyen returns to British TV next month as the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? fraudster Major Charles Ingram in Stephen Frears’s miniseries. It’s a morally and psychologically complex part well suited to the actor’s blend of vulnerability and very English propriety: his tragicomic performance is integral to making the series more than just a snarky take on a tabloid scandal. You may wind up thinking of Ingram a bit differently.

On Florida’s Atlantic coast, at the height of spring break season, the sand was deserted in the cities of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, where Democratic mayors had imposed closures to fight the spread of coronavirus.Across the narrow neck of the state, the Gulf coast beaches in Clearwater were a world apart. There the Republican mayor had declined to impose a closure, and photos that would circle the world captured the result: thousands of carefree sunbathers lining the sand and mingling in the water.The public health risk from such large gatherings was not a secret. A day earlier the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had advised against gatherings of more than 50 people, and New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, warned the coronavirus “has already spread much more than you know”.But at the time Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, like most of his 25 Republican peers across the country, did not see cause for alarm, and he has still not closed non-essential businesses statewide, despite warnings by medical professionals that coronavirus cases there could “explode”.Hundreds of US counties and all 50 states now have confirmed coronavirus cases – despite a widespread lack of testing – underscoring the indifference of the virus to the familiar political boundaries separating red states, dominated by Republicans, and blue ones, dominated by Democrats.But while the virus does not select for party affiliation, contrasting emergency responses at the state and local levels have split dramatically along partisan lines.States with Democratic governors have been quicker to declare emergencies, close schools, shutter non-essential businesses and impose limits on bars and restaurants, according to data collected by the Kaiser Foundation. Fifteen of 21 states to have issued stay-at-home orders have Democratic governors.States with Republican governors, meanwhile, have been less eager to ask businesses to close, and more likely to downplay the threat. “Go to the grocery stores. For crying out loud, go to the grocery stores,” Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia told residents on 16 March. “If you want to go to Bob Evans and eat, go to Bob Evans and eat.”The night before, Oklahoma’s Governor Kevin Stitt tweeted a picture of himself and his two sons at a restaurant, boasting: “It’s packed tonight.” The tweet was later deleted.The ergence in state responses to coronavirus does not cleanly split along the red-blue line, with Republican governors in states such as Ohio and Maryland among the most proactive in responding to the threat, said University of Southern California professor Manuel Pastor.“It’s more like the rational states versus the Trump Republican states,” Pastor said.All partisan disagreements in the United States in 2020 seem to emanate from or end with Donald Trump. But the president has encouraged a partisan ide on the coronavirus threat, analysts said, pitting state governors against each other and setting off bidding wars for medical equipment.While states and localities have primary responsibilities for public health under the American system of federalism, the president has an important role in focusing the national attention on the emergency and channeling the massive resources of the federal government to the states most in need, said Lawrence O Gostin, a professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins University.“This is something that’s really unprecedented and clearly American federalism is not well equipped to do it. You need every oar to work together. We have fragmentation, name-calling and wildly different responses,” Gostin said.Because past disasters were locally confined, states were able to help each other, by sending firefighters to combat wildfires in California, by sending first responders to help in New York after September 11, or by accepting refugees from Hurricane Katrina.“This is almost like we have a hurricane,” Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has moved aggressively on coronavirus, said on the radio show of the former New Jersey governor on Thursday. “But it’s hitting every single state in the country at the same time, and it’s been hitting them for 21 days, at least in our state.”Citizens judge the viral threat according to their politics, polling indicates. More Democrats than Republicans have told pollsters they were “extremely concerned” about coronavirus by a 20-point margin. A poll released on Friday showed that viewers of conservative Fox News, which spent weeks downplaying and dismissing the virus, were much less likely to take the pandemic seriously.“The idea that states can decide particular local issues on a wide range of things allows for such variation,” said Pastor. “That’s, of course, kind of stupid, in the context of the pandemic, because when one state has lax standards, then you wind up maintaining the infection in another location.”That picture is likely to change in the coming weeks, however. Governors in some non-coastal states have taken aggressive action against the virus, including Kentucky’s Andrew Beshear, a Democrat, and Ohio’s Mike DeWine, a Republican.While Kentucky was quick to set up lab testing for the virus and declared a state of emergency on 6 March, the governor nextdoor, Republican Bill Lee of Tennessee, waited a week longer to declare a state of emergency.In Ohio, DeWine became one of the first governors in the country to order bars and restaurants to close and limit large gatherings, while the Democratic governor of neighboring Michigan was slower to issue restrictions. As of last week, Ohio had recorded 351 cases, compared with 1,035 for Michigan – although variations in testing obscure the picture.“I think it’s impossible to talk about a Covid epidemic in the United States,” said Gostin. “We’d have to say it’s Covid epidemics. Because the epidemics will vary state by state, and the response will vary state by state.”It is “crucially urgent” for the Trump administration to coordinate aid for the states and for the president to use his bully pulpit to focus the national attention, said Gostin.“That should have been happening several weeks ago,” he said. “The longer we wait without having a properly coordinated national approach the worse the disaster will unfold in the United States.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f38a51f256ea8452102dbba793b058aed03fe57/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a55c968785a506f643ab541a57a75bd3","title":"detainees coronavirus us immigration ice","story":"Recordings obtained by  reveal people in Ice centers in the south concerned they are not being properly cared forDetainees at immigration detention centers across the American south have alleged heavy-handed crackdowns amid increasing panic and protest over the coronavirus pandemic, according to advocates and recordings of detainees obtained by the .A number of detainees have expressed concern they are not being properly cared for in packed detention centers. Former senior immigration officials and attorneys have called for the release of nonviolent detainees. Judges in New Jersey, New York and California have ordered the release of small numbers, based on health concerns.“People are terrified for their lives and think that they’re going to die there,” said Phoebe Lytle, a law student volunteer who has spoken with detainees at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facilities in Louisiana. “I don’t think anyone is saying it in a light or flippant way.”Jaclyn Cole, an outreach paralegal at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), said she was called on Tuesday by a Cuban asylum seeker who said officers dressed in riot gear were shooting rubber bullets and using chemical agents on detainees after a dispute with guards.During the five-minute call to Pine Prairie Ice processing center, Cole said she heard between 10 and 15 shots.Ice spokesperson Bryan D Cox did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has previously denied that the privately operated facility possesses rubber bullets, after detainees have reported their use. Cox did confirm to Mother Jones that seven people at Pine Prairie were pepper-sprayed on Tuesday.Elsewhere in Louisiana, guards at the LaSalle Ice center allegedly sprayed a man with what he called “toxic gas” on Monday after two other detainees cautioned detainees to forgo meals because food could carry Covid-19. The man was hospitalized, said Verónica Fernández, a project coordinator with the SPLC’s Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative.Cox did not respond to a request for comment on that incident. He did confirm a separate use of force at LaSalle on Wednesday to Buzzfeed News.Since Covid-19 started spreading through the US, health and immigration experts have expressed concern that Ice is unequipped to deal with the crisis. The US runs the largest immigration detention system in the world and there is a well-documented record of infections ballooning into outbreaks in such facilities. Now, coronavirus has infected some of the agency’s employees and detainees, which experts said was inevitable.Two detainees in New Jersey Ice facilities and five employees at four facilities in Texas, Colorado and New Jersey have confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Ice. No cases have been publicly announced in southern states.The Trump administration has massively expanded the use of immigration detention facilities, with hardline policies that have driven the detention population to record highs. States in the deep south have opened more new facilities than anywhere else.Advocates say immigrants held in Louisiana suspect Covid-19 has reached their facilities as the state becomes a major virus hotspot. At Ice’s South Louisiana center, a woman alleged she saw officers in hazmat suits feeding someone through a slot in a door, Cole said. At LaSalle, Fernández said, a dorm has reportedly been quarantined, and detainees believe two people have the disease.“They’re not giving people what they need to protect themselves, and that is social distancing,” said Fernández. “That’s not something people can do in detention.”Ice has said detainees’ “health, welfare and safety … is one of the agency’s highest priorities”.“Since the onset of reports of Covid-19, Ice epidemiologists have been tracking the outbreak, regularly updating infection prevention and control protocols, and issuing guidance to Ice Health Service Corps (IHSC) staff for the screening and management of potential exposure among detainees,” according to the agency’s website.Some detainees believe they will not receive fair treatment in government care. In a recorded call from Richwood correctional center in Louisiana, released by the Southeast Immigrant Rights Network and the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice and shared with the , one detainee said: “They’re not going to take a facemask from anyone, from any American, to put it on an immigrant. This means we are going to die.”Advocates say anyone in detention is likely to have a compromised immune system, but some also have pre-existing conditions. Lytle said she spoke to a 61-year-old asthmatic at Jackson Parish correctional center, another facility used by Ice in Louisiana, whom she said was “very, very worried” and called to tell her people in his dorm were refusing meals.A woman named Denisse, whose husband is at Stewart detention center in Georgia, feared what might happen as new detainees arrived and guards came and went.“It’s just spreading rapidly, you know?” Denisse said. “And his immune system is already weak.”Her husband has a pre-existing condition that has become worse since he arrived at the facility in September, she said, adding that he recently underwent a procedure and uses a catheter. She shook with relief when she learned he would be released on Monday. The reason for his release was unclear.Hilda Jorge Perez, whose husband is at Richwood, said he had heart problems and high blood pressure. She worried that if he got infected, she would not be able to see him.Perez’s husband was among at least 60 people who staged a hunger strike earlier this week. The protesters were forced to end the strike after officials told them they would be put in Ice’s version of solitary confinement and have phone and television privileges removed, Perez said.Detainees at Stewart planned a similar strike. They demanded they either be released or deported instead of waiting to be infected, according to recordings of calls provided by a North Carolina advocacy group.“We’re not going to eat until Ice comes here and gives us answers, and gives us a solution,” one man said.A spokesperson for Ice accused advocates of circulating rumors about a hunger strike at Stewart, which she said never happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f66c76333b0d234d377cd400abec830916999b/0_0_7272_4364/master/7272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df7e11d835b9a3c6c1e35328f6254f6","title":"a letter to the uk from italy this is what we know about your future","story":"An author in Rome describes what to expect based on her experiences of lockdownThe acclaimed Italian novelist Francesca Melandri, who has been under lockdown in Rome for almost three weeks due to the Covid-19 outbreak, has written a letter to fellow Europeans “from your future”, laying out the range of emotions people are likely to go through over the coming weeks.I am writing to you from Italy, which means I am writing from your future. We are now where you will be in a few days. The epidemic’s charts show us all entwined in a parallel dance.We are but a few steps ahead of you in the path of time, just like Wuhan was a few weeks ahead of us. We watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say “it’s only a flu, why all the fuss?” and those who have already understood.As we watch you from here, from your future, we know that many of you, as you were told to lock yourselves up into your homes, quoted Orwell, some even Hobbes. But soon you’ll be too busy for that.First of all, you’ll eat. Not just because it will be one of the few last things that you can still do.You’ll find dozens of social networking groups with tutorials on how to spend your free time in fruitful ways. You will join them all, then ignore them completely after a few days.You’ll pull apocalyptic literature out of your bookshelves, but will soon find you don’t really feel like reading any of it.You’ll eat again. You will not sleep well. You will ask yourselves what is happening to democracy.You’ll have an unstoppable online social life – on Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom…You will miss your adult children like you never have before the realisation that you have no idea when you will ever see them again will hit you like a punch in the chest.Old resentments and falling-outs will seem irrelevant. You will call people you had sworn never to talk to ever again, so as to ask them: “How are you doing?” Many women will be beaten in their homes.You will wonder what is happening to all those who can’t stay home because they don’t have one. You will feel vulnerable when going out shopping in the deserted streets, especially if you are a woman. You will ask yourselves if this is how societies collapse. Does it really happen so fast? You’ll block out these thoughts and when you get back home you’ll eat again.You will put on weight. You’ll look for online fitness training.You’ll laugh. You’ll laugh a lot. You’ll flaunt a gallows humour you never had before. Even people who’ve always taken everything dead seriously will contemplate the absurdity of life, of the universe and of it all.You will make appointments in the supermarket queues with your friends and lovers, so as to briefly see them in person, all the while abiding by the social distancing rules.You will count all the things you do not need.The true nature of the people around you will be revealed with total clarity. You will have confirmations and surprises.Literati who had been omnipresent in the news will disappear, their opinions suddenly irrelevant some will take refuge in rationalisations which will be so totally lacking in empathy that people will stop listening to them. People whom you had overlooked, instead, will turn out to be reassuring, generous, reliable, pragmatic and clairvoyant.Those who invite you to see all this mess as an opportunity for planetary renewal will help you to put things in a larger perspective. You will also find them terribly annoying: nice, the planet is breathing better because of the halved CO2 emissions, but how will you pay your bills next month?You will not understand if witnessing the birth of a new world is more a grandiose or a miserable affair.You will play music from your windows and lawns. When you saw us singing opera from our balconies, you thought “ah, those Italians”. But we know you will sing uplifting songs to each other too. And when you blast I Will Survive from your windows, we’ll watch you and nod just like the people of Wuhan, who sung from their windows in February, nodded while watching us.Many of you will fall asleep vowing that the very first thing you’ll do as soon as lockdown is over is file for orce.Many children will be conceived.Your children will be schooled online. They’ll be horrible nuisances they’ll give you joy.Elderly people will disobey you like rowdy teenagers: you’ll have to fight with them in order to forbid them from going out, to get infected and die.You will try not to think about the lonely deaths inside the ICU.You’ll want to cover with rose petals all medical workers’ steps.You will be told that society is united in a communal effort, that you are all in the same boat. It will be true. This experience will change for good how you perceive yourself as an inidual part of a larger whole.Class, however, will make all the difference. Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden or in an overcrowded housing project will not be the same. Nor is being able to keep on working from home or seeing your job disappear. That boat in which you’ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was.At some point, you will realise it’s tough. You will be afraid. You will share your fear with your dear ones, or you will keep it to yourselves so as not to burden them with it too.You will eat again.We’re in Italy, and this is what we know about your future. But it’s just small-scale fortune-telling. We are very low-key seers.If we turn our gaze to the more distant future, the future which is unknown both to you and to us too, we can only tell you this: when all of this is over, the world won’t be the same."},{"url":null,"title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"For our second episode we want to focus on work, and what the Covid-19 outbreak has done to it.

How did it get to a food market in Wuhan, China, from where it is thought to have spilled over into humans? The answers to these questions are gradually being pieced together, and the story they tell makes for uncomfortable reading.Let’s start at the beginning. As of 17 March, we know that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (a member of the coronavirus family that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19) is the product of natural evolution. A study of its genetic sequence, conducted by infectious disease expert Kristian G Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and colleagues, rules out the possibility that it could have been manufactured in a lab or otherwise engineered. Puff go the conspiracy theories.The next step is a little less certain, but it seems likely that the original animal reservoir for the virus was bats. Andersen’s team showed – like the Chinese before them –that the sequence of Sars-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that infect bats.Since other bat coronaviruses have transited to humans via an intermediate animal host, it seems likely that this one did too. That animal was probably one that some Chinese people like to eat, and that is therefore sold in “wet” markets (those that sell fresh meat, fish, seafood and other produce). This animal may have been the scaly mammal called a pangolin. That can’t be conclusively proved, but several groups have found sequence similarities between Sars-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that infect pangolins.If this is indeed the route the virus took to humans, it has two critical interfaces: one between us and the intermediate host, possibly a pangolin, and one between that host and bats. Most of the attention so far has been focused on the interface between humans and the intermediate host, with fingers of blame being pointed at Chinese wet markets and eating habits, but both interfaces were required for the pandemic to ignite. So where and how did the spillover from the bat to the pangolin – or other wild or semi-wild intermediate host – occur?“Our study does not directly shed light on the geographical origin of the virus,” says Andersen. “However, all the available evidence shows that it was inside China.”Case closed then, and President Trump is right to call Sars-CoV-2 the “Chinese virus”. Well, no, because if you want to understand why this pandemic happened now and not, say, 20 years ago – since Chinese people’s taste for what we in the west consider exotic fare is not new – you have to include a number of other factors. “We can blame the object – the virus, the cultural practice – but causality extends out into the relationships between people and ecology,” says evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace of the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps in St Paul, Minnesota.Starting in the 1990s, as part of its economic transformation, China ramped up its food production systems to industrial scale. One side effect of this, as anthropologists Lyle Fearnley and Christos Lynteris have documented, was that smallholding farmers were undercut and pushed out of the livestock industry. Searching for a new way to earn a living, some of them turned to farming “wild” species that had previously been eaten for subsistence only. Wild food was formalised as a sector, and was increasingly branded as a luxury product. But the smallholders weren’t only pushed out economically. As industrial farming concerns took up more and more land, these small-scale farmers were pushed out geographically too – closer to uncultivable zones. Closer to the edge of the forest, that is, where bats and the viruses that infect them lurk. The density and frequency of contacts at that first interface increased, and hence, so did the risk of a spillover.It’s true, in other words, that an expanding human population pushing into previously undisturbed ecosystems has contributed to the increasing number of zoonoses – human infections of animal origin – in recent decades. That has been documented for Ebola and HIV, for example. But behind that shift has been another, in the way food is produced. Modern models of agribusiness are contributing to the emergence of zoonoses.Take flu, a disease that is considered to have high pandemic potential, having caused an estimated 15 pandemics in the past 500 years. “There is clearly a link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and intensified poultry production systems,” says spatial epidemiologist Marius Gilbert of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.The reasons, many of which were documented in Wallace’s 2016 book Big Farms Make Big Flu, include the density with which chickens, turkeys or other poultry are packed into factory farms, and the fact that the birds in a given farm tend to be near genetic clones of one another – having been selected over decades for desirable traits such as lean meat. If a virus gets introduced into such a flock, it can race through it without meeting any resistance in the form of genetic variants that prevent its spread. Both experimental manipulations and observations in the real world have demonstrated that this process can result in a ratcheting up of the virus’s virulence. If it then spills over into humans, we are potentially in trouble.In a paper published in 2018, Gilbert’s group reviewed historical “conversion events”, as they call them – when a not-very-pathogenic avian flu strain became much more dangerous, and found that most of them had occurred in commercial poultry systems, and more frequently in wealthy countries. Europe, Australia and the US had generated more of them than China.That doesn’t let China off the hook. Two highly pathogenic forms of avian flu – H5N1 and H7N9 – have emerged in that country in recent decades. Both infect humans, though not easily (yet). The first human cases of H7N9 were reported in 2013, and there were small annual outbreaks thereafter. But, says Gilbert, “nothing was done until the virus turned out to be pathogenic for chickens as well. Then it became an important economic issue and China started to mass-vaccinate its poultry against H7N9, and that ended the transmission to humans.”China is one of the world’s major exporters of poultry, but its poultry industry is not wholly Chinese-owned. After the recession of 2008, for example, New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs ersified its holdings and moved into Chinese poultry farms. So if China has its share of responsibility for spillover events, it isn’t alone. That is why Wallace insists on talking about relational geographies rather than absolute geographies, when it comes to identifying the causes of disease. Or as he puts it: “Follow the money.”Not everybody sees a straightforward link between factory farming and new and dangerous forms of flu. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, points out that before they were brought into factory farms, poultry were kept outside. The factory model may ramp up virulence, he says, but it probably protects a flock from being infected by a virus in the first place.Still, Worobey doesn’t doubt that farming and other human-animal interactions have shaped our disease ecology. His group collects the sequences of flu viruses from a range of animal hosts, including humans, and plots them on a family treeto try to understand how flu has evolved over time. Flu is constantly mutating – that’s the reason the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year – but it mutates at different rates in different hosts, which means that his flu family tree is informative both about the parentage and intermediate host of each strain and about the approximate timing of past spillover events.It’s possible – though by no means certain – that flu first became a disease of humans after the Chinese domesticated ducks about 4,000 years ago – drawing that animal reservoir into human communities for the first time. But humans can also catch flu from, and give flu to, pigs – another animal we have lived alongside for millennia. A few years ago, Worobey suggested – controversially – that birds might not always have been the main intermediate host for human flu viruses. Until about a century ago, he reported, people may have caught flu from horses. Around the time that motor vehicles supplanted horses as transport, poultry farming was expanding in the western hemisphere, and it’s possible, Worobey argued, that birds then took over as the main intermediate host of flu for humans.Not everyone buys that scenario. Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London, says that if horses were once the main intermediate host for flu, “most avian viruses would contain the mammalian adaptation”, and they don’t. David Morens of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, thinks that it is more likely that the horse was a temporary detour, and that the main intermediate host of flu for humans has always been birds – especially wild ones. But all agree that humans have shaped these host-pathogen relationships, through our use of land and other animal species. And as Worobey points out, the sheer size of the human population today means that in the 21st century, we are doing so on an unprecedented scale. He estimates, for example, that domesticated ducks probably outnumber wild ones by now.And we’re not just talking about birds. Gilbert believes a ratcheting up of viral virulence is happening in pig herds, too. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a disease of pigs that was first described in the US in the late 1980s, has since spread to herds across the worldand strains detected recently in China are more virulent than the early American ones. A 2015 study carried out by Martha Nelson of the US National Institutes of Health and colleagues mapped the genetic sequences of swine flu viruses and found that Europe and the US – the largest global exporters of pigs – are also the largest exporters of swine flu.There have been claims on social media, sometimes posted by vegans, that if we ate less meat there would have been no Covid-19. Interestingly, some of these have been blocked by mainstream news organisations as “partly false”. But the claims are also partly true. Though the links they draw are too simplistic, the evidence is now strong that the way meat is produced – and not just in China – contributed to Covid-19.It is clear that to prevent or at least slow the emergence of new zoonoses, as Fearnley and Lynteris have argued, China’s wet markets will need to be better regulated. But we also need to look behind those markets, at how our food is produced globally.Though it may not feel like it now, Wallace says, we have been lucky with Sars-CoV-2. It appears to be far less lethal that either H7N9 – which kills around a third of those it infects – or H5N1, which kills even more. This gives us an opportunity, he says, to question our lifestyle choices – because chicken isn’t cheap if it costs a million lives – and vote for politicians who hold agribusiness to higher standards of ecological, social and epidemiological sustainability. “Hopefully,” he says, “this will change our notions about agricultural production, land use and conservation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0abc4373e8da3f7c6425dbc75b022107d49daa1b/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee93bebc30783515f0357b15b6139ef","title":"popes blessing in empty st peters square watched by 11m on tv","story":"Hour-long address came as Italy said 969 people had died from Covid-19 in 24 hoursMore than 11 million people tuned in to watch Pope Francis deliver a blessing in an empty Saint Peter’s Square, television bosses have said, as the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the EU risked losing its purpose.The pope’s blessing, Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world)is usually reserved for Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, with thousands flocking to take part. Images of the cloudy sky and the glistening square on Saturday, with the pope, alone, praying upon a platform illuminated by the faint light of six candelabras, travelled the world over. “For weeks now it has been evening,” he said. “Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities it has taken over our lives.”“The pandemic has reminded us that we are all in the same boat,” he added. “The storm exposes our vulnerability and uncovers those false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedules.”“And now that we are in a stormy sea, we implore you: wake up, Lord!”The hour-long blessing, which started at 6pm on Friday, was punctuated by moments of dramatic silence with the pope, standing, intent on praying, behind the famous “Miraculous Crucifix”, a wooden cross kept in the Church of Saint Marcellus which, according to devout Roman Catholics, saved Rome from the plague in 1522.According to official data from the broadcasting groups Rai, Sky and TV2000, the event was viewed by more than 11 million people. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus emergency in Italy, the number of viewers of live broadcasts of the pope’s prayers has increased, in part because the government’s stringent measures to halt the spread of coronavirus include the cessation of all masses, funerals and weddings.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 28 March, more than 595,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 27,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 9,000 fatalities, and there have been over 5,000 deaths in Spain. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 130,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.On Friday, Italy recorded its single biggest leap in coronavirus deaths, announcing that 969 people had died from Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours.The country also became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching 86,498 cases. That included 66,414 current infections, up 4,401 from Thursday.Conte warned on Saturday that the European Union could lose its purpose if it failed to come up with a strong response to the coronavirus threat and accused other member states of a timid response to an unprecedented economic shock.Meeting via a video-link, Conte aired his grievances after the 27 EU leaders could not agree on an action plan during an argumentative six-hour video conference on Thursday and gave their finance ministers two more weeks to forge a policy that could please Italy and Spain.“If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’être to the people,” Conte told Saturday’s edition of the Il Sole 24 Ore financial newspaper.“We are at a critical point in European history,” Conte added, “I represent a country that is suffering a lot and I cannot afford to procrastinate.”Rome and Madrid want the EU to start issuing “corona bonds” - a form of common debt that governments sell on markets to raise money and address inidual economic needs.

The team is headed by Masoom Stanekzai, an ex-security chief and supporter of president Ashraf Ghani, and includes politicians, former officials and representatives of civil society. Five members are women.“In order to reach true and lasting peace, the aforementioned team must be agreed upon by all effective Afghan sides so that it can represent all sides,” said Mujahid.The United States, which ousted the Taliban from power in 2001, signed a troop withdrawal deal with the group in February. But progress on moving to talks between the militants and the Afghan government has been delayed by a feud between Afghan politicians, and disagreement between the Taliban and the government over prisoner releases and a possible ceasefire.The spokeswoman for the Afghan ministry of peace affairs, Najia Anwari, said the Taliban’s stance was unjustified, as the negotiating team had been appointed after wide consultations among Afghan society.Ghani’s political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, has not confirmed whether he will support the delegation, which is potentially important given his camp’s strong influence in the north and west. Abdullah’s spokesman, Fraidoon Khwazoon, said that although the announced list was not final and there were “considerations that needed to be addressed”, it should not be rejected outright. “All sides including the Taliban should try not to lose the available opportunity for peace, by make illogical excuses. The Taliban should not lose the current opportunity.”The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.

The prime minister told reporters on Sunday night members of the same household could still mingle together both inside and outside, but a limit of two would be set for all other interactions, and the limits would be enforced by authorities in New South Wales and Victoria.Underpinning the new limit on gatherings, public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks would be closed from Monday, and group boot camps are no longer permitted.With the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases now heading towards 4,000, and 16 fatalities recorded, Morrison told reporters on Sunday night Australians now needed to stay home unless they were shopping for food and other essentials, attending medical appointments, exercising, or attending work or education.He said the “strong advice” was also that people aged 70 and over “should stay at home and self-isolate for their own protection”. The same advice applied to people over 60 with a chronic illness, and Indigenous people over the age of 50.Morrison said it was important for some retail outlets to remain open for now to allow people to gather essential items ahead of further social distancing restrictions, but he warned further closure of businesses was imminent. “As time goes on the national cabinet will continue to look at a lot of these businesses and may have to make further decisions in these areas, and in some cases that may not be too far from now.”The prime minister said Australians needed to adjust their habits. “When you are going out for shopping, you should be going for just stuff you need and do it and get home.“It is not a time for browsing. It is not a time for catching up with friends or bumping into people and having a long conversation and maybe drawing a few other friends across to catch up on how is it all going.“No, you can’t do that anymore. That is what we have to stop doing.”The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the goal of the tightened restrictions was to isolate confirmed cases and embark on contact tracing. He said the rate of new infections had slowed, but the positive trend was not enough to declare any breakthrough. “We have to slow it further and we have to stop the thing that’s worrying us most, which is community transmissions.”Sunday night’s announcements include a moratorium on evictions of people as a result of financial distress for the next six months under state laws.Canberra continues to work on other elements of a rental relief package. Morrison said commercial landlords and tenants needed “to sit down, talk to each other and work this out”, and he said banks had a role to play.“We need landlords and tenants to sit down and come up with arrangements that enable them to get through this crisis so on the other side, the landlord has a tenant, which is a business that can pay rent, and the business is a business that can re-emerge on the other side of this and be able to go on and employ people,” the prime minister said.“We want the banks to help them achieve this outcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529457fd5c774e54a2caeec3f740806e5ee80765/0_180_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f95dbdf7f44be05a22fa57282c667ea2","title":"broadband providers to lift data caps during covid 19 lockdown","story":"Telecoms industry will relax data limits and lower prices to protect the vulnerableAll data allowance caps on current fixed broadband services will be removed in a deal struck by the government and telecommunications companies to help vulnerable people stay connected through the pandemic.It is among a range of immediately effective measures agreed by major internet service and mobile providers including BTEE, Openreach, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk, O2, Vodafone, Three, Hyperoptic, Gigaclear, and KCOM.The companies have pledged that anyone who is struggling to pay their bill due to the pandemic will be treated fairly and appropriately supported, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said.The firms have also agreed to offer generous new mobile and landline packages to ensure people are connected and the most vulnerable continue to be supported.

Now, Candace Bushnell, author of Sex and the City and the inspiration for Carrie Bradshaw, has written a new novel based on her own experiences of inappropriate male behaviour, inspired by #MeToo.Rules for Being a Girl, which will be published next month, is Bushnell’s first work of fiction aimed at young adults. In it, a teen’s life is turned upside down when her high school teacher attempts to kiss her, mirroring Bushnell’s own experience at college, when professors making passes at her was “a regular occurrence”.Bushnell told the Observer she and her co-author, the feminist teen writer Katie Cotugno had been inspired by the #MeToo movement and the real lives of teenage girls today. “It’s more overtly feminist than my other books. There’s an openness to these kinds of stories that wasn’t there 10 years ago ... In the past, if you wanted to write something that was more feminist, you were highly discouraged by publishers.”Now, more than 25 years since she started writing the column in the New York Observer that would become the smash-hit book and TV series, it is a more acceptable theme, she says. “It’s something that young women are much more aware of. It seems like every generation has to relearn feminism.”Bushnell, who was born in Connecticut in 1958 and moved to New York in the 1970s, never had children herself and says she has never regretted her decision. “The opposite is true,” she wrote on Twitter last year in response to a particularly gloating MailOnline headline.Her new book tries to warn girls born in the 21st century about the challenges they may face, in particular the sexist behaviour they encounter at school. “One of the things the book captures is typical high-school sexism. It can be a place that’s very regimented in terms of what’s acceptable behaviour for each sex,” Bushnell said.The protagonist, Marin, for example, begins to question the way her boyfriend and his friends treat her and how all the books she reads are by “old white men”. She starts a feminist book club at her school and publishes an article in her school paper, outlining the contradictory rules teenage girls are expected to live by. “I think this is a book that hopefully, teenage girls will put down and say: ‘hmm, this is something to think about, this is something to discuss’,” she said.Bushnell says that, as a young woman, she had her “fair share” of powerful men propositioning her: “It didn’t happen to me in high school, but it did happen quite a bit in college ... And it used to happen in the workplace all the time – to me, and to pretty much every other woman I know.”She began to notice a pattern in the behaviour of these men, which she details in her novel: “It always starts off with a little tiny thing, like they ask for a kiss or they try and get you alone. And you think: ‘oh well, maybe that’s OK.’ And then it goes a little bit further. And a little bit further.”She wanted to reflect those experiences in Rules for Being a Girl, to prepare young women for the encounters they may face: “It’s about being aware of these kinds of behaviours. It can happen to anybody. People often think: ‘oh, it will never happen to me’ but at first it’s so subtle ... And if it wasn’t for #MeToo, it would probably still be going on.”She thinks people are much more aware of what’s unacceptable behaviour now and women feel more empowered to call it out: “Whereas before, it was hushed up. You were told: don’t say anything.”For example, in publishing, there was often pressure on female writers to sleep with the editor, she says. “Getting the job in some way required stroking this guy’s ego. I’m not interested in doing that. Stroke my fucking ego. That’s my feeling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:More than 30,800 people have died after contracting Covid-19, from more than 664,000 confirmed cases.

But he backed off after the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said sealing off the states would amount to “a federal declaration of war”. The US CDC then issued an urgent warning, effective immediately, against all non-essential domestic travel in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut for 14 days. The order was due to “extensive community transmission” in the areas.

People are still pushing past me or leaning across me to get something on the shelf, rather than waiting for me to move out of their way.I am on the till. A couple of people exceed the amount they are allowed to buy, and when I tell them, they swear at me. Abuse towards shop workers is quite prevalent in general, and it’s getting worse due to the outbreak.There are fewer gaps on the shelves, and the shop is quieter. It is the first day I feel the message about staying in is slowly starting to get through. But then I see couples still bringing their kids into the shop. Surely one of them could stay at home with their children while the other goes shopping.An elderly gentleman is told he needs to stand behind the line while packing his shopping. He makes comments like, “Oh, who makes these stupid bloody rules?” But then a man comes up and says he wants to thank us all for what we are doing. When you get one customer like that, you can forget about five of the abusers. This disease targets everyone, of all ages. I’ve seen patients in their 30s really sick with the heart complications you get with Covid-19, and fit and well patients in their 40s and 50s who are very sick. People are kidding themselves if they think they’re safe. So it was weird, before the lockdown, seeing the streets completely packed.Still seeing people on my way to work ignoring the lockdown blew my mind. The big challenge with managing Covid-19 patients is that it’s not obvious when they’re deteriorating. That’s heartbreaking. Patients seem blissfully unaware they may be about to die. I have the day off, which I spend reading guidance on the disease and listening to a podcast for non-intensive-care doctors about how to, for example, manage a ventilator. I want to be good at my job in the months ahead and aware of every possible challenge I am likely to encounter.Back at work. I have asthma, and my personal protective equipment is just a plastic gown, a pair of gloves and a surgical mask. It’s pretty alarming going in to see a patient who’s coughing their lungs out, and all you’ve got is a piece of paper over your mouth. But Public Health England says that’s all I need. I have got to trust that recommendation, and I do.I arrive at work for a night shift. More than 10 people with Covid-19 symptoms are waiting for beds. They all have an oxygen requirement. It gets busy but we remain in control throughout. I have confidence in our ability to manage this. My advice to people is: cherish the moments you have with your family. Because if you die from this, you die alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70d1089045ae0ac1977778ccd0fe8e8a63c83865/0_162_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a98c37af3af2f2d5d019570fbf61c733","title":"this is not the time for blame we need to get ahead of the pandemic","story":"In a rapidly evolving situation, we must think ahead and react fast, says a special envoy of the WHO director generalCovid-19 is a new virus. Its high transmission rate and rapid exponential growth make its effects particularly serious. We are seeing how, in country after country, this is now far more than a public health issue. Politicians everywhere are having to balance their responses to the health consequences of Covid-19 with the needs of their economies and societies. The interactions are complex and can be highly contextual as differences in the strength of the economy, the age of the population and local health systems and society all interact. People and businesses are hurting and fearful for the future.There are many lessons from countries where the disease appeared early in the pandemic, but global leaders also need to be aware of the global context. It is right that we scrutinise our leaders’ actions, but it is right because we all need to learn quickly, and to improve our responses. In such a rapidly evolving situation it is far too early to judge what has worked and what has not. What is critical is that we develop our actions fast in response to new information.We need to focus our attention forward to get ahead of this pandemic. If we don’t, there could be serious consequences for social welfare and stability, and for people’s livelihoods. It is vital that we choose strategies that make the best use of the time we have gained by locking down two billion people in about 40 countries.We know from what we have learned about this pandemic in China, South Korea and Singapore, that exiting lockdown is not straightforward. We will see repeated new outbreaks of the disease in areas we thought were clear. Each subsequent infection will need a rigorous approach to testing, tracing and response.This will require us to have in place public health responses that allow us to react rapidly to fresh outbreaks. We must hone our ability to identify cases through quick access to testing. We must have systems for quickly tracing contacts and testing them. We must ensure high observance of isolation.We need to support people in our communities whose lives are compromised by these measures. This is not simply about financial support. We need to ensure social support is available for the elderly and those needing frequent care. The outpouring of support we heard as people came to their windows to clap our NHS staff and carers must be translated into activity that will allow us to weather the coming challenges.So our focus must be on ensuring that we understand as best we can the emerging information that comes to us in the months and years ahead. At some point, we may look back and wish we had chosen a different path. But for now, speed and solidarity based on what we are learning are more important than chasing perfection. If we want to reduce the effect of subsequent infections, we need to be fast, well connected and sensitive to the collective struggles of billions of people rather than apportioning blame. Most of all, we must ensure that what we do leaves us with no regrets.David Nabarro is co-director of the Imperial College Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London, and one of six special envoys of the WHO director general on Covid-19"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9750dcb3a862471792d04cd732b7e76fa5a38f0d/310_284_3172_1903/master/3172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b560ca23e0744a733f65e16839c37c4","title":"us awol from world stage as china tries on global leadership for size","story":"Mike Pompeo labelling the virus ‘Chinese’ has added to lack of international cooperationWhen the UN security council and the G7 group sought to agree a global response to the coronavirus pandemic, the efforts stumbled on the US insistence on describing the threat as distinctively Chinese.There are other reasons for the lack of collaboration in the face of a global crisis, but the focus on labelling the virus Chinese and blaming China pursued by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, helped ensure there would be no meaningful collective response from the world’s most powerful nations.For some US allies, the fixation on words at a time when the international order was arguably facing its greatest challenge since the second world war encapsulated the glaring absence of US leadership.And that absence was illustrated just as vividly by news coverage of planes full of medical supplies from China arriving in Italy, at a time when the US was quietly flying in half a million Italian-made diagnostic swabs for use in its own under-equipped health system and Donald Trump was on the phone to the South Korean president pressing him to send test kits.“To me what is so striking is the complete absence of the US from public debates. The US is basically off the map, and China very much is on the map,” Nathalie Tocci, the director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs and a former EU policy adviser, said.“Whatever happens in the US elections, what is happening now is going to linger on, simply because what we’re going through now is such a traumatic experience … It is going to remain very much in our inidual and collective memories.”However, at a time when the scale of the damage is being measured in trillions, the additional aid has done little to soften the image of an administration that has employed xenophobic rhetoric and breaking with its closest partners in its efforts to intensify economic pressure on its enemies, Iran and Venezuela, whose populations are at high risk from the coronavirus.Despite its responsibility for allowing the virus to run rampant in the first place, China has had notable success in reshaping its image as a leader by its later efforts to contain the disease and its outreach to Italy and other vulnerable countries.“US global leadership won’t just end because they bungled their response to the coronavirus, but I think we will come to find that this was a pivotal point,” said Elisabeth Braw, the director of the Modern Deterrence Project at the Royal United Service Institute in London.Braw argued that the coronavirus crisis will inflict more lasting damage on the US’s standing than the 2003 Iraq invasion.“China wasn’t in the wings in 2003,” she said. “It wasn’t ready to take over that global role. Well, it’s now in a position where it can take over global leadership, and it’s just waiting for the US to misstep or to lose support among its allies … And the past couple of years have really been beneficial to China from that perspective.”From the debacle over testing to Trump’s months-long denial about the scale of the threat and his constant political point-scoring, the US has showed itself to be anything but a model for the rest of the world to emulate.Stephen Walt, a Harvard University professor of international relations, has argued that worldwide faith in US competence has been one of the pillars of its global standing, and is currently crumbling.“Far from making ‘America great again,’ this epic policy failure will further tarnish the United States’ reputation as a country that knows how to do things effectively,” Walt wrote in Foreign Policy, in a commentary titled “the death of American competence”.Not all global analysts look at the coronavirus as being so irreversibly negative for US standing in the world, pointing to more long-term trends, like US self-sufficiency in energy and its enduring economic, military and democratic advantages, as well China’s many shortcomings as a credible alternative global leader.“Geopolitics are not episodic. You cannot talk about geopolitics in two-week timescales,” Parag Khanna, a former adviser to US forces who now runs a Singapore-based consulting company, FutureMap. “The power dynamics are what are fundamental, not whether or not China is sending lots of face masks to Africa.”Khanna pointed out that China’s neighbours in Asia are well aware that Beijing’s censorship during the initial outbreak in Wuhan resulted in a missed opportunity to contain the virus, and that its diplomats have been spreading conspiracy theories about the origins of the disease.“China is filling a public goods vacuum, not a leadership vacuum,” Khanna said. “People here are not idiots. They know exactly where this came from, so you don’t need to worry about China winning any global narrative campaign in the world.”Tocci argued that the extent to which China succeeds in exploiting the crisis to pursue global primacy would be dependent on whether Beijing can be successfully challenged, for example from a change to a more outward leadership in Washington, or a Europe that can transcend its isions.“It basically depends on how everyone else reacts more than how China itself acts,” Tocci said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213929.1585320294!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"benign impact of covid 19 on air quality and carbon emissions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Satellites offer a unique vantage point to monitor the health of our planet.’ File photograph: GettyThe world is in a dark place, gripped by a pandemic that could rage for months and take countless lives. But it has led to an astonishing fall in air pollution in the most heavily populated parts of the planet. European Space Agency (ESA) satellites offer remarkable, colour-coded animations to illustrate the change: carbon emissions have declined sharply as lives are put on hold, industry is scaled down, streets quieten, aircraft grounded.Over the past six weeks, readings from the agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite show nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower compared to 2019, resulting in less air pollution. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service has found a significant drop in nitrous oxides and fine particulate matter (PM), the air pollutant produced by traffic (especially diesel vehicles) and the burning of wood, peat and coal. With satellite observations and computer models of the atmosphere, researchers have found a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in surface PM over huge swathes of China. “Satellites offer a unique vantage point to monitor the health of our planet. Sentinel-5P is one of seven Copernicus satellites in orbit today. It currently provides the most accurate measurements of NO2 and other trace gases from space,” explains Josef Aschbacher, ESA’s director of Earth observation. “As NO2 is primarily produced by traffic and factories, it is a first-level indicator of industrial activity worldwide. What is clearly visible is a significant reduction of NO2 levels over China, caused by reduced activity due to Covid-19 restrictions.”Slowdown took out the equivalent of almost 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 in China and could curb global emissions from air travel by 11 to 19 per cent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. As Ireland is not heavily industrialised, effects here are less pronounced but discernible with restrictions ratcheted up in the past fortnight.Greenhouse gas emissions are audited on a yearly basis by the Environmental Protection Agency, whereas air pollutants are monitored on a real-time basis. The March bulletin will show a downward curve but up to February it was very much business as usual with 18 exceedances of European Union NO2 limits, mainly in Dublin.The 2009 crash coincided with the only significant drop in our carbon emissions in the past 20 years. At present, we are among the worst emitters on a per capita basis due to transport, agriculture and poorly-heated buildings reliant on fossil fuels, while increased urbanisation has resulted in often dangerous levels of air pollution.With recent declines, some pollution emissions such as those associated with traffic are likely to be reduced and therefore will reduce air pollution damage to one’s respiratory system, according to Prof Colin O’Dowd of NUIG Centre for Climate and Air Pollution studies. These emissions, however, “are likely to have already caused damage previously, perhaps weakening one’s defence”. His colleague Dr Clare Noone notes air pollution is estimated to be responsible for eight million deaths per year and fossil fuels are largely to blame. “If you live in an area with poor air quality you’re already vulnerable to many health effects, and the associated lung damage from air pollution may worsen those infected with Covid-19.”Once the pandemic has passed, she hopes valuable lessons will be learned about the importance of the air we breathe and our health. “Putting our health and the health of the planet first will mean moving away from fossil fuels . . . to clean renewable energy. More than ever, the time to act on climate and the time to act on health is now.”Coronavirus-prompted trends show what collective action could do in rapidly countering global heating caused by human activity and is already prompting the big question: to what extent recovery will be infused by green actions? Climatologist Prof John Sweeney of Maynooth University says the circumstances are “not the way we would like to tackle climate change” – it is likely to buy some time but prove to be a temporary respite.That said, there is a possibility of change for the better in adopting a more sustainable way of living. In bailing out industries, especially carbon-polluting ones, governments should be conscious there are other ways of doing it, he believes, citing former US president Barack Obama’s rescuing of the US auto industry after the 2009 crash – on condition that vehicles were made more fuel efficient.Warmer winters, longer flu season?This approach should be applied to the aviation and shipping sectors if vast amounts of taxpayer funds are going to be channelled to their benefit, believes Prof Sweeney. Otherwise it would be back to business as usual. However, it is already clear the pandemic will prompt behavioural change. There was likely to be a fall in business travel. “We are seeing that people commute more readily by mouse rather than by car or train,” he says. “Reduced emissions buy the planet a little time but not more than a few years,” he says.Eminent climate scientist Prof Katharine Hayhoe says she is being constantly asked what Covid-19 has to do with climate change? Her response: “The short answer is very little, but the long answer is everything is relative.” The death toll already caused by climate disruption will be seen to outstrip the worst World Health Organisation predictions for coronavirus, she predicts.Coronavirus is being spread by humans, while climate disruption is not significantly affecting spread. “That one’s on us. It goes where we go.”With predictions of warmer winters, a likely consequence is earlier and more severe flu seasons, she said in a Twitter exchange. As the planet warms the flu season could end up being year round and this would give it more time to mutate into more dangerous strains. All of which is just another indication that climate change is “a threat multiplier”. Meanwhile, the other side of the coin is “what will this terrible pandemic do to our emissions?”It is already slashing fossil-fuel use and corresponding carbon and air pollution emissions in China, Italy and beyond. “I think it’s too early to say whether we will see a net long-term decrease in carbon emissions from this alone. Industrial production is likely to ramp back up after the crisis passes. But I do hope it will show us there is a different way to live,” adds Prof Hayhoe.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockThe first Aer Lingus flight to China to collect the first batch of personal protective equipment for the Irish health service is on its return journey and is due to arrive in Dublin this afternoon. The flight arrived in Beijing shortly after 8pm on Sunday, having left Dublin Airport on Saturday morning and is due at Dublin airport at about 3.30pm.On Saturday Minister for Health Simon Harris said the first of upwards of 10 flights carrying PPE, including surgical masks, gowns and eye shields for health service workers, would arrive into Dublin on an Aer Lingus flight from China on Sunday afternoon.Over €225 million had been spent on PPE - compared with €15 million in a normal year, he said. The HSE would begin distributing about €20 million worth of PPE from Sunday evening and up to 10 further flights delivering more equipment were due between now and Wednesday, he said. It comes as stocks of personal protective equipment for healthcare staff tackling the Covid-19 outbreak are “beginning to run low”, according to the Health Service Executive. The HSE is currently seeking to redistribute stocks to sites with “particular shortages”, it said in a statement. “We are encouraging staff to use these resources appropriately at this stage of the crisis.”One group of doctors say they have procured €6,000 worth of PPE themselves after losing patience with the HSE’s efforts to supply the equipment.While the large shipment PPE is scheduled to arrive back in Dublin Airport on Sunday and be distributed in the succeeding days, but it remains unclear whether existing supplies will be sufficient to bridge the gap until then.This €28 million delivery is the first batch of a large contract which the HSE says will address any current shortages.The Chinese embassy in Ireland said on Friday the first Aer Lingus cargo flight carrying PPE was scheduled to leave Dublin on Saturday morning and was due to land back in Dublin Airport late on Sunday.“Sail safe! We have got your back,” the embassy tweeted. It had earlier said it has secured landing slots for the first 10 Aer Lingus flights needed to ferry the equipment back to Ireland.Sources say Defence Forces trucks will be used to distribute the consignment, starting on Sunday evening.The HSE in its statement said it was seeking to manage prudently current PPE supplies “in light of the global shortage of this essential equipment at a time of unprecedented demand”.Since February 1st, about €30 million had been invested in PPE stock, “which are now beginning to run low”. The HSE has been urging hospitals to “preserve” stock until new deliveries arrive. The health service is short of goggles but not of other equipment such as masks, according to HSE chief operating officer Dr Colm Henry. Dr Henry has told staff, in a memo seen by The , to conserve stock by reducing their risk to exposure, not using PPE when they can avoid exposure, substituting some items for others, extending the use of equipment and “reprocessed” PPE.Last week, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association wrote to the Minister for Health warning stocks of PPE were running out in some locations,“leaving frontline staff and their patients in extremely exposed positions”.Over €60 million has been spent so far this year on protective equipment in the fight against Covid-19, compared to a traditional yearly allocation of €15 million.On Thursday, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said he “fully appreciated” the concerns expressed about PPE supplies. He said he too was concerned about the issue, but “it’s a global battle for this”.The total spend on equipment this year will be over €230 million, he added.Earlier this week, a donation of equipment from Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, including masks, testing kits and protective suits, arrived in Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Special sitting of Anglesea Street District Court to take place at 12.30pmAer Lingus plane is first of 10 due to bring equipment back for State\u0026rsquos health serviceRestrictions on movement after after 15th death and another 49 positive tests recordedNiall Murphy in hospital since last weekBishop announces bodies of the dead will be taken directly to the burial groundNorth introduces sweeping powers Local authorities to lead supports for people cocooningFurther 14 people die in Republic while 294 more cases reported bringing total to 2,415Motorcyclists travel across country to collect gloves and masks for St James\u0026rsquos HospitalFarmers, transport workers, journalists among those exempt from some travel restrictionsLocal authority to lead community support service for people cocooningShane Ross says people \u0026lsquoneed not worry\u0026rsquo but focus on abiding by coronavirus measures\u0026lsquoIs there anything to be said for setting the clocks forward to 2021,\u0026rsquo asks Colm TobinDrew Harris: \u0026lsquoWe will stop iniduals and be making sure their journey is essential\u0026rsquoEmergency call-out or delivery services allowed in certain restricted circumstancesOn a sunny Thursday in Salthill\u0026rsquos near-empty promenade, the mood is quiet and terseIf both parties agree, orders on visitation and maintenance can be alteredSupplier cites recent Italian law that domestic need take precedence over exportsGarda\u0026iacute, medics and Minister for Transport concerned at increase in road deathsSector to seek financial support as nine clusters of Covid-19 found in nursing homesTaoiseach introduces sweeping new measures on social and commercial activityStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213881.1585316147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus galwegians adjust to a new traffic free reality","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Herron at Blackrock in Salthill, Galway. ‘You do feel the general anxiety. Personally, I feel I am dealing with it okay.’ Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyFor years, city planners fretted over how to solve Galway’s absurd traffic problem, one which sees\u0026nbspcars and trucks grinding slowly through narrow streets, before heading out to Salthill.Nobody thought of a pandemic. On Thursday, a day gorgeous and mild, no breeze and the sea green and glassy, the traffic that was about in Salthill skated freely on near-empty roads.The mood by the seaside is strange: just that little bit too quiet and terse and everyone careful in how they move. The promenade has always been a four-seasons refuge for locals: a gulp of salt air, a quick swim for the hardy.Michael Herron is one of those, not long out of the water. He sits sipping coffee and chatting to another Blackrock regular, who says the water is about seven degrees. They are on a stone-cut seat, several metres apart.“You do feel the general anxiety,” Herron says. “Personally, I feel I am dealing with it okay. For a lot of people who haven’t had those challenges, it can be tricky to know what you are feeling is anxiety.”He works as a physiotherapist. He stopped taking bookings the week before St Patrick’s Day, and closed up that week. He then called his landlord.“I told him what I needed, which was the rent suspended. And he agreed.”So far, the days have been okay. Last year, he attended a 10-day silent retreat.“I think that has stood me in good stead for all of this,” he laughs. Nearby, two women chat as they walk in tandem, two metres apart. They prefer not to give their names but stop to talk. “This is the scariest thing I have experienced,” one says.“Both of us are isolating. Keeping away from friends, family, supermarkets. Having our groceries delivered. As a precaution. If we go out, we are keeping the physical distance of six feet.“We are happy with the way the Government is doing it. We think they are on it. They put in the precautions early on,” she goes on, adding that she sees her grandchildren when they come to visit and play in the garden.Alien and counterintuitiveBut that’s it. She doesn’t go anywhere near them. It’s alien and counterintuitive, but absolutely vital. On their walks, they have noticed awareness increasing by the day.People are staying away from each other, being strict about distance. The prom is a kind of self-contained community. Regulars know one another from years of tramping up and down.“But this is stressful. Definitely, it is always on my mind.”On Shop Street, the pubs are closed and the narrow street empty of its usual flaneurs and party animals. The atmosphere is weird and disconcerting, as though the eternal weekend has finally quit. Honza Kucera is busking anyway. It’s what he does. He has stationed himself in his usual spot near Murphy’s, his guitar case open. There’s too much velvet and not enough coin on show.He’s originally from the Czech Republic. “The borders are closed but I reckon I could probably go back – if I had anywhere to go back to,” he says brightly.Down the street, a lonely piper plays, the only other music on the street.“It could be worse,” Kucera says. “There has been solidarity, you know. In the winter you hardly see anyone dropping coins because their hands are cold and everything. Now you see fewer people. But there are not so many buskers on the street. There is less competition and most people that you do see out, it is necessary for them to be out. But they are good.”He’s living in a tent at the moment. He came back to the city last year, but could not get enough money for a deposit. When the rains and storms are severe, he uses hostels. But they have shut since the virus.“The weather’s not so bad recently, anyway.” So he figures he might get out of the city for a while. “Go up the country. Roam the woods.” But for now, he might as well play music for the crowd not here. He checks the news bulletins “to see what else I shouldn’t be doing”. And he moves from busking straight back to his tent, resisting the temptation to call in on friends. “I am keeping the distance,” he shrugs. “Everyone is doing the same. I am not really scared, though. Some people say it is irresponsible to stay out and to be on the street and to play music. But I don’t feel that way, to be honest.”School bellsOn normal Thursdays, the heavy-duty gridlock on the fabled N17 would start just after the school bells rang across the city. Claregalway is one of those towns that featured prominently on the daily radio traffic reports, in the blissful yesterday when traffic was a huge problem. The town is ghostly quiet today. Jackie and Peadar Dolan are outside their cafe, Treat. They locked the doors almost two weeks ago but still call in to check the freezers and run an eye over things.“Just keeping a business alive is a cost,” Peadar says. Treat is a local success story: a small, friendly, informal breakfast and dinner cafe opened on the cusp of the recession and slowly expanded to a second cafe in Lackagh village and a catering business. The company employs 60 people, and the Dolans could read the warning signs in the faces of their customers and their staff well before the Government issued instructions to close.“It has been like a rollercoaster,” Jackie says.“We saw something coming and could feel it coming. People weren’t coming out. And then there was a sudden stop. And then my staff were becoming more fearful. And you took the decision that there wasn’t enough business to stay open and that you were putting yourself and the staff at risk.”They locked their doors on the Sunday before St Patrick’s Day. “Over this past two weeks, you couldn’t reflect because you were all over the place,” Peadar admits. “Your head is in a pure fog. It is only now we are starting to do that.”They are deeply saddened by this and know they did the right thing.“Getting it ourselves,” Peadar replies instantly when asked about his deepest fear in this whole crisis. They have read and heard enough to respect and fear it. So they will wait it out. The business has already survived several major hurdles.Destroyed by fireThree years in, the cafe was destroyed by a fire.“The local community really kicked in and helped us. We were in the midst of the recession and I think we worked for nothing for four years.”Then the new motorway opened and instantly caused a 30 per cent drop in passing trade. The new VAT rates hit them. “And we have floods in Claregalway too. So fire, floods . . . famine is the only thing we haven’t had. And we pretty much have that at the minute. We survived all of those things because of the local people coming in. And that is what we miss. We miss the chat here and people coming in.”Already, people have been asking Peadar about setting up the catering truck for takeaway coffees. He knows he could operate it within the rules, but is not sure that a demand exists.There is, however, a need for something communal, some sense of gathering. “But would it be the right thing?” Jackie asks. Doing the right thing has become paramount.Back in Salthill the swimmers come and go all afternoon. There’s plenty of space and the rocks and ing boards have never offered such a vital sense of escape.“It will be interesting to see what happens when there is a bit of weather,” Michael Herron says. He and his friend cross their fingers, hoping that the promenade will stay open during the crisis.Turning to his companion, he wonders about life after Covid-19. Will people be more wary?

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government has published a list of workers who provide an “essential service” and can therefore continue to go to work despite restrictions introduced on Friday night.Among the list of professions included are farmers, farm labourers, manufacturers of food and beverage products and construction workers involved in “essential health and related projects” relevant to the coronavirus crisis.It also includes transport workers, news publishers, hotels or essential accommodation providers, banking and financial service workers, healthcare, social care, community and voluntary workers and certain retail workers.However construction workers have been restricted to those involved in “essential health and related projects” relevant to the pandemic.The document, which was published on Saturday evening, lists specific examples of workers within the following industries:People have been told to stay at home in virtually all circumstances and all public and private gatherings have been banned for two weeks as part of the Government’s latest sweeping measures to tackle coronavirus, also known as Covid-19.The only exceptions to the stay-at-home rule is for travel to health, social care or other essential work, shopping for food and takeaways, medical appointments and for “vital family reasons” such as providing care.People will also be allowed take “brief, inidual” physical exercise within 2km of their home.The document says if you are not engaged in the provision of essential services, then “you are not permitted to travel to and from work until April 12th, 2020”.There will be a grace period until 6pm on Monday, March 30th, for people “who need to make necessary arrangements to wind down their activities in an orderly way”.“This should however be done in a way that minimises travel and personal interaction as much as possible,” the guidance document states.It says in “exceptional circumstances” it is accepted that some extra time will be needed for a wind down of activity or it may be necessary for a site to continue to operate “at a reduced level of activity” (eg in complex manufacturing processes or very large construction projects).“This guidance will be kept under ongoing review, and will be updated as required,” it adds.Employers have been told that they should refer to the guidance document to decide whether their organisation is providing an essential service but that it is not necessary to seek official authorisation.Workers should carry work identification or a letter from their employer indicating they are “an essential employee” as well as one other form of identification.The self-employed, farmers or agricultural workers and members of the clergy have been told to carry one form of identification with them at all times.The document says all organisations that provide essential services should have “business continuity and resilience plans” in place.“This should take account of the possibility that key workers or key facilities may be impacted by Covid-19.”In response to the publication, Danny McCoy, chief executive of employers’ group Ibec, said: “For essential business that continue to operate in this crisis, we support the workforce who are at the front line. For the shops and utilities, there is a wide array of businesses and factories essential to their supply chains. Their work, courage and service must be commended in these difficult circumstances.“It takes a varied, erse and complex set of businesses to ensure the essential running of public service as well as the provision of goods and services to households. Today’s list published by Government is reflective of this.”Administrative and support servicesWhere necessary to support other essential services:Public administration and defencePublic administration activities necessary to support essential services and provision of social protection benefits (including Civil Service and Local Government):Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214970.1585421687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"driving and nct tests suspended as minister looks to extend validity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShane Ross and the Road Safety Authority RSA) confirmed on Saturday that the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), the National Car Testing Service (NCT), as well as the Commercial Vehicle Testing System are suspended until further notice.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4215001.1585471562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus world s oldest man marks 112th birthday in isolation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBob Weighton shares his birthday with Britain’s oldest woman, Joan Hocquard. Photograph: Magnus WeightonPA WireThe man believed to be the world’s oldest man has said celebrations for his 112th birthday are a “dead loss” after they had to be cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak.Bob Weighton, from Alton, Hampshire in Britain, took up the title of the oldest man in the world last month after the death of the previous holder, Chitetsu Watanabe of Japan, and marks his birthday today.Last year, the former teacher and engineer celebrated with his many friends at his retirement flat but this year the supercentenarian — the term for someone aged 110 and older — is under restrictions like the rest of Britain, Ireland and other countries.“Everything is cancelled, no visitors, no celebration. It’s a dead loss as far as celebration is concerned,” he told the PA news agency.Mr Weighton lived through the Spanish flu pandemic which swept around the world in 1918, when he was 10 years old, killing between 50 and 100 million people.He said: “I only read about it in history books when I got older.“Actually I wasn’t aware there was a Spanish flu around because none of my brothers and sisters, or people I knew, were affected.“I am sure they were, but a child’s world is not an adult’s world, a child doesn’t read the newspapers and there was no radio in those days so you didn’t get news in the sense you get it thrown at you in all directions nowadays.”Mr Weighton said that now the “world is in a bit of a mess” with coronavirus and it worries him because “nobody knows what is going to happen”.He added that, unlike the two World Wars he lived through, the challenge of Covid-19 was the unknown elements of battling the virus.“In the Second World War you knew what you had to do, you might fail but the objectives were clear as Churchill rallied the country behind him, ‘We will fight on the beaches’, et cetera et cetera,” he said.“We knew exactly what we had to do. That was an objective that you could possibly reach, but nobody knows how we are going to defeat the virus.”He said the impact on him of self-isolation was that he had become more dependent on the care home where he lives, particularly for meals and from the assistant who helps him clean and lift heavier objects.“It means that I have to be more self-sufficient, do my own cooking, cleaning, read the books that I haven’t read.“I am less capable of doing things for myself than I was 10 years ago — I can’t lift the weights, I can’t move as fast, I can’t even dress myself properly.“I depend very much on other people these days.”Mr Weighton said he had no secret to his longevity, adding: “I never intended to be this old. When you are young, you don’t think about what is going to happen when you’re old, you’re self-engaged, all you think about is the here and now.”But he did say that his wide general interests from reading to constructing model windmills keep him active and young.“Those are things you do either naturally or don’t do. People who complain are those who don’t explore things that they might do themselves,” he said.Mr Weighton added that he has turned down the traditional birthday greeting from Queen Elizabeth.“I won’t be getting one because I don’t want one,” he said.“I had about 10 and I don’t see why I should require the Queen to keep giving me cards. It costs the taxpayer, not her, something, so I have selected one in which she is smiling, looking happy and contented and that’s the one I like and I keep that.”Mr Weighton was born in Hull on March 29th, 1908, which, by coincidence, is the same day as Britain’s oldest woman, Joan Hocquard, from Poole, Dorset, and also the birthday of Alf Smith, from St Madoes in Perthshire, Scotland, who shared the title of Britain’s oldest man until his death last year.Mr Weighton said: “I don’t know Joan but I would like to send her my best wishes for her birthday.”The father-of-three — one of seven himself — has 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. - PAStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson warns stricter lockdown could be imposedBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullHow can I join the NHS coronavirus volunteer army, and what would I do?How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

The problem was that, earlier in the day, he had suggested there might be as many as 600,000. Asked to account for the difference, he said his earlier answer had taken into account asymptomatic cases. So what is it? 54,000 or 600,000?Italy is not alone. Earlier this week, the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo published a report into the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in February with more than 800 of the 3,711 people on board eventually diagnosed with Covid-19. According to the report, cited by the Japan Times, four-fifths of those infected showed no symptoms or just mild symptoms. Scans showed their lungs had suffered some physical consequences from the virus, but the patients had not been led by their symptoms to believe they were infected. Quite the reverse.Even in China, the poster child for lockdown and trace tactics which is edging back towards business as usual, there is uncertainty about asymptomatic cases. Estimates are classified. Officials insist all asymptomatic cases are unearthed by so-called contact tracing, yet even if this is true and every such case is detected, the numbers are not trivial: the South China Morning Post obtained details which suggested some 40,000 asymptomatic cases had been discovered in this way. It\u0027s hard not to believe there are many more. One way or another, it is clear that far more of us have, or have had, Covid-19, than the official figures tell us. But how many more? Only mass testing will give us a real picture of what is happening, and thus needs to happen at a far greater rate in the UK than is currently the case:Without mass testing, two very different pictures of the spread of the virus are emerging. On the one hand, there is the optimistic scenario, suggested by an Oxford paper which on Wednesday gained a huge amount of attention for a model suggesting that, given the current state of the UK outbreak, some 68 per cent of the population would have been infected by 19032020 – some 45 million of us, by last week, most presumably without even knowing it.Such a result would be dramatic. The outbreak is overblown, it would confirm. Most of us have already had the disease and are now fine. The NHS has survived the epidemic without even knowing it. But that was just one paper. There is another scenario. This one is that yes, there are lots of asymptomatic carriers (though far from 45 million), but rather than being beacons of hope and joy, they represent hidden problems – mines sown among the rest of us, ready to explode and cause a new outbreak just when it appears we might be on top of this one. According to researchers at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (in a paper awaiting peer review), children may represent such mines because only around 20 per cent of them develop clinical symptoms (as opposed to 70 per cent in older adults). Yet it is not yet clear how infectious such largely asymptomatic people are. This critical question must be resolved to effectively forecast and control Covid-19 epidemics, the authors note.Such infection is certainly possible. In Wuhan on Tuesday, the one new case was that of a doctor reportedly infected by an asymptomatic patient. And on the Diamond Princess, studies suggest some of the 20 per cent of infected passengers who  suffered serious symptoms either went several days without obvious outward signs of the condition or caught it from those who never went on to develop serious symptoms.So is the epidemic mostly over or every bit as bad as we think, with the potential to erupt when we imagine we\u0027re through the worst? A single truth emerges: we will only discover the genuine picture through mass blood testing – a simple finger-prick tests that works like this:The testing must be followed, once the outbreak (whatever its true size) is controlled, by picking representative samples in the population to screen regularly, just as such samples are quizzed by pollsters to get a more or less accurate snapshot of national voting intention.In the middle of a mass global outbreak, it seems impossible to carry out whole population testing. Yet fate has twice thrown up unusual circumstances in which this has happened. The Diamond Princess was one such. The other was the 3,000-strong town of Vo, in Italy, where the entire population was tested after one of its citizens became the first to die of the disease.There, too, researchers found a significant proportion of the population (three per cent) had been infected without knowing it, representing the vast bulk of the 89 cases discovered. More generally, in the researchers\u0027 estimation, asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70 per cent of all virus-infected people.There is good news in this: mass testing in Vo meant there were no further deaths. And factoring in asymptomatic cases also dramatically lowers the disease\u0027s mortality rate, which is currently based only on those who receive tests – usually those showing obvious or severe symptoms. And finally, if you had a fever or a hacking cough earlier in the year and, looking back, now swear you must have had Covid-19 – well, you might just be right.

Indeed, it appears to have acted far quicker to this outbreak than to its own – had that been the other way round, Europe\u0027s outbreak might not be so catastrophic. Yet despite the offers of help, gratefully received in some quarters, others have been far more sceptical about Beijing\u0027s motives. Many suspect they amount to a form of whitewashing – an effort to distract from initial failings and shift the focus away from who bears responsibility for the rampage of the virus through continents.Across Europe, hearts are hardening to China\u0027s offers, and their efforts to change the narrative may be about to backfire spectacularly.A crime against humanity is how the Italian opposition politician Matteo Salvini described China\u0027s response to the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, in a statement that will have struck a nerve in the country that has been worst affected.Salvini has form in criticism of Beijing, having spoken out often about what he called the colonisation of Italy as the Five Star Movement, his former coalition government partners, cosied up to China as part of a €2.5 billion deal under the Belt and Road Initiative.He has been critical of Chinese businesses investing in Italy, buying up factories once staffed by Italians and importing Chinese migrant workers in order to exploit the prestige of the Made in Italy label on goods such as textiles while keeping costs down. He has also been outspoken on the need for Italians\u0027 data, from banking information to mobile phones, to be kept in Italian hands, warning against allowing companies such as Huawei into the country and echoing the views of the US President, Donald Trump.Now, amid this outbreak, Salvini is using language sure to grip a public that has been slowly turning to the political right for years amid falling employment and a corrupt, failing bureaucratic system.China, of course, has been damned by much of the West for the way it treats its citizens, from human rights outrages in Xinjiang against the Uigher community to its new system of social credit. And that is before mentioning Tibet.Members of the Uighur community and sympathisers demonstrate against the Chinese government in Amsterdam in DecemberHuman rights is a phrase never far from the lips of those who criticise China. Now – amid an outbreak which many blame Beijing for not dealing with adequately at best, and facilitating through dishonesty at worst – the nightmare picture Salvini is painting for the Italian public is clear: China\u0027s crimes are not limited to its own people but will be visited upon you, too.Trump has for a long time demonised China, but the view that the world\u0027s second-largest economy is the danger he has depicted has yet to take hold of Europe in the way that fear of Russia, say, or Islamist extremism, has. That could be about to change.Salvini was already popular in Italy – at around 30 per cent, his party, the Lega, is more than twice as popular as the Five Star. Another party, the far-right Fratelli d\u0027Italia, has been steadily rising in the polls since well before the outbreak of Covi-19, and this is a further example of the direction in which the country is heading.One suspects that, when this dreadful episode is finally over, the Lega and the FdI will be the big winners politically from going after China and accusing it of being the party responsible  for the deaths of tens of thousands of Italians.Matteo Salvini after a meeting with Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, at the Chigi Palace It will also, one thinks, be crippling for Five Star after its close history with Beijing, but also for other left-wing parties, who for decades have preached globalism as the answer to ailing Italy\u0027s problems. It will be extremely difficult to continue to make that argument to a nation as badly stung as this, no matter how good it may be.But what must also be on the table now is how other countries will respond. Anti-Chinese sentiment has existed in Italy for a long time, for a number of reasons unique to the peninsula. But how will Spain, for example, with its equally horrific toll, or France, edging ever close to the Front National, respond?Despite China\u0027s rush to provide EU countries with aid, reports have already emerged from both Spain and the Czech Republic that the hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests Beijing has delivered are not fit for purpose. That will do little to help China\u0027s already battered image. Europe\u0027s relationship with China was already set to be the major talking point, beside Brexit, for the next few years. If the likes of Salvini get their way, coronavirus may be the thing that tips the continent from scepticism to outright hostility.Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson warns stricter lockdown could be imposedBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullHow can I join the NHS coronavirus volunteer army, and what would I do?How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

No amount of gratitude is too much for those who are in the front line of caring for us all, working long and anti-social hours and having to make life and death choices. It was a wonderful demonstration of the whole community coming together in difficult times. But let us also give a metaphorical clap too to all those businesses and the self-employed who, while complying with the requisite two metre rule, have stayed open to keep the lights of the economy on and to maintain vital aspects of life for the fortunate 99 per cent of households who are not expected to end up hospitalised by this new virus.In an age where as many as two thirds of people do not know the name of their neighbour, we forget at our peril that the window cleaner or the gardener who visits weekly to cut the grass are often serving as invisible social workers, the first to notice when they don’t get the usual cheery wave. And just as for the whole economy, the NHS “chain” is only as strong as its weakest link – whether that is the security guard on reception, the catering company serving its canteen, the van driver delivering supplies or the electricity company providing energy.Indeed, in an era of complex, interconnected supply chains, the roles of warehouse staff, the postmen and women, farmers, garage mechanics, take-away owners, telecoms engineers, bank loan processors and all those working in supermarkets, factories and food processing companies are equally vital.Far from such firms being shamed for remaining open as some on the Left have chosen to advocate, they too deserve our thanks and applause for their work helping during this national emergency.Some large firms may have already over-reacted and actually undermined the national effort at this time. The drive-through McDonald’s in my constituency was one of few such facilities in rural West Sussex, full of blue-light workers day and night who were grateful for a freshly made coffee, a clean WC and a hot bite to eat on the way to or from their shift.Where are all those essential workers supposed to go now? The economy – not to mention our children’s generation – will thank business leaders for not over-reacting. Export markets founded on historical ties and trading patterns once lost may never return again. Those Asian economies that never shut down to the extent that we already have are awakening and more than happy to plug the gaps left when the phone at a UK supplier sits ringing unanswered.The unprecedented measures – and level of expenditure – that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, has now put in place are the most comprehensive anywhere in the world. With this sort of support, business and the self-employed now have greater certainty and a valuable safety net. In return, let’s maintain cool heads and keep the economy open for business.Andrew Griffith is the former Chief Operating Officer \u0026amp CFO of Sky, was the Prime Minister’s Chief Business Adviser until December 2019 and is Conservative MP for Arundel \u0026amp South DownsCoronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson warns stricter lockdown could be imposedBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullHow can I join the NHS coronavirus volunteer army, and what would I do?How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

We are told the peak will be in about three weeks. But we are also told that until we have a vaccine, thought to be over a year away, the virus will come back in wave after wave. Normal life seems a long way off. But normal life is much closer in countries that have embraced the advice of World Health Organisation Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom to “test test test”.The restaurants are open in South Korea. You can go shopping in Taiwan. Offices are open in Singapore. These countries learned the hard way how to deal with a pandemic after the deadly SARS virus. They now show us how we can emerge from lockdown.Testing provides clarity. Where you find it, you can isolate and contain it. And where you don’t, vital services continue to function. In most of those countries restaurants, malls and office blocks require you to walk through a temperature checker before you enter. They all check international visitors the same way and are astonished we don’t do the same at Heathrow.The immediate priority is to protect the NHS and ramp up its capacity. Beds, equipment, and ventilators  are all vital, but as every health secretary learns fairly quickly, the true capacity of the NHS lies in its staff.They are the heroes we need to protect – and make sure they can get back to work as quickly as possible if a member of their household has symptoms. Around 10 per cent of the population have a cough or fever at this time of year, taking thousands of NHS workers off the frontline. The government’s commitment to accelerate testing for NHS staff is therefore absolutely right.But as new tests come on stream we need to go further. Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, told the Select Committee which I chair on Thursday that the virus can incubate for three to five days before any symptoms. Those are days when doctors and nurses could be infecting their own patients. We need weekly tests for all NHS and care home staff to remove that worry.As we tool up to do this, you begin to see how mass testing can also show us the way out of this crisis. Social distancing works because it drastically reduces the opportunity for transmission. What was previously an exponential growth in transmission becomes much slower as the curve is flattened. But this only works for as long as it’s in place, and it can’t remain in place forever. But with mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission.Of course, with many other countries thinking the same way, there is no magic wand that will suddenly overcome shortages in testing supply chains. The solution is to look to British scientists and manufacturers to put in place tests and the infrastructure we need to process them. Just as we are rising to the challenge with ventilators, we need urgently to do the same for testing.If we do so, the opportunities are clear. South Korea has tested five times more people per head of population than us – and are reaping the rewards with their new cases now on a downward trend – despite being nearer to China. They are reporting fewer than ten deaths every day.Closer to home, Germany is leading the way. Two weeks ago they had carried out 167,000 tests, four times more than us. As a result they have identified three times more cases than us – but with fewer than half the number of deaths we have had. There may be differences in reporting, but fundamentally, finding Covid-19 patients earlier means you can get the most vulnerable ones hospital care more quickly. In Germany they are even taking in patients from France and Italy.We should be under no illusion that the contact tracing that goes alongside testing is resource intensive. Every time somebody tests positive, they need a dedicated contact tracer who works through all their previous interactions to make sure every single one is isolated until they are tested as Covid-free. Why not allocate all the local government officials in planning departments and the civil servants on non-Covid duties to this task?And as Europe’s tech hub, we should use our skills there, too. In Singapore everyone has been asked to use the TraceTogether App. When you come near someone else with the app it swaps anonymous ID data which is stored in your phone. If you contract the virus, everyone you have been near can be contacted.Singapore has had just two deaths. It is encrypted and all data destroyed after 21 days. Those worried about the civil liberties implications might reflect that Singaporeans have had their liberties curtailed far less than countries which have had to go into full lockdown.Mass social distancing should protect the NHS through the peak over the next few weeks, but it’s a blunt instrument with massive economic impact. For the next wave we must use the precision scalpel of mass testing.Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson warns stricter lockdown could be imposedBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullHow can I join the NHS coronavirus volunteer army, and what would I do?How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

The direct cost of Britain’s stimulus package is £70 billion which, as Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, confirmed on Friday, is considerably higher than in other countries.The indirect costs are harder to assess, but will surely be gargantuan. The first nine days of the crisis pushed half a million more people onto the dole, wiping out five years of rising employment. With every day that our shops remain shut, the benefits bill will rise – just as tax revenues dry up.I don’t think we yet understand how vast a hit we are taking. It has become commonplace to compare the coronavirus to the Second World War, but our domestic economy continued to function even at the height of the Blitz. Shops, pubs and schools stayed open, and cinemas were closed for only two weeks.We also had full employment: in 1943, 76 per cent of working-age people had jobs, a peak not reached again until 2018. Even so, the debts we took on during the war were a drag on our economy for decades. As this column noted last week, the final instalment of our loan from the United States was not repaid until 2006.This time, the damage is more concentrated. Every hour that these closures remain in force is adding months to our eventual recovery. My three-year-old, who is playing obliviously at my feet as I type these words, will be working off the debt for the rest of his life.Vaccine for CoronavirusAt the same time, we are curtailing freedom of contract, of movement, of worship, of assembly, of ownership – restrictions which, three weeks ago, were utterly unthinkable.If the opinion polls are to be believed, 90 per cent of us support the clampdown. It is worth dwelling, for a moment, on that figure. Obviously, we should be prepared to mothball the economy if that is the only way to save hundreds of thousands of lives. But is it? No one really knows.Michael Levitt, a Stanford biophysicist and Nobel Prize winner, correctly forecast the course of the outbreak in China by analysing the acceleration rather than the number of fatalities. Applying the same method, he now thinks that the outbreak is peaking elsewhere.An Oxford University study suggests that the infections began much earlier than is currently supposed, and that many of us – possibly most of us – have already had the bug, either mildly or asymptomatically.Obviously, we can’t yet say whether either of these hypotheses is correct. The number of high-profile people who have experienced only slight symptoms – including the Prime Minster, the Health Secretary and the Prince of Wales – anecdotally supports the notion that the virus is widespread.The authors of the Imperial College report that suggested 250,000 deaths now say that the fatalities will be around 5,700 – less than a year of winter flu. But none of this amounts to proof, and we can hardly blame ministers for erring on the side of caution.Boris Johnson is breaking all records for popularity. Seventy-two per cent of us like the way he is handling things. Small-government types give him the benefit of the doubt. Jeremy Corbyn, they know, would be using the crisis to impose state control for its own sake. Theresa May would be indulging her authoritarian streak. But everyone can see that the Prime Minister imposed these restrictions only as a last resort.When Steve Baker, the most libertarian MP in the Commons, read out some of the emergency powers being granted to the Government, his voice kept cracking but, even Steve conceded, that such powers were needed in the very short term.Among statists, there is no such ambiguity. They were calling for the shutdown long before it was imposed. People who crave the smack of firm Government become more numerous at times like this. Fear changes our brain chemistry. We become warier and less tolerant of dissent. Never mind the police in Derbyshire and their idiotic filming of solitary Peak District walkers. Far nastier, in my book, is the website established by Humberside cops inviting people to snitch on neighbours who venture outside too often. Yet, instead of chiding our chief constables for their pettiness, our tabloids are demanding greater police powers – as well as rationing and price controls.Social Distancing - Why it is CrucialMinisters understand that they will be judged by the number of coronavirus fatalities – even if reducing that number pushes up the mortality rate elsewhere. Longevity correlates with wealth and, as resources are misallocated, there will be more needless deaths. One study suggests that, if the economy shrinks by more than 6.4 per cent, Britain will suffer more fatalities than are caused by the virus itself.But no one will blame the Government for unidentifiable losses. It is a version of what the nineteenth-century economist Frédéric Bastiat called “the seen and the unseen”. And so, whatever the rights and wrongs of the lockdown, there will be pressure to keep it in place for longer than is justified by the science.“You can’t be too careful,” we will be told. “Let’s leave things as they are until we are absolutely sure. After all, lives are worth more than money.” But this isn’t about lives versus money it’s about lives versus lives.A total shutdown is literally lethal. Loosening the restrictions as soon as possible is not just a question of freedom or of economic growth it is a question of basic welfare.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Yet as in Britain, the traditions face the challenges of a growing proportion of the population cut off from countryside life and a younger generation losing interest.“We are losing a lot of sense of the ethos about what countryside life is about and there\u0027s a lot of misconception here in the cities of countryside culture, of why we have these things and what they contribute,” Mr Alikhan said.Mr Alikhan was already a devotee of Pakistan\u0027s equestrian sports before he studied at Pembroke College, but became attracted to the community around English hunt life while living with his family in rural Oxfordshire.“As a foreign student, seldom do you get the chance to experience the countryside, or the breadth of people, he said. It just got me thinking, because I was involved here with traditional countryside sport and things of that nature.”At the same time, he also became aware of the story of the PVH. During the nineteenth century, British Army officers used to bring packs of foxhounds with them to India, when they used hunting for sport and training. The PVH was founded in what is now northwest Pakistan in 1870, when several regimental and private packs merged. It quickly became the  most famous hunt in India. The hunt kept its ties to Pakistan\u0027s military and continued to thrive after the British left in 1947.“Although it did have its origins in the British period, it was the Pakistani equestrian, polo-playing lot that carried it forward,” said Mr Alikhan.By the 1970s it faded out though, as the pressures of land reform and the strain of the conflict with India proved too much.Deciding to set up a pack of foxhounds in Pakistan under the banner of the PVH, Mr Alikhan went around hunts in England to see if they would donate dogs. Hunts were sceptical at first, but the Duke of Beaufort\u0027s hunt and Berkeley hunt eventually agreed on the condition an English huntsman stayed with the project in its early years to ensure the dogs were well cared for. Seven hounds were shipped to Pakistan in January 2019.Currently minding the hounds and helping set up the pack is Frederick Thackray, a 19-year-old from Hampshire who learnt his hunting trade with beagles at Radley. While his friends are spending gap years on the beaches of Australia or southeast Asia, Mr Thackray is sleeping in a kennel in rural Pakistan.The sight of his pack has been met with curiosity by nearby villagers.“One day we went hunting, it was just the three of us, and we finished the day with about 40 locals following us around. They were just rural people and hunting was in their blood,” he told the  last week.A breeding programme has so far produced three pups and more hounds are set to be imported. The dogs have had to adjust to a much hotter and drier environment, as well as new food and wildlife.“They had no idea about the smells in the beginning at all about what they were doing,” said Mr Alikhan. “We have civets here, we have foxes, jackals, we have porcupines, so that was a challenge.”A famed landowner and champion of traditional Pakistani equestrian sport, Malik Ata Muhammad Khan became the new hunt\u0027s patron. After his death in February, his nephew has taken up the task.Malik Muhammad Arslan said: “During the hunting season these dogs have been a great support while hunting. My uncle was very fond of these hounds in particular.”The ambition is to set up a pack of 20 to 30 hounds and eventually hunt two days a week, said Mr Thackray.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"least 16m people could infected coronavirus uk new estimates","story":"New analysis has shown that 1.6m people in England could already be infected by coronavirus, with more than half of these people living outside the capital.And the figure could already be as high as 2.8m come Sunday, The  has calculated, assuming the infection has a daily growth rate of 20 per cent, as predicted by researchers.The modelling, conducted by Edge Health and shown in the chart below, shows that despite just under 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases being recorded as of Thursday, the actual number of infections in England is likely to be at least 1,614,505.England\u0027s worst-hit region to date is London, where 760,590 Covid cases were estimated - some 47 per cent of the total. But most cases are now outside the capital and spreading rapidly.The Midlands, an emerging hotspot, is thought to be hosting a further 282,954 infections, according to the new study.London is home to England\u0027s 17 worst-impacted local authorities, with Southwark having the highest rate of infection. With one in every six people estimated to have been infected, the borough is at the epicentre of the UK\u0027s fight against coronavirus. The chart below shows the actual, rather than estimated, data.While Southwark had 253 officially recorded cases as of Thursday, the actual number of infected people is estimated to be as high as 49,139.Official test numbers massively underplay the scale of the epidemic because test capacity is limited and only a tiny fraction of those displaying symptoms are being tested.In six other London boroughs more than one in 10 people now carry the virus, according to the modelling: Lambeth, Brent, Kensington and Chelsea, Harrow, Wandsworth and Westminster.Cumbria in the North West and Wolverhampton in the Midlands are the worst-impacted areas outside London, with one in 13 and one in 15 people infected respectively.Birmingham had the highest total number of infections, with a total of 50,004 estimated cases - one in every 23 people.George Batchelor, a co-founder of Edge health, the company which conducted the modelling, warned that the UK epidemic would continue to spread at speed for the next few weeks.The UK lockdown was only introduced five days ago and its impact in slowing the virus will take some time to become evident on the ground. Italy’s lockdown, implemented weeks before our own, is only now just starting to show up in the official data.The Edge Health research team calculated the expected number of cases by looking at the total number of recorded deaths in each region, assuming a mortality rate of 0.7 per cent in London and 0.9 per cent outside the capital where the population is older.The modelling can never be perfect but, based on the best available evidence on death rates, it is likely to give a reasonable indication of the current spread of the virus in England.  It points to the future demand that the NHS is bracing for, with people infected before Boris Johnson imposed a national lockdown expected to start to present in hospital wards across the country over the next few weeks.Edge Health expects critical care bed occupancy to peak over a week in mid-April.Kingston upon Hull, North East Lincolnshire and Hartlepool had the lowest estimated rate of infection, with one in every 619, 304 and 295 people infected respectively as of Thursday. The chart below shows the actual number of cases.While London is the country\u0027s epicentre right now, that will change as the virus moves across the country.The Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Hull and Blackburn with Darwen all had growth rates of 100 per cent or higher last week - meaning that cases doubled between Wednesday and Thursday.Among local authorities to have already seen over 100 cases, Essex saw the highest daily growth rate, at 48 per cent.With areas outside the capital generally having older populations and fewer hospital beds available, there are fears over the NHS\u0027s capacity to deal with a surge in demand should the virus take hold in such areas.Mr Batchelor said the latest modelling proved the need for social distancing and further testing.He said: Critically these projections are based on unproven assumptions, although hopefully, they make clear the need for social distancing whether you are in Southwark or Hartlepool.“More testing would help to understand the actual number of people that have had the infection.

The trouble with the coronavirus is almost exactly the opposite – it is transmitted to the sick by contact with the healthy. The people most at risk of dying are those who already suffer from underlying illnesses. And evidence is accumulating that the virus is passed on very early in the progression of the disease, often when you are still without much in the way of symptoms.The arrival of fast and reliable mass antibody testing, this coming week with luck, should be a game changer. It will enable those who have had the virus and recovered to be identified and licensed to resume normal life. How long their immunity lasts is unknown, but there is a good chance it will be many months at least. Once antibody testing and more widespread virus testing roll out we will find out just how widespread the virus is among those with no or few symptoms. Only then can we know for sure what the case fatality rate is, but the best guess is that it will be well below one per cent overall, though up to 10 per cent in elderly cohorts.Some people show almost no symptoms – and this seems to be especially true of children. “Children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms,” says one Chinese study. Those who do get symptoms report a dry cough, fever, aches, fatigue and often – perhaps even in the absence of other symptoms – a sudden loss of taste and smell. The first few days are often mild, but – in contrast to Sars – this is when you are most infectious. “High transmissibility of Covid-19 near symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic,” concludes one study. By contrast, unlike flu, it seems to be most severe and dangerous in the second week, with people needing hospitalisation somewhere between day nine and day 12 if at all. It is killing almost twice as many men as women, perhaps because men seem to generate fewer of a key antibody type, immunoglobulin G.The virus is very contagious. A person with Covid-19 produces a thousand times as many viruses as somebody with Sars would do. On average he or she gives it to more than two people in the absence of social distancing. But averages mislead. Some super-spreaders give the virus to 50 or more people. It is not clear why: they could be less sick and so more sociable, or just loaded with more virus. One of South Korea’s advantages here is that in 2015 it had an outbreak of the Mers coronavirus and learned a lot about superspreaders and the value of tracing all their contacts.Most infection seems to occur indoors and worryingly quite a lot may have happened within the medical system especially in Italy in the early weeks. According to one study, on tissue paper the virus survives less than three hours, on wood and cloth two days, on glass and banknotes four days and on stainless steel and plastic a week. The hope that it would die down during the summer is fading. As one team of scientists argues: “there is no evidence to suggest that warmer conditions in northern hemisphere summer months will reduce the effectiveness of Sars-CoV-2 transmission”.The pandemic is not under control yet. Since March the global death toll has doubled in six days twice. At that rate it would kill more than 600,000 people by the end of April and 10 million by the end of May. But of course that will probably not happen because interventions will have an effect – and predictions based on models are all over the place. Countries that have imposed strict national lockdowns are beginning to see the curve flatten, though not as fast as expected. Italy’s death toll shot up again on Friday despite people being confined to their homes for nearly three weeks.The measures that will bring this nightmare to an end include: first, more and better testing, and the tracing of every contact that an infected person makes. What makes it possible in the modern world is the digital footprint we all leave behind: privacy concerns will have to be put on hold. Second, more and better treatment of those who get ill, including more ventilators but also experimental repurposing of drugs including anti-HIV drugs and antimalarials such as chloroquine. Third, the use of monoclonal antibody drugs specifically designed to fight the virus. Fourth, probably some time next year, a vaccine.As research progresses, the picture is becoming ever clearer.

There is no shortage of food, just an excess of demand as people stock up. So far, at least.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to making sure everyone is fed, the front line of the fight is not in the pasta aisle at Tesco as shoppers scrap it out for the last pack of fusilli, but in fields up and down the country.British farmers warned this week of a coronavirus-induced labour shortage that could see millions of tonnes of strawberries, cabbages, apples, cauliflower lettuce and more rotting in the fields.‘Green lanes’ could ease shortages of fruit and veg to European shopsFor many years, the bounty of Britain\u0027s agricultural land has been picked and packed mostly by Eastern European hands. Work that years ago used to be the preserve of students making some extra money over the summer is now almost exclusively done by migrant labour.Some of those seasonal workers, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania, a few from Lithuania, are already in the UK but restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 mean there is a shortage of about 50,000 seasonal workers, presenting a serious problem for farmers.To plug the gap they have joined forces and launched a nationwide recruitment drive, calling on Britons to Feed the Nation by taking up seasonal roles in the fields. It\u0027s hoped that those who may have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis - chefs, retail assistants, waiters and others - will seize an opportunity for a very different kind of work.So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its own Pick for Britain campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\u0026nbspMost places are OK for labour at this point, but in six weeks we\u0027ll be picking, says James Porter, whose family owns East Scryne Farm, a soft fruit farm near Carnoustie, home of the storied golf course on Scotland\u0027s east cost.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith a picking season that starts in early May, soft fruit farmers are at the sharp end of a potential coronavirus labour shortage.Most of East Scryne\u0027s pickers would normally arrive at the end of April to start picking raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries - the fruit that\u0027s often seen as the quintessential symbol of British summer.\u0026nbspGovernment adviser under fire for saying UK farming sector not neededBrexit is an chance to showcase Britain’s farmingStrawberry, white chocolate and pistachio choux bunsFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryHeartbreaking photo of elderly man by empty supermarket shelvesWe\u0027re concerned that we won\u0027t be able to bring those people over and we have to look at alternatives, says Porter.The farmers\u0027 call to arms needs to be answered soon if we are to avoid a supply shortage that would trigger higher prices. If things drag on, the apple harvest could suffer as could vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, celery and cabbage.That would mean more imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. But other countries are experiencing their own problems. In Kenya, a major supplier of Europe\u0027s green beans and peas, Reuters reports that half of workers involved in growing and exporting have been sent home as flights are grounded and prices for freight rise.Spain is Europe\u0027s largest exporter of fruit and vegetables and a big supplier to the UK. But it too relies on thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Morocco, who have also been stranded at home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.It\u0027s fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable surroundings.It\u0027s hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they do, says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of England\u0027s vegetable production.It\u0027s not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys do, he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets\u0027 exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as how to cut it and pack it. For that they\u0027ll earn £12 an hour if they\u0027re good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised accommodation.The process is more high-tech than most would probably imagine, says Beverly Dixon, group HR director at G\u0027s, a network of large farms growing salad vegetables across East Anglia.We harvest our products in rigs, little mobile factories that go out into the field. They cut the veg at the front of the machine, it travels along a conveyor belt, gets trimmed, wrapped, boxed and put onto pallets all in one go, ready to be transported.Each rig is manned by a team of 16 who work as a family unit and will be kept apart from others as part of social distancing measures the farm is introducing.G\u0027s is looking for 700 seasonal staff, many of them pickers, but also jobs in packhouses and processing operations, team leaders, quality checkers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, forklift operators, some administrators and a handful of engineers.Bardsley, one of Britain\u0027s biggest apple producers, with an 850-hectare estate in Kent, says that in just a few days since the recruitment campaign launched the response has been overwhelming.Come July, when Bardsley starts harvesting 90 million apples - mostly Royal Gala, Braeburn, Cox\u0027s and the farm\u0027s prize-winning Bramleys - it will need some 500 extra workers. We\u0027ve put out the message on our social media saying \u0027come and join us\u0027, particularly to those people who unfortunately may be out of work at the moment. We are not slowing down, says marketing director Georgia Bardsley.We\u0027ve had such a erse range of people getting in touch. Among them are many who had until recently been working the hospitality sector that\u0027s been hit so hard by the coronavirus, including one head chef.Hopefully it gives people who have been affected a bit of hope, says Bardsley.The company\u0027s agricultural technology director, Antony Yousefian, says he\u0027s quietly confident the farm will find the people it needs. He also sees another potential positive to the situation.We\u0027ve seen a big change in consumers wanting to connect with what they eat in the last few years, he says. What a great opportunity for people to do that.I think, longer term, students will come back to doing this as a summer job.More and more of our jobs are higher skilled. We\u0027re hiring software engineers now, we\u0027ve got data analysts. So if you are a graduate, what a way to get into a farming business and apply yourself. In the day earn a bit of money and in the evening you might do some data analysis.Yousefian is currently building a digital map of the orchard to help the farm managers make better decisions by giving them real-time data on things like the climate, soil health and how much fruit is on the trees.The whole industry is changing. It\u0027s not a job that you turn your nose up at anymore.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But those are the headlines the difference lies in the details.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Employees (and employers) will have to wait until the end of April to get their money. For the self-employed, there’s no prospect of the cash coming in until “the beginning of June”.That’s a yawning gap of time for someone to go without income.Why the longer wait? Because the Treasury will have to establish an entirely new scheme to process claims from the self-employed.Officials will have to look at three years of declared self-employment tax returns so they can decide what the appropriate replacement income is for that worker, based on their average earnings.What of those who have only filed returns for one year or two? Officials will, apparently, use their discretion to decide on the right amount of compensation.And those who haven’t yet filed any tax returns at all?The chancellor made it clear they will, unfortunately, have to fall back on the welfare system, albeit one that has been made more generous in recent weeks. For some, that will mean a serious drop in income.And those self-employed who need cash now? They can try to access small-business loans. Or, again, there’s the unemployment benefits system safety net.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they’ve swallowed a lot of late.It seems that Rishi Sunak wasn’t planning to do anything initially for the self-employed beyond boosting the benefits system.This was never tenable given the fact that this group of workers has grown so rapidly as a share of the workforce in recent years and that they are, on average, less well off than employees.In the past, many would actually have been regular employees but for the perverse incentives of the tax system and cost-cutting employers.Government support for low and middle-income employees but not the low and middle-income self-employed would have been manifestly unjust.The government has – rightly – come a long way in a short time on this.However, with joblessness already rising fast and businesses struggling with the support schemes already set up, it would be rash to bet against ministers having to go further still in the coming weeks of this crisis.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It came as workers in key sectors work overtime and cancel holidays during the outbreak.“Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Alok Sharma, the business secretary.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today’s changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised.”Under existing rules, full-time workers are entitled to at least 28 days’ holiday including bank holidays each year, equivalent to 5.6 weeks.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe majority of this allowance cannot be carried over so employees lose it if they do not take it. Changes announced on Friday will apply to the Working Time Regulations which apply to most workers, including those employed through an agency and people on zero-hours contracts.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “From our fields to our supermarkets, we are hugely grateful to the many people working around the clock to keep the nation fed.“At this crucial time, relaxing laws on statutory leave will help ensure key workers can continue the important work to keep supplies flowing, but without losing the crucial time off they are entitled to.”He paid tribute to measures taken by the food industry to keep shelves stocked through the crisis. Supermarkets and logistics firms have increased the maximum daily shifts for lorry drivers from 10 hours to 11 hours to help ramp up deliveries after shoppers stripped many supermarkets bare.\u0026nbspThe government’s latest move to support workers comes after a raft of measures including state funding for up to 80 per cent of wages for employees who have no work during the crisis.On Thursday the chancellor extended that support to the self-employed, who can claim 80 per cent of the average of their last three years of profits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns. People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It came as workers in key sectors work overtime and cancel holidays during the outbreak.“Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Alok Sharma, the business secretary.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today’s changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised.”Under existing rules, full-time workers are entitled to at least 28 days’ holiday including bank holidays each year, equivalent to 5.6 weeks.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe majority of this allowance cannot be carried over so employees lose it if they do not take it. Changes announced on Friday will apply to the Working Time Regulations which apply to most workers, including those employed through an agency and people on zero-hours contracts.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “From our fields to our supermarkets, we are hugely grateful to the many people working around the clock to keep the nation fed.“At this crucial time, relaxing laws on statutory leave will help ensure key workers can continue the important work to keep supplies flowing, but without losing the crucial time off they are entitled to.”He paid tribute to measures taken by the food industry to keep shelves stocked through the crisis. Supermarkets and logistics firms have increased the maximum daily shifts for lorry drivers from 10 hours to 11 hours to help ramp up deliveries after shoppers stripped many supermarkets bare.\u0026nbspThe government’s latest move to support workers comes after a raft of measures including state funding for up to 80 per cent of wages for employees who have no work during the crisis.On Thursday the chancellor extended that support to the self-employed, who can claim 80 per cent of the average of their last three years of profits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns. People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Under the disobliging headline “The Independent: a newspaper killed by the internet”, a piece in one of our competitors commented: “While a cacophony of voices exists online, the loss of a groundbreaking newspaper which was once considered radical and anti-establishment is likely to be keenly felt at a time of political upheaval and discontent.”While not as disobliging as the wreath sent round by another rival to the Indy’s editorial offices to welcome the launch of the first edition in October 1986, this death certificate was also premature – and completely wrong in its reasoning.

Interestingly, herbivores such as sauropods and ornithischian dinosaurs are rare.“Many of the predators, including the toothed pterosaurs, preyed on a superabundance of fish.”Professor\u0026nbspMartill said: “We are in a golden age for discovering pterodactyls. This year alone we have discovered three new species and we are only into March.”The new pterosaurs – identified from chunks of jaws and teeth found in the middle cretaceous Kem Kem Beds of Morocco – had wings of three to four metres.The spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “These aerial fishers snatched up their prey while on the wing, using a murderous-looking set of large spike-like teeth that formed a highly effective tooth grab.“Large pterosaurs such as these would have been able to forage over vast distances, similar to present-day birds such as condors and albatrosses.”One of the species, anhanguera, was previously only known from Brazil.Another, ornithocheirus, had until now only been found in England and middle Asia.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ian Colbeck, professor of environmental science at the University of Essex, told The Independent that the reduction in global emissions will most likely be temporary.“Emissions tend to bounce back fairly quickly shortly after a crisis ends,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Expect to see short-term impacts on energy and emissions disappear as governments introduce stimulus packages to increase industrial output at the end of the pandemic. Following the global financial crash in 2008-09, carbon emissions increased by 5 per cent as a result of such stimulus.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMany environmental experts say the pandemic presents an unprecedented opportunity to curb global emissions.Professor Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, told The Independent that the UK government “has an amazing opportunity to shape the economy in a slightly different way” by incentivising companies to adopt low-carbon business models. The Conservative government has pledged to make the UK carbon-free by 2050.“We are spending money on almost every company in the country right now. What we should be doing is saying, ‘You can have this money but you need to be compliant with a zero-carbon future by 2050,’” Professor\u0026nbspSiegert said.According to Professor Siegert, the transition to a low-carbon economy requires trillions of pounds of investment. If it is all spent on managing the coronavirus outbreak, “we will not have the financial muscle to invest in a low-carbon future”, he said.Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), has also warned that the pandemic could stall global efforts to transition towards clean energy.“We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise our efforts to tackle the world’s inescapable challenge,” he said in a\u0026nbspstatement.Wildflowers move north as Earth’s temperature continues to riseThe IEA has already predicted that global oil demand will sharply decrease in 2020, by 435,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, due to the pandemic.“The sharp decline in the oil market may well undermine clean energy transitions by reducing the impetus for energy efficiency policies,” Dr Birol said.Cheaper energy reduces the appeal of cleaner, more efficient cars, homes and offices, Dr Birol said, calling on governments to reduce subsidies for fossil fuels. Coronavirus is also likely to stall production of clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, while many parts of China are under lockdown.“Governments can use the current situation to step up their climate ambitions and launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. Rather than compounding the tragedy by allowing it to hinder clean energy transitions, we need to seize the opportunity to help accelerate them,” Dr Birol said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Premium.Exclusive: Fears that pulling out EU watchdog will make country ‘a dumping ground’ for products linked to cancer, thyroid disease and hormone and developmental problems\u0026nbspThe UK will be powerless to prevent potentially dangerous chemicals being used in everyday goods because Boris Johnson is pursuing an ultra-hard Brexit, campaigners are warning.The country will become “a dumping ground” for products linked to cancer, thyroid disease, hormone disruption\u0026nbspand developmental problems because the prime minister insists on pulling out of the EU’s successful watchdog, they say.It means the UK must start from scratch in vetting hazardous chemicals itself – but with far less money and staff,\u0026nbspin a process expected to take many years.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the interim, manufacturers will be able to successfully challenge attempts to exclude chemicals banned in the EU – in everything from food and drink packaging and paints to furniture, carpets, clothing and even toys,\u0026nbspthe groups fear.“If we don’t have access to the safety data then the government could be challenged in the courts over decisions and it could lose,” warned Libby Peake, of the Green Alliance think tank.Boris Johnson trade deal plan ‘little better than no-deal Brexit’And Dr Michael Warhurst, executive director of Chem Trust campaigning charity, said: “We risk spending most of our time trying to instal a database with no data on it – and not having time to develop any new controls.”The controversy has blown up after Mr Johnson ditched Theresa May’s plan for “associate membership” of EU agencies, including the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and its database known as Reach.It would involve following all decisions on chemicals in Reach, without a vote, and oversight by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) – which are both red lines to a prime minister pledging “no alignment”.In its aims for an EU trade deal, the UK is now arguing for “separate regulatory requirements” – which would rule out access to the database or the exchange of confidential business information.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye

Not as bad as you’d thinkWill the coronavirus crisis derail Brexit talks?Treasury Budget figures confirm there was no £350m a week from BrexitJohnson will forfeit your human rights to get his way with Brexit* Bisphenols – known to disrupt the body’s hormone system, some are banned from use in babies’ bottles and infant cups and, soon, from thermal paper till receipts. However, firms are starting to use other bisphenols “that raise similar concerns about toxicity”, the group says.* Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – used in non-stick pans, waterproof fabrics, food packaging and cosmetics, they have been linked to cancers, thyroid disease, obesity and reproductive problems, but only two of 4,000 chemicals in the group have been banned so far.* Phthalates – added to plastics to increase durability, they are found in furnishings, flooring, clothing, paint and some toys. With pregnant women and children most vulnerable – exposure in the womb has been linked to poor reproductive organ development in boys, early onset of female puberty, and delayed language development – they are partly restricted in the EU.* Flame retardants – added to sofas, mattresses, electronic products, carpeting, building materials and car seats to hinder the spread of fires, they build up in homes and the environment and some are known to be cancer causing. Many are banned, but – again – similar chemicals are now being used.The UK expects to spend £13m a year on its regulator, employing 35 to\u0026nbsp40 staff, but Reach boasts 589 staff and a budget topping €100m\u0026nbsp(£89m) – yet has still failed to vet all chemicals after more than a decade’s work.Dr Warhurst warned: “There is a big difference between being able, theoretically, to control chemicals and actually being able to do it, with much less data, fewer people – and perhaps under pressure from a US trade deal.“These chemical companies have a record of going to court when restrictions are imposed.”And Ms Peake added: “For two years at least after the transition period, we will no longer have access to the EU’s database and, therefore, access to the safety data.“During that period, there is a risk that companies will try to use chemicals in the UK that have been banned or restricted at an EU level, on the grounds that we don’t have the background safety data to justify a decision.”But a government spokesperson said: “Spurious claims that the UK will in some way start accepting dangerous chemicals are simply unfounded scaremongering.“We are ready to provide the essential and safe regulation of chemicals. We will maintain a strong system that safeguards both human health and the environment.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, Mr Khan’s spokesman insisted ministers were told “countless times” that Tube frequencies reflect high levels of staff sickness and self-isolation.Shortly before 7am on Wednesday, a senior nurse named Danny posted on Twitter: “Another busy tube. Can we not stagger people’s start times so we aren’t all squashed on the same tube! This is unsafe and not fair!”Barry Trimble, who said his work involves ensuring cancer patients receive chemotherapy, posted an image of a busy Victoria line carriage shortly after 7am on Wednesday.“The Tube is packed, with social distancing impossible. We need more people to stay at home and more trains running in morning and evening peak.”The Tube is currently operating at around 50 per cent of its normal capacity during peak times. Transport for London\u0026nbsp(TfL)\u0026nbsphas pledged to “continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can”.On Tuesday Mr Hancock said: “Transport for London should have the Tube running in full so that people travelling on the Tube are spaced out and can be further apart – obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.“And there is no good reason in the information that I’ve seen that the current levels of Tube provision should be as low as they are. We should have more Tube trains running.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Beshear has ordered all non-essential retail businesses closed until the end of a state of emergency, which has also seen him activate the national guard.The governor’s tone remained even throughout his address, but he made clear that the circumstances of the new case had infuriated him.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“My job in these press conferences is to talk to you about how we’re going to get through it — and we are — and that we’re going to do everything we can to protect the lives of those around us.“But this is one that makes me mad. And it should make you mad. Ultimately, the power of forgiveness — we get through this, we should forgive that person. But no more of these, anywhere, statewide, ever, for any reason.”The party seems to have been held by a group of young adults defying social distancing orders. Similar gatherings have been condemned in other states.In New York, now the epicentre of the US outbreak, a full lockdown has had to be imposed to stop people violating distancing rules. In Florida, meanwhile, CBS interviews showed young college students on spring break openly dismissing the risk of infection while drinking and mingling on the streets. “If I get corona, I get corona,” said one.Mr Beshear clearly has no truck with this behaviour.

They do numerical projections, and then you plan based on the projection. You plan based on the data, based on the science, based on the numbers.\u0026nbspThe data says that is the high point of need,” the governor said on Saturday.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“You could need 140,000 hospital beds, and you could need 30,000 ventilators and that’s what the numerical projections say. So we’re planning for that, quote unquote, worst case scenario, which the models predict.”Mr Cuomo also postponed the state’s primary election from April until June, to avoid people gathering.\u0026nbspMr Cuomo’s comments same a day after Donald Trump attacked him on Twitter saying that ventilators sent to New York should be deployed immediately.\u0026nbspThe point is, ‘Well they’re in a stockpile, you must not need them’ is just ignorant — of course you don’t need them today!,” Mr Cuomo said on Friday. “You need them when you hit the apex, which is 30,000.

At the same time, if he failed to prepare for the worst he would not be doing his job.The comments underscore what has emerged as a potential major problem as the crisis has played out in the US, and Mr Trump has sought make the inidual states take responsibility for tackling the disease, with the support – but not leadership – of the federal government.Several state governors have condemned this approach, among them Washington governor Jay Inslee who told Mr Trump the governors were looking for a quarterback like “Tom Brady”.On Saturday, Mr Cuomo said the total number of infections in the state had reached more than 52,000 people, and the death toll had reached more than 700.“The government has said they have sent us 4000 ventilators those 4000 ventilators are not currently in use.\u0026nbspWhy? Because we don’t need them,” added Mr Cuomo.\u0026nbsp“What we’re doing is we’re planning for that apex, we’re planning for the critical need, and making sure we have the equipment the staff, the beds, for that critical need.”He said the cost of the machines had increased from $25,000 to $45,000 as other states had sought to buy them.\u0026nbspHe added: “We’re literally bringing up the price ourselves.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here is some of the other news you may have missed during the past week:One of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s key henchmen has been identified in an indictment prepared by Turkish prosecutors over the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGreece and the EU have lost control of the issue on the Turkish borderSaad Qahtani, the architect of Prince Mohammed’s notorious online harassment and intimidation operations, was identified among 20 suspects indicted in the murder of Mr Khashoggi.Mr Qahatani, who is also the palace “fixer” who sought to silence dissident voices at home and abroad, is among Saudi security officials accused of luring Mr Khashoggi the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, then allegedly torturing, murdering and dismembering him.\u0026nbspThe indictment seeks prison sentences for the accused on charges of “premeditated murder with monstrous intent” according to a statement by the Istanbul prosecutor-general.Riyadh\u0026nbsphas cleared Mr Qahtani of any ties to the killing.At least 17 people injured – including a 15-year-old girl left in a critical condition – when a strong earthquake rocked Croatia.Newborn babies had to be evacuated from a maternity hospital following the 5.3-magnitude tremor – the biggest to hit the capital Zagreb in 140 years.Power was cut and people ran out of their homes in terror as rooftops collapsed, including one of the spires on the iconic cathedral.Maternity staff moved incubators to a new location with the help of the army.The quake forced people to ignore government warnings to avoid public spaces such as parks and squares to slow the spread of Covid-19.Soldiers helped to clear the debris from the streets, and prime minister Andrej Plenkovic urged citizens to remain calm and stay outside their homes in the central parts of Zagreb, which sustained the most damage.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These were then posted to chatrooms on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, where 10,000 people used cryptocurrencies to pay up to £1,000 for access.Police identified 24-year-old suspect Cho Ju-bin, after 5 million people signed petitions urging them to do so.

A sentencing date has yet to be set.After the killings, New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern vowed never to say the accused man’s name.Four men have been executed in India for the gang rape and murder of a woman on a Delhi bus in 2012, in a case that drew unprecedented attention to the prevalence of sexual assault in India.“The four convicts were hanged together at 5.30am,” announced Sandeep Goel, head of the Tihar jail on the outskirts of the capital where the men were being held.Despite the early hour, hundreds gathered outside the jail to celebrate the men’s deaths, holding placards that read “Justice for women” and “Hang the culprits”.The victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, became known in the media as Nirbhaya – the fearless one – as she could not be named under Indian law.On the night of the attack, she boarded a private bus after visiting the cinema with a male friend.\u0026nbsp Both were brutally beaten by five men and one 17-year-old boy on the bus, while the perpetrators repeatedly raped the woman. They were dumped naked on the roadside and while the friend survived, Nirbhaya died of her wounds in hospital two weeks later.Asha Devi, the mother of the victim, told reporters she held a photograph of her daughter as the execution was carried out: “Today, justice has been done after seven years.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It has just taken this crisis to give us all a wake-up call to realise what is most important — our family, our friends and our fellow human beings.In my street we have set up a WhatsApp group so we can all help each other out getting shopping, medicine and simply checking to seeeveryone, especially the elderly and those living alone, are doing OK.And tens of thousands of you have heeded the Government’s call and volunteered to help deliver medicines and supplies to vulnerable patients on lockdown.I have signed up to have a chat with anyone who needs a bit of reassurance.Cab drivers are giving pensioners free transport. LA Taxis in Newcastle picked up dozens of elderly people to take them to the local supermarket and back home again with their essentials.Our youngsters have also been amazing.James Burnett, , from Grimsby, set up a Facebook group to connect people who want to help — and thousands have joined.He has also been taking sandwiches to his local hospital with sister Ellie-Mae, , and brothers Robbie, six and Oscar, four. I know hungry NHS workers enduring gruelling long shts are so grateful to these big-hearted youngsters.It truly brings a tear to my eye and I am so proud of all these thoughtful acts.To raise my spirits, I go for a daily walk with my little dog Angus. I do not see as many people as usual — and I obviously keep a safe distance from any I do — but I have seen a real change in attitude.Everyone now shouts a cheery greeting or exchanges a rueful smile and wave.There is a real sense of us all being in this together.Like many of you, I have been feeling anxious and unsettled, but focusing on the positives has been keeping me sane.YOU are our heroes daily!!! Thank you!!! We love you.KURT RIEMERYOU’RE all truly amazing.SOPHIA GODWINMaybe, just maybe, all of these small but important acts of kindness and that renewed and revitalised community spirit will continue when the virus has been defeated. And remember: We will get through this.In the meantime, it will be more bearablewe all take care of each other.What a wonderful day it will be when we are able to embrace all of those we love and hold them tight to our hearts.­To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cross-contamination is rampant. The animal cruelty is off the scale.Bears, tigers,  wolf cubs, crocodiles, hedgehogs and turtles are not spared in this notorious wildle food trade, either.Now the despicable wet markets used by some Chinese people — markets already responsible for the Sars outbreak in  — have finally brought the world to its knees.Scientists have established that it is highly likely Covid- was linked to a notorious live animal market in Wuhan.Gene sequencing analysis shows the new coronavirus probably started in bats and was transferred to humans via the scaly anteater the pangolin.So why is there so little outrage about the wet markets that we know have the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes to human health Even Donald Trump — slammed for branding Covid- the “Chinese virus” — avoided criticising the wet markets when prompted during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.Maybe that’s because the moment someone tries to speak up they are accused of racism.That happened to reality star and retail entrepreneur Luisa Zissman earlier this week when she posted a video on Instagram of a wet market and called for them to be “banned completely”.After the usual social media outrage, she told me: “I wholeheartedly disagree with this particular part of Chinese culture, but that does not make me racist.” It should be remembered there are many campaigners within China desperately trying to get the wet markets banned too.After all, the addition of more exotic animals only dates back to the s, as the ruling communist party struggled to feed the population and million people perished in what became known as the great famine.By , the ironically named Wildle Protection Law encouraged industrial-level breeding of the likes of bears, bats and turtles to be sold through wet markets. And that’s when the viruses began to form.When the Sars crisis was linked to a wet market in southern China, officials shut it down and made wildle farming illegal. But they reversed the decision just a few months later.As of  it was a £billion industry, mainly because the rich and the powerful pay copious quantities of money to eat rare wildle as they believe  claims about their role in Chinese medicine.Now with coronavirus spreading, the government has again temporarily banned wildle trading and shut down wet markets.But it’s not permanent yet — and it must be.We already know that the early Chinese cover-up of Covid-, which makes Chernobyl look like a misdemeanour, resulted in the disease’s rapid spread.In fact,China had taken early action experts reckon the number of coronavirus cases could have been cut by  per cent, making its rampage all over the globe far less likely.The new illness was directly linked to the infamous wildle market in Wuhan on December , but it wasn’t until New Year’s Eve that the World Health Organisation was informed and the site closed.The brave Chinese doctors who tried to spread the word about Covid- were shut down by the authorities too, and early testing was stopped and samples  destroyed.I have no doubt the Chinese government has blood on its hands over coronavirus.And saying that now, at the peak of the health crisis, is not the time to tackle the issue is wrong.We must have this uncomfortable discussion while our anger is raw and the pain  all too real.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.I DON’T have enough superlatives to describe my adoration for Lady Gaga.No pop star of her generation has been more consistently savvy, smart or, for that matter, talented.So it pains me to so deeply disagree with her decision to delay the release of her highly anticipated new album Chromatica, which was due to drop on April , in the middle of quarantine hell.In fact, I actually think the delay is quite selfish.Thanks to the technological advances in streaming, listening to new music is one of the few activities we can engage in collectively without having to leave the house. Gaga wrote that: “It just doesn’t feel right to me to release this album with all that is going on during this global pandemic.”Instead she wants us all to focus on “finding solutions”, such as providing medical equipment and school meals.All very good aims, of course.But what the world also needs now is music, sweet music, to unite us and, frankly, distract us.She’s also made a strategic error, given she had a captive audience with time on their hands at home to stream to their heart’s content.This is the time for the UK to show that, eight decades on, we still have the Blitz spirit in our blood.Many of our parents or grandparents were sent to the front line to fight Hitler.All most of us have to do is put our lives temporarily on hold while scoffing Domino’s pizza and watching Netflix.I don’t for a second underestimate the signicance of such a call, by the way.These are dark days and there is a growing coronavirus-shaped cloud over our daily lives right now, causing extreme stress and anxiety.It’s so easy to feel angry and uncertain and tearful and depressed.Like you, I’ve been through the gamut of emotions while practising social distancing.However, that is simply not an excuse not to try to  carry on with your normal lives.It won’t be for ever. In fact, the sooner we do this properly, the sooner this nightmare will be over.At such a trying time it is imperative we celebrate the brilliant work being done by so many to keep society running.So thank you to the doctors, the nurses, the NHS workers, the first responders, the supermarket staff, the cleaners, the bus drivers, the Tube staff, the delivery drivers, the journalists and anyone  who NEEDS to keep working to keep our society going.They’ll thank the rest of us for doing our part too and staying indoors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor.

I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus.

She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks.

I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Here, he offers guidance to six readers.Q: I LIVE in a town so I am likely to come into contact with peopleI go outside. Is it safer to drive myself and my dog to a remote place for our once-a-day exercise A: People need to stop driving to other places to walk and exercise. Every trip increases the risk of viral transmission.Q: I HAD pneumonia a few years ago. Am I more at risk of catching coronavirus A: Provided you recovered fully from your pneumonia there is nothing to suggest that you will be more at risk.Q: WE are all spending more time in our gardens now. Can insects and flies transmit the virus A: No. There is no evidence that biting insects can transmit the virus. It is a respiratory virus transmitted through droplets in the air. For the same reason, we are still encouraging people to donate blood at a time when stocks are low and constantly need to be topped up. NHS Blood And Transplant are using extra safety checks and people are being encouraged to come into centres to help.Q: I HAVE had stomach ache for the past couple of days and been making several trips to the toilet. I know it’s not something I ate. Could I have coronavirus A: Some people do experience diarrhoea with the virus but not usually without other Covid- symptoms, such as a fever, so it is unlikely. The guidance is that you do not need to self-isolate from family at home but just take extra personal hygiene precautions.Q: I HAVE had a cough and have been bringing up lots of phlegm. I also have a high temperature and wheezing. Is it possible it could be coronavirus A: It is possible since you have a fever, but the virus usually causes a dry cough rather than what’s called a productive cough.Q: I WAS a nurse for  years and retired a year and a half ago. I have fibromyalgia and Type  diabetes. Is it advisable for me to offer my services and go back to work for the NHS A: It’s lovely of you to consider coming back to work for the NHS in this current crisis.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres everything you need to know about the time change.On March , , the clocks go forward one hour at am.When the clocks turn forward an hour we enter British Summer Time or BST.This means theres more daylight in the evenings, and less in the mornings.Its also sometimes known as daylight savings time.The clocks always go forward one hour on the last Sunday in March.The UK observes the clock changing twice a year, when it goes back to GMT in October.Yes -you have an iPhone then it will have automatically changedyou have your date and time options set to set automatically.For all other smartphones, network operators should change the time accordinglyyou have automatic updates set to your phone.Howeveryoure still using a regular keypad brick-style mobile you might need to change your date and time manually.Sadly, the clocks going forward means you lose an hour of sleepThe clocks go forward to make better use of daylight.When changed to BST, we move an hour of daylight from the mornings to the evenings.In the winter the clocks go back to signal the approach of winter and fewer daylight hours by ensuring there’s more daylight in the mornings and less in the evenings.To help you remember which is which, think “spring forward, fall back”.British Summer Time came into existence with the Summer Time Act that was passed by Parliament in .Germany was the first country to adopt the plan on April , , and on May , Britain followed suit, during the height of the First World War.The campaign which led to the creation of BST and Daylight Savings Timewas started by William Willett in  in a bid to stop people wasting valuable hours of light in the summer months.By setting the clocks back in winter, Brits get an earlier sunrise and earlier sunset.In summer the sun rises and sets one hour later than it would without daylight saving.In a pamphlet called The Waste of Daylight, Willett suggested clocks should be advanced by  minutes over four stages in April, and reversed the same way in September.Supporters at the time of the proposal argued the scheme would save energy by reducing domestic coal consumption.They also said it would increase supplies available for the huge manufacturing cost of the war effort.It has been in place ever since – despite criticism from some groups.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister has been warned by scientists that official statistics from China - where Covid- first emerged in the city of Wuhan - may have been downplayed “by a factor of  to  times”. The flu-like virus has now killed , people, including more than , in the UK, and is causing a global health emergency. Coronavirus is thought to have jumped from animals to humans at a “wet” or live animal market in Wuhan, a major transport hub in Hubei province.This has led to calls for the country to improve its record on animal rights, amid warnings from experts that the filthy conditions in Asia’s wildle markets are a “ticking time bomb” for new deadly pandemics. A senior minister went as far as to say thatChina does not clamp down on these markets, it risks becoming a pariah state. “We have always known their wildle markets are a recipe for a pandemic. China needs to close these down immediately,” they said.

The sight of groups of MPs gathering in groups to pass laws stopping the rest of us from gathering in groups was not a good look. It appeared literally like one law for the lawmakers and another for the locked-down rest of us. So Parliament upped sticks till after Easter. The Speaker had already ­announced a ban on alcohol in the Commons so it was questionable how long MPs would be able to sustain themselves anyway. The forward agenda was thin. Whether or not the scheduled Bill on toilet rate reliefwas “essential” was questionable in the current climate. But before packing their bags, MPs first had to provide legislative authority to the most draconian range of powers ever granted to the state in peacetime. Or indeed wartime. Hitler and the Luftwaffe never closed the bars or theatres and never imprisoned the population in the way that coronavirus has succeeded in doing. Forced quarantining, cancelled ­elections, allowing a single doctor – rather than two – to section people and reducing Parliamentary scrutiny of the state, including the security services. It’s a menu to whet the appetite of any would-be authoritarian tyrant. And it’s one that worries MPs. What , they fear, some of these emergency changes to the way we live were to slip into normality in the longer term  The Government was forced to accept that the powers enshrined in the Coronavirus Act – rushed through the Commons and Lords in just two days – should be reviewed every six months. How that works remains to be seen. Suspicions were raised as to whether the -page Bill – yes, parts of it have been up Whitehall’s sleeve for a while – was necessary at all. The Speaker’s own legal counsel, Daniel Greenberg, says all the ­provisions are covered by existing law. He should know – he wrote them.  The Government says the existing ones are “the wrong sort of law”. All sides in Westminster agree, the country is going through change and it must emerge stronger and better. The challenges are profound. Hot on the heels of the virus bill came another, supported by all parties, the Future Generations Bill. It calls for new procedures to take longer-term ­thinking into mainstream policy ­making, presenting Parliament with “an ­opportunity to act today for tomorrow, and level up opportunity between­ ­current and future generations”.

You may have to do those tests two or three dferent times because you need all the time to be able to track whataposs happening with the disease, to learn where, for example, there may be a surge or a hotspot of it, and take immediate action.Mr Blair said it would be perfectly possible for Boris Johnson to run the country from his living room, during his coronavirus self-isolation.He said: The PM is able to direct this but itaposs how you put the most capable people in charge of logistics and procurement.

Rubbish could soon pile up in Britain’s streets as  per cent of the work force is off sick. Workers also say social distancing is impossible in a refuse lorry. “The biggest problem we’ve had is social distancing – trying to keep two metres apart,” one bin man told The Daily Star. “When you’re a bin man you tend to sit in the wagon with three guys, so ­obviously you can’t have a two- metre gap.” The worker, from the East Midlands, says their requests of face masks have been rejected. Worryingly, he claims they often see used tissues at the top of bins. Councils across the country have scaled back household bin collections and many recycling centres have closed in the wake of the pandemic. Another bin man described the dficulty as they face mountains of extra rubbish. He said: “Our problem is the public at home, online shopping and panic buying. With staff shortages and extra waste we are very stretched.” Stuart Richards, of the GMB union, added: “Our members working on the bins are key workers. The least they can expect is for their employers to take some responsibility and put adequate measures in place to keep them safe.” Earlier this week, a national business waste company warned that panic buying will result in an increased amount of food being thrown away. Mark Hall, of Business Waste, said: “At the moment there is a huge strain on supermarket supply chains to ensure there is enough food to go around during these dficult times. For those concerned they have coronavirus in the UK, Public Health England has issued advice about how to self-isolate. . Stay at home: Donapost leave your house except when you need to seek medical care. Ask for help buying groceries or have them delivered. . Stay away from your housemates: Stick in a well-ventilated room away from others, with the door closed. Use a separate bathroom and wear a facemask when it shared areas. . Call ahead before visiting the doctors so they can take extra precautionary measures. . Cover you coughs and sneezes: Make sure to cover your nose and mouth and to throw away disposable tissues in a plastic waste bag. . Wash your hands regularly: This should be done often and thoroughly with soap and water, for at least  seconds, rinse and dry thoroughly. . Avoid sharing household items: You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding or other items with other people in your home when you have used them.

On Monday, Mr Johnson put in place the strict measures with the police even given the power to issue fines after many had been ignoring previous instructions to remain indoors and maintain social distancing. The Government hopes its policy of self-isolation and social distancing will help to delay and slow the peak of the pandemic and allow the NHS to cope. But even on Saturday it appeared as though the instructions were being ignored with people spotted sunbathing and even having an outdoor boxing class in the spring sunshine.  In London, joggers and dog walkers crowded Battersea Park despite social distancing rules to stay at least six feet apart from one another. A number of shops still open have implemented their own measures to ensure its customers do not further spread the contagious virus. Many are only allowing a certain number of shoppers in at one time, while the rest have to queue outside in designated spaces, maintaining distance from each other.  Next week Boris Johnson will write to every UK household urging them to stay home, protect the NHS and save lives. The Prime Minister will also warn that the outbreak is going to get worse before it gets better. He will say: “From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time.  “We will not hesitate to go furtherthat is what the scientic and medical advice tells us we must do. “It’s important for me to level with you. We know things will get worse before they get better. “But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner le canto normal.

In just a few short weeks, everyday le in this country has changed dramatically. We all feel the profound impact of coronavirus not just on ourselves, but on our loved ones and our communities. I understand completely the dficulties this disruption has caused to your lives, businesses and jobs. But the action we have taken is absolutely necessary, for one very simple reason. If too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to cope. This will cost lives. We must slow the spread of the disease, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment in order to save as many lives as possible. That is why we are giving one simple instruction - you must stay at home. You should not meet friends or relatives who do not live in your home. You may only leave your home for very limited purposes, such as buying food and medicine, exercising once a day and seeking medical attention. You can travel to and from work but should work from homeyou can. When you do have to leave your home, you should ensure, wherever possible, that you are two metres apart from anyone outside of your household. These rules must be observed. So,people break the rules, the police will issue fines and disperse gatherings. I know many of you will be deeply worried about the financial impact on you and your family. The Government will do whatever it takes to help you make ends meet and put food on the table. The enclosed leaflet sets out more detail about the support available and the rules you need to follow. You can also find the latest advice at gov.uk coronavirus From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time. We will not hesitate to go furtherthat is what the scientic and medical advice tells us we must do. It#xs important for me to level with you - we know things will get worse before they get better. But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner le canto normal. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus, in particular the staff in our fantastic NHS and care sector across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.It has been truly inspirational to see our doctors, nurses and other carers rise magnicently to the needs of the hour. Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are ing to the NHS - and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable. It is with that great British spirit that we will beat coronavirus and we will beat it together. That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.#xDBoris Johnson was in the meeting via a video call:KEY EVENTGovernment warned pandemic would swamp NHS with terrying resultsThe government was reportedly warned three years ago that the NHS would be quickly overwhelmed in the event of a severe disease outbreak.A major exercise testing the UK#xs ability to deal with a pandemic -

Speaking from the ship, which is stranded off the Pacic coast of Panama, -year-old Paul, from Huddersfield, said: “We feel such ­despair because we feel the Government wants to leave us adrt to die. “We haven’t had any word or a concerted effort from our Government. “The most frightening thing is we don’t know how anyone can manage the logistics of getting us home when we can’t even get into a port that will accept us.”  Cruise company Holland America is in a race to get healthy holidaymakers off the ship before the virus spreads further. Passengers are being tested for the bug and those in the clear are being transferred to sister ship, The Rotterdam, alongside it. Tonight the Wilsons’ daughter, Sally Dunkley, , said: “We are terried we will never see them again. Mum is so frightened she told us that the house now belongs to my brother and I, and Dad is checking all his le insurance is in order. “We are beyond worried. We’ve not had a word from the British Government about how they will deal with this. “The Rotterdam sent small boats with testing kits. Those who test positive will be left on the Zaandam which will essentially become a hospital ship.” The Wilsons’ ­journey went as planned until passengers started falling ill following a stop at Punta Arenas, Chile, on March . The ship tried to turn back to dock for passenger testing but was refused entry. There are fears the boat could become another Diamond Princess, which suffered  deaths after  passengers got Covid-. Guy Jones, son of fellow passengers Celia and Nick Jones, of Bristol, last night appealed for the UK Foreign Office to get involved. Nick, , a retired head teacher, and Celia, , went ahead with their holiday after Government guidelines said it was safe to travel to South America. Guy, , a theatre stage manager, said: “They seem to be quite well at the moment but our ­biggest worry is how they will get home. “When they were first put into lockdown on Monday, the announcement over the tannoy said about  people had fallen ill and it was a precautionary measure. But on Friday they were told four people had died.”  Elsewhere, British travellers stranded across the world have pleaded for chartered flights to be sent out after aircraft this week rescued , citizens stuck in Peru. Esther Hulme and Lewis Kellett, stranded in India, begged for help from the Foreign Office and claimed police “intimidate and beat” foreigners with sticks. India’s borders have been closed for  days to halt the spread of Covid- through its . billion population. Esther and Lewis, from Leeds, said they were kicked out of two hotels by staff and are now stuck in a hostel in Goa with  others, living off rice and crisps. Civil servant Esther, , said: “Today, queuing for food, police pulled out big sticks as an intimidation technique. I’ve heard of middle-aged British women left bruised from being hit. “The embassy advised us to follow local ­procedure but they don’t realise the reality.” Retired physicist John Siddle, , is among , Britons thought to be stranded in Bali. The grandad-of-three, from Southport, Merseyside, was quoted £, for a flight home via Australia to the UK.

Each morning, pictures emerge on social media showing queues of people lining up two metres apart outside supermarkets as they scramble to get their hands on essential items.But despite all this, supermarket staff have been going above and beyond in the face of adversity, reports Hull Live.Family, friends and customers have paid tribute to those working in food stores in Hull and East Riding to ensure everyone can still access their share of food.

She said: Debs Collinson, my pal who always has a smile on her face and makes and brightens customers’ day with her infectious laugh, who works at Sainsbury’s in Anlaby.”  Staff at Asda in Savoy Road are “exhausted and run off their feet” but that has not stopped them putting in extra hours to keep the community refuelled. Danielle Hunt said: “ASDA Savoy Road in Hull. “We are working extra hours days. We are exhausted and run off our feet but still remain with a friendly and customer focused team as always. I for one am so proud of this team.” Claire Grantham has appealed for people to not go shopping “for the sake of it” while celebrating her “amazing” mum. “My amazing mum Jill is working every day at Sainbury’s in Hessle. Only go out for the essentials, don’t go shopping for the sake of it and keep your distance from the staff when you are in store. “Remember they only get paid minimum wage.” Claire Woodley’s daughter Cha has health problems but is going far beyond what is expected both at work and to help her family. She is working hard at BM in Willerby and also checking on neighbours and grandparents to make sure they have enough. Sharing a picture of her daughter, Claire said: “This is my daughter Cha Oaten who is an amputee and has health problems.  She is working long hours in BM Willerby, messaging her grandma and neighbours to seethey need anything bringing home and making sure we have everything we need so we donapost have to go to the shops.” Bakery staff at Sainsbury’s in Hedon have also been singled out for praise.

Boris Johnson said yesterday that the pandemic crisis “would get worse before it gets better”.He was forced to conduct a video conference from his study in Number  Downing Street after himself testing positive for the virus. Senior figures in Government have been more optimistic saying restrictions could be eased sooner than June with the peak of the crisis predicted to come in the week of April  with , deaths. But Prof Ferguson of Imperial College told the Sunday Times: “We are going to have to keep these measures in place, in my view, for a signicant period of time - probably until the end of May, maybe even early June. May is optimistic. He said when the lockdown was lted people would still probably be asked to enforce some social distancing for months more. That could mean schools and universities not reopening until the Autumn and people told to continue working from home rather than ing to their offices. The grim diagnosis came after the death toll from coronavirus leapt  in a day to reach a total of , people. More than , people have tested positive. To ensure the lockdown works, the government is sending every household a leaflet on what to do and a letter from the prime minister, at a total cost of £. million. In it, the PM says: From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time. We will not hesitate to go furtherthat is what the scientic and medical advice tells us we must do. Itaposs important for me to level with you. We know things will get worse before they get better.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA chat at the school gates with a fellow dad saved Mark Wilson’s le. Mark, , was seriously ill with kidney disease but feared time was running out as he waited for a donor. He opened up to Andy McCall, , as they waited for their daughters. In an act of incredible selflessness, Andy offered to seehe was a match. Blood and tissue tests confirmed he was and the transplant went ahead on Valentine’s Day this year. Mark said: “When Andy offered, I couldn’t believe it. He was pretty much a complete stranger. “When my family heard he was a match, we burst into tears. Even the kidney co-ordinator was crying. “It felt like our paths meant to cross. He knows I’ll never be able to repay him. He has saved my le.”  Andy said: “Helping Mark was a no-brainer. “I had the chance to shape someone ’s le. There’s no better feeling.” Now the two fitness fans, who both have two young children, are the best of friends. A year ago Mark’s world came crashing down as he and we Victoria, , a marketing executive, from Gourock, near Glasgow, were planning a holiday with children, Emilie, five, and one-year-old Lucas.A routine check through his work at an Audi bodyshop found his blood pressure was up almost double.Mark, who works out three times a week, looked so healthy that medics initially thought there was something wrong with their kit. “They said, ‘There must be something wrong with the readings because you shouldn’t be able to stand’,” he recalled.  But tests at Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital showed he had  per cent kidney . He was diagnosed with stage five kidney disease and told he needed a transplant. By August, his kidneyhad declined to just seven per cent and he was told he would need to begin peritoneal dialysis, which uses the lining of the abdomen to filter the blood. He had a tube fitted in his stomach so he could carry out the treatment himself four times a day. Mark recalled: “Dialysis meant I couldn’t work anymore, and I actually started to feel ill for the first time. “I had no energy and could no longer play with the children for long, or go to the gym.”  We Victoria nicknamed him “the healthiest looking sick guy”. She explained: “When he was diagnosed, people kept saying to him ‘you don’t look sick’ or ‘for someone so ill you look great’ so I said one day he was the healthiest looking sick guy I’d ever seen and then the name stuck.” One day Mark got chatting to Andy, a college apprentice co-ordinator from Greenock, at the school gates as they collected their daughters from nursery. Struck by the similarities between the young families, Andy thought about what it would be likehis le was turned upside down. Meanwhile, Mark’s mum and we offered a kidney but they were not perfect matches. With Mark in desperate need of a donor, Victoria decided to run a km race to raise money for Kidney Research UK.She uploaded a post explaining her husband’s situation to Facebook, which was spotted by Andy.Moved by what he read, Andy – father of Lily, five, and Lewis, two, with his radiographer we Laura – offered to help. “It just felt like it could so easily be me,” he said. “The thought that my le could be taken away from me in an instant really hit home. “I said to Laura, ‘Our families are so similar, we are the same age, with kids the same age, and Mark and I are both into our fitness’.”The four-hour transplant operation took place with both dads side by side inhospital beds.Andy said: “Before we went in, we had our picture taken and wished one another other good luck.” Andy was able to be by Mark’s bedside as he came round from surgery. “I felt proud that I’d been given the opportunity to help change his le and his family’s le. It was an emotional moment,” said Andy. “I told him he was looking really good and we gave each other a high five.” Within  hours of the transplant, Mark’s kidneywent from six to . per cent. Andy stayed in hospital for three days, during which time he was a frequent visitor to Mark’s room. Mark was discharged after a week and both families got together the following night to toast his health with champagne. After taking a couple of months off work to recover, keen runner Andy is back to full health and was even able to run again just over a week after the operation. Mark is feeling “better than ever”. Victoria said: “After the operation, Mark immediately looked better, his blue eyes had started shining again and after a few days he was back on his feet, gradually building up strength and taking gentle exercise.” Having forged a lelong friendship, the men have been out for dinner and drinks, as well as taking their children to soft play together. Mark said: “We’re having to isolate for now because of Covid- but we’ve been keeping each other entertained over WhatsApp. “We’re in touch most days. And now I’ve got a runner’s kidney, maybe I’ll join him for a jog. “As well as getting a new kidney, I’ve got a new friendship. It’s hard to put into words how much it means.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eight signs you coronavirus covid","story":"NewsEight signs you had coronavirus Covid- before the outbreak - including symptomsResearch conducted by scientists at Oxford Universitys Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group devised one scenario in which millions of British people may have caught the coronavirus alreadyShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video six-mild-symptoms-coronavirus-you-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news eight-signs-you-coronavirus-covid-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Research carried out by Oxford Universityaposs Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group suggests that Covid- may have reached the UK by mid-January at the latest. The scenario is one of the several the researchers presented as possible, and goes against previously understood death rates. In the non-peer reviewed study they suggest that the coronavirus, like many emerging infections, may have spread invisibly for a month before its effects became clear at the end of February. If the Oxford researchers are right, then as much as half of the countryaposs population may already have been infected. Many people have contactedto claim that they experienced symptoms linked to Covid- in the weeks following the New Year. Below are the eight symptoms that may suggest you have already been infected by the coronavirus. Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blog Eye infections New research has indicated that eye infection such as conjunctivitis may be a symptom of Covid-. The College of Optometrists said: It is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid-. However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid- without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred. A dry cough Perhaps the most recognisable of the Covid- symptoms, given how dferent it can sound compared to a typical cough. The cough is generally new for you - or dferentyou generally have a smokeraposs cough - and persistant. More often than not it will last for at least half a day. Mental fatigue    Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue. Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache. The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. A high temperature    Although numbers y for dferent people, a rise in body temperature generally counts as a fever once it reaches .C . You can tell you have a feveryou feel hot to the touch on your chest or back. Itaposs dficult to catch your breath If your chest starts to feel tight or you cannot breath, you may have caught the coronavirus. Most young people or those without pre-existing health conditions are unlikely to experience this symptom. Dyspnea - the term for when someone has dficulty breathing - may be coupled with a tightness in the chest, rapid breathing and heart palpatations. Loss of sense of smell and taste    Over the weekend the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology warned that losing your sense of smell and taste may mean you have Covid-. The ear, nose and throat specialist recommended anyone with such symptoms self-isolate immediatley. It has been suggested that the phenomena may be caused by the coronavirus killing cells in the nose and throat. Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas, the Association said in a statement. We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus. Tummy ache    As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea. Physical fatigue    Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult.

The -year-old did not have severe symptoms and her family had hoped she would pull through to celebrate her th birthday on April , reports the Manchester Evening News. Hilda first showed signs of the virus four days ago and a test came back positive, confirming she was suffering from Covid-. Hilda is thought to be the oldest person in Greater Manchester to have contracted the virus. Her grandson Anthony Churchill says she will be greatly missed by her large extended family. “She did so much for us,” he says. “We were always with her on weekends as kids. She did so much for all the grandkids. “She was a proper grandma as well. She would always have a pinny on and she’d be baking. She just could not throw any food away. You’d never go hungry. “She was very loving. She couldn’t do enough for people.” Originally from Crewe, Hilda moved up to Salford with her husband during the depression to find work. Born in , the former seamstress, was a popular figure with her neighbours and was known for her kind nature and baking skills. “She always talks about the neighbours cadging a pinch of salt and other bits during the war,” Anthony says. “She’d still make the best homemade gravy I have ever tastedyou let her near a kitchen.  “And her scones and mince pies - people were queuing up the street to get them at Christmas. “She was very independent. She hated anyone having to do anything for her.” In the weeks before her death, Anthony had started to talk to his grandma about the virus. She was able to offer a perspective on the pandemic that few others could. He says: “My grandma likes to talk. As I was telling her about his coronavirus she started talking about the Spanish flu and she remembered how bad that was. “The whole house came down with it except her mum, who looked after everyone . “Sadly her little sister, who was only  months old, died of it. Grandma said she remembers a small box being put in a carriage. “Her dad collapsed in the street with it, but survived. “She was saying how amazing it is that something you can’t see can be so devastating.” Anthony, , says Hilda was in good health up until recently having never smoked or drunk much in her le and after staying active for decades. She only moved into the care home ten months ago and, up until then, had lived alone in her home in Walkden.  The mother-of-four, grandmother of eleven and great grandmother of  had, in recent years, also welcomed great grandchildren into the family. Anthony says: “My grandma never understood how she got so old and she’d say that. I think it was the hard work that kept her going.

However this work equipment can be the perfect environment for the virus to linger. Initial studies indicated the virus could survive for up to three days on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel. However, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found traces of Covid- on the Diamond Princess cruise ship  days after infected passengers had left. Public Health Englandsays the virus is mainly spread by coughs and sneezes with people nearby inhaling droplets. It can also be spread by getting people touching their facethe virus has got onto their hands. How long the virus survives depends on the type of surface,it’s exposed to sunlight, dferences in temperature and humidity and how often it’s cleaned. Whether you’re working from home or still having to go to work, you should clean your desk and the equipment you use, on a daily basispossible. This is on top of washing your hands for  seconds after being out, blowing your nose, sneezing, coughing or eating touching food. It is also possible that you could become infected by touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with the respiratory secretions from an infected person and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes,” said Dr Yimmy Chow, Consultant in Health Protection at PHE told the Standard. This would apply whichever environment you are in.” The NHS also advises to clean parts of the house where germs are more likely to spread using soap and hot water or a disinfectant.

Sophie Biddle, , revealed she is fit and well in a welcome piece of good news amid the pandemic gloom. She was in her second trimester when she was diagnosed four weeks ago. Sophie even felt her baby kick for the first time while in self-isolation. Fortunately her symptoms were mild. After two weeks in isolation, she has been given the all-clear toto her job as an NHS physiotherapist. That means she will soon be treating patients in the community who are themselves recovering from wretched Covid-. Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blog Sophie had her -week scan last Monday and it revealed she is expecting a healthy baby boy. Speaking out to other expectant mums – like Carrie Symonds, who is self-isolating after her PM fiancé Boris Johnson got the virus – Sophie said: “I’ve had a lot of messages from pregnant women worried about the virus. “So, while everyone is dferent, I want people to know that I recovered quickly. The NHS were brilliant and I’m really proud to work with them. “I’m going to be treating patients who are recovering from Covid-. “I’m probably one of the safest people to be around now!”  Sophie, from Chelmsford in Essex, began experiencing mild symptoms of the virus in late February when her partner ed from Milan. The city has been under lockdown for weeks as badly-hit Italy struggles to contain the virus. But Sophie thinks it’s equally possible she could have picked up the illness on her crowded commute to London. She said: “I had a cough, a runny nose and a headache, and took three days off work. Then my partner developed symptoms – he was slightly feverish and chesty.  “We rang  purely because of my partner’s travel history and then things really kicked off. “We were told to drive to AE and sit outside with our hazard lights on and stay in the car, where a nurse in a hazmat suit posted nasal swabs through the car window.” Sophie and her partner were sent home to self-isolate. But medics told them to sleep in separate rooms as they were unsurethey had built up immunity – and were worried they could reinfect each other. By this point, Sophie had started to feel better. She kept herself fit by doing ballet barre-style exercises in her isolation room. On March  she got a call from Public Health England to confirm she had tested positive.  Sophie, who has been writing an isolation blog, said: “My first reaction was shock, really. “I said, ‘Are you sure ’ But as my symptoms were mild I knew I’d be okay and they’d have a plan for me.” As the UK was still trying to contain the virus at this point, health officials called Sophie repeatedly. They took names and contact numbers of everyone she had been in recent contact with, and called the hospital where she worked to find out whether anyone  had been ­experiencing symptoms. Sophie went on: “My brother had been visiting from Sweden so they tested him too. “But he didn’t have the virus. Some people were scared when they found out they’d had contact with us. “But once they learned a bit more about the virus they were more understanding. “The whole time I was off work, I had absolutely amazing support from the NHS.” "},{"url":null,"title":"italian man 101 born during","story":"NewsItalian man, , born during Spanish flu survives coronavirus as death toll risesThe deputy mayor of Rimini said a -year-old man, who was born during the Spanish flu, has survived coronavirus.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe heartbreaking ­sight of a box of abandoned ­kittens was the spark ­to a revolution in animal rights. Trainee banker Ingrid Newkirk could not leave the helpless creatures so she took them to a shelter. Her visit to the dank and squalid refuge would change her le – and triggered her crusade to improve the care and welfare of animals. And in March  Ingrid founded the campaign group Peta – People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Its high-profile protests and by backing of glamorous stars who would bare all for the cause has turned it into one of the world’s most ­formidable animal rights’ group.  Big name actresses include Pamela Anderson, Kim Basinger, Gillian Anderson and Eva Mendes have all stripped off for Peta. Its hard-hitting campaigns aimed to show the truth behind industries such as animal-tested products and industrial meat production. Ingrid, now , said: “Politics, sex and conflict always dominates the news. Causes are always struggling to make it on to the news but everyone looks at ­celebrities. Everyone looksthe word naked is there. We seized on those two things.” Some of Peta’s most shocking moments include ex-Baywatch star Anderson’s near naked body labelled like an animal carcass in  and nude Spanish model Elen Rivas opposing bullfighting with spears in her back. Porn star Jenna Jameson ­campaigned for the use of pleather – plastic leather.  Peta’s  “Holocaust on your plate” demo compared factory ­farming to human death camps and caused outrage. Peta has grown into the world’s largest animal rights organisation with . million members and supporters.Ingrid has led from the front having stripped off and been thrown in prison cells for her protests. Softly spoken but steely in her resolve, Ingrid never planned a le of activism. As a child she loved meat and at , living in her native Surrey, even purchased a squirrel fur coat which she thought she looked “fabulous” in. But finding the kittens in Washington DC in  changed all that. She persuaded workers at the shelter to give her a job.  Peta started with like-minded ­people thinking how they could be kinder to animals. Ingrid slowly changed. She ­inspected homes and farms for the shelter and became a vegetarian after seeing a dead piglet. When she saw a dead squirrel and fox, she threw away her fur coat and fox pelt collar. She said: “My boyfriend sent me a roast chicken when I became vegetarian, knowing I wouldn’t be able to resist the smell. I had to sit him down and tell him ‘I love meat and don’t want to give it up so you have to support me to do this’. He was humbled.”  Peta attracted worldwide ­attention after its first campaign which exposed the treatment of  wild-born macaque monkeys from the Philippines being kept in the Institute for Behavioural Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, US. Peta has legions of ­supporters but Ingrid herself has been the star of many campaigns, including its call to strip off: “I’d ­rather go naked than wear fur.” She said: “When I strip off I’m always a bit knock kneed, it’s often cold just wearing ­knickers. You are like Lady Goa,not as ­attractive, ­doing something to make people think twice about animal cruelty.”  Ingrid has also hung topless from a butcher’s hook beside headless pigs in , broken into the US Vogue offices been thrown in the New York cells with rock star Chrissie Hynde after demonstrating in a Gap store in Manhattan. She said: “With the pig ­campaign, the butchers were there, the carcass cutters were there and they all came out to have a look at me. “I wanted them to look. They are the ones that cut the heads off the pig. My body is the same colour as the pigs’. The only dference was I still had my head on. They came out to mock but ended up quite quiet.”  Peta’s campaigns achieved changes in the fashion industry’s attitude to fur. Designers ­including Victoria Beckham, Prada and Chanel banned it from their runways. Ingrid, who lives in Washington DC, won’t even let death stop her campaigning. After narrowly surviving a light aircraft flight she made provisions for her corpse to be of use. She said: “My liver will go to France to protest the force feeding of ducks and geese for foie gras. I want a leg made into an umbrella stand because elephant’s legs are made into knick-knacks. I want part of my flesh to be cooked with ­onions and garlic and people to be told that it’s human flesh – what dference does it make ” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather met office forecasts","story":"NewsUK weather: Met Office forecasts end to sunny weather with snow and hail on cardsThe weather in the UK at the start of next week is set to be much cloudier than the last few days with patches of rain while temperatures remain cold after plummeting this weekendShareCommentsByJeremy Culley:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video met-office-snow-hit-parts-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-weather-met-office-forecasts-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The country has enjoyed a glorious few days of sunshine since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed on Monday.But temperatures were set to plummet overnight on Saturday to as low as -C and cloudier, more unsettled weather will take hold next week. Temperatures by day on Sunday will struggle to reach double digits, with a keen northeasterly wind making it feel colder. There will be a risk of hail and snow along eastern coasts and inland, although these will become more confined to high ground in the north later in the day. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Dan Suri says “It will stay drier and brighter where, even so, it will be a marked change from the  or  Celsius we have been seeing in a few spots this week.This cold, bright weather is due mainly to a high-pressure system that is developing to the west of the UK, which will bring cold air down from the north. The weather is set to be mostly dry next week, but showers will hit intermittently, some of them heavy. Today: Western parts dry with sunny spells. Wintry showers affecting central and eastern areas, heaviest in the southeast. Windy for many, especially in the south, and feeling cold. Tonight: Often cloudy across northern, central and eastern parts, still with a few showers. Skies clearest in the west where a frost is likely. Remaining breezy.

Mr Markle is still hoping they will reverse their decision to give up their roles as full-time royals.In an exclusive interview, Thomas told the Sunday Mirror: “I think Meghan and Harry should go back to the Royal family in the UK and be supportive of the Queen.“I think they should be in England at this time and not in LA.” He added: “I really support the idea of them going back to the royal family. “They can join the A-list and make lots of money, of course, when the problem with the virus is over. “But they will never find the respect they would have as full members of the royal family.” The retired Hollywood lighting director sent his best wishes to both the Queen and Prince Charles, who is in self-isolation after contracting Covid-.  He revealed Meghan has still not contacted him, despite him being at high-risk of the virus due to his heart condition. He again begged her and Harry for forgiveness and said he hopes the pandemic will remind them what is important in le. And he admitted he is worried Meghan could now be struck down by the virus, which is raging in Calornia, where she and Harry set up in their new home earlier this month, just days before President Trump implemented a travel ban.  Thomas said: “I am in the high risk category, but now a number of young people are also coming down with it. “If I could say anything to Harry and Meghan right now it is that le is too short. “I would certainly tell them to be careful and I would tell them that I love them. “This is the time to think about what is really important in le - it’s too short and unpredictable. “While we have to isolate physically, there is no reason to isolate personally from each other at this time.”  Thomas is at high-risk of contracting coronavirus due to his age and a string of underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, hypertension and prediabetes. He hasn’t spoken to Meghan since he missed her wedding to Harry after suffering a heart attack in May . They fell out shortly before the ceremony after it emerged he had collaborated with a paparazzi photographer to make money from staged photos. And he has yet to meet his son-in-law or grandson Archie,  months.  Thomas is desperately hoping Harry, , will see anyone can make a mistake after he was duped by Russian pranksters impersonating eco-activist Greta Thunburg and her dad Svante. The Prince was duped in two phone calls with notorious jokers Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, during which he indiscreetly told them he is “completely separate” from most of the Royal Family and spoke openly about his agony over “Megxit”.He also opened up to the fake Greta about the tension at the heart of the Royal Family and was also critical of US president Donald Trump. Mr Markle said: “We all think we do something right and it turns out to be wrong. “Harry recently made a huge mistake talking to those Russian pranksters. “He got tricked by those pranksters and I got tricked by doing those photos.  “We all make mistakes and I made a huge mistake. “I should forgive them and they should forgive me. “Ultimately, maybe it’s time for Archie to say hello to grandpa.”  Thomas lives alone in Rosarito, Mexico, just over the border from Calornia, which is now in Covid- lockdown. He has been suffering from a cold for the last two months, but insists it is not coronavirus.  He is now preparing to go into self-isolation in Mexico. He said: “I have a good supply of food in, I’m ready to self-isolate and stay at home. I have more than enough food and water.” Thomas is now preparing to be a witness in the legal battle over a letter Meghan wrote to him detailing her heartbreak at their rt. He originally kept silent about Meghan’s five-page note posted to his home. But six months later its existence was revealed in a US magazine, anonymously quoting fivefriends of Meghan. Thomas felt the nameless pals attacked him and misrepresented the letter, prompting him to take it to a UK newspaper.

Disability advocates say they are aposdisturbedapos by the guidelines published by the state of Alabama on rationing ventilators should the pandemic stretch their resources. New guidance published Alabama officials says that ‘persons with severe mental retardation, advanced dementia or severe traumatic brain injury may be poor candidates for ventilator support.’ It goes on to say that ‘persons with severe or profound mental retardation, moderate to severe dementia, or catastrophic neurological complications such as persistent vegetative state are unlikely candidates for ventilator support.’ Similar guidance has been issued in Washington and Arizona, with medics in the latter state instructed to ‘allocate resources to patients whose need is greater or whose prognosis is more likely to result in a positive outcome with limited resources.’ Disability advocacy groups have filed complaints against the US Department of Health and Human Servicesfor further clarication on the guidance. They are are seeking assurances that disabled people will not be discriminated against when it comes to receiving emergency care.  Those same groups say many of the million Americans who live with such disabilities are already at higher risk of Covid- because they often live in group homes – a known hotspot for deadly outbreaks of the virus. HHS spokesman Roger Severino has insisted that US civil rights laws ‘protect the equal dignity of every human being from ruthless utilitarianism,’ but experts have questioned whether those laws will still be applied during a nationwide medical crisis. Ari Ne’erman, a scholar at the Lurie Institiute for Disability Policy at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, said: What we’re seeing here is a clash between disability rights law and ruthless utilitarian logic. What this is really about at the end of the day is whether our civil-rights laws still apply in a pandemic. I think that’s a pretty core question as to who we are as a country.  News website Tuscon also highlighted the tragic death of Emily Wallace, a  year-old woman with Downaposs syndrome who was infected with Covid- at her Georgia care home, and later died. Wallace previously hit the headlines after she and husband Richard became the first couple with Downaposs syndrome in Georgia to marry, with the pair living happily until Richard’s death in . She then moved into a care home, where she was infected by a care worker who had previously caught the virus.

Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

Based on a hillside, looking down towards Kilchurn Castle, the Tigh Mor project has been developed over several years and has included many volunteers, including primary school pupils.The project has shown evidence of rural le in the th and th-centuries and has clearly demonstrated how archaeology can bring people of all ages together to help develop a site and create a wider interest in their local heritage.The next meeting will be held at .pm on Tuesday March , in the Nicoll Hall.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility.

The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

Some  world leaders, , delegates and thousands of journalists are due to descend on Scotland for the United Nations summit.But the virus has so far infected more than half a million people across  countries.The death toll has already passed ,. Over spring and summer, preparations for COP ndash the th Conference of the Parties ndash are due to intensy, but serious questionmarks have arisen over whether any country affected by Covid- could possibly devote the time and energy needed to prepare for it.Moreover, the logistics of physically transporting world leaders and thousands of other people from hundreds of countries when the airline industry looks likely to be severely damaged by the pandemic appear extremely dficult,not impossible.While the option of video-conferencing COP has been mooted in some parts, officials suggest the Government would be opposed to this. Any such move would deprive Glasgow and the central belt of Scotland of an economic boost that could top pound million.Nor is there any question still within Government that Glasgow should continue to be the host city now that dficulties between the administrations in London and Edinburgh appear to have been ironed out.The Scotland summit is seen as immensely important following the plans agreed at COP in Paris in .Given the fires and floods that have affected many parts of the world in the past  months, the UK Government is hoping that other countries will follow its lead in pledging to hit net-zero carbon emissions by .Last week, Dominic Raab, the UK Foreign Secretary, explained that whether or not the climate change summit could be held in the autumn would depend on the ldquotrajectory of the Covid- outbreak over the coming weeks.However, he clearly signalled to MPs that COP taking place in eight monthsrsquo time was in jeopardy, saying, when askedit could still go ahead: ldquoI canrsquot give you a castiron guarantee things are moving so quickly.ldquoObviously, it is not until November. We will keep it under close review.We would, of course, want it to go ahead but I canrsquot give you any guarantee on that.During Scottish Questions in the Commons, Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, also raised a caveat about the summit taking place this year when he told MPs: ldquoCovid- willing, we will have COP, which will be not only a showcase for Britainrsquos commitment to climate change but a wonderful opportunity for the world to come together whenterrible virus.However, Mr Blackford believes it is now just a matter of time before Boris Johnson formally announces a postponement.Askedthe climate change could go ahead in November, the party leader said: ldquoI donrsquot think it can.

I appreciate learning and taking advice from those who have responsibility for the part of the UK in which I live, who speak to me in plain language, understand the geography and take an approach that fits our stage in the pandemic.The decision to set up a Scottish expert group will pay idends in the coming weeks, recognising that ying approaches will be needed in dferent parts of Scotland . One-size-fits-all is simply not the right approach here. On STV on Thursday evening a woman asked the First Minister for a stronger focus on mental health during this crisis. At Fridayrsquos lunchtime briefing the First Minister announced additional funding for mental health and additional advice on the NHS Scotland website. This is exactly what a nimble government should be capable of doing and illustrates my point precisely.While commendable, I fear that the call for volunteers on the scale of NHS England could well prove too cumbersome to move quickly and may grind under its own inertia. The Scottish Government has indicated that it will support health boards in running their own volunteer networks. Having had some experience in drafting a Bird Flu pandemic plan in  I can say that this approach fits well with the already-established volunteer networks within each local authority area.On the other hand I agree with the views of Nick Kempeand would similarly cite Taiwan, which to date has had  confirmed cases and only two deaths in a population of . million. I note that its government feels that it is past the worst in this wave. It had learned a great deal from SARS, so it traced and tested those who had travelled from mainland China in the three weeks prior to its first case and followed up by checking those partiesrsquo contacts. There is widespread testing. As a matter of routine since SARS, school and college classes are photographed to be able to trace those who are closest to infected persons should there be an epidemic and they are confined. At the time of the first reports from China those arriving in the country were quarantined for  days. We might object to the state enforcing our movements through mobile phones and merging medical and travel records but, on many other aspects, Taiwan can illustrate the effectiveness of how they have handled this.Your headline mentions a judicial review and I am sure that in time it will be clear that the UK should have closed down much earlier.John C Hutchison, Fort William.IF I may add to your report of shortcomings in the British governments attempts to obtain an adequate supply of hospital ventilators , according toIndustrial Development Authority as reported recently in the Irish media, about half of the ventilators manufactured in the world are made in Ireland, mainly by Medtronic of Galway.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Online therapy part of pound.m of mental health fundingDuring the present Coronavirus crisis the EU is restricting the export of certain kinds of medical devices, a restriction from which the UK is exempt unti the end of the transition period of leaving the EU ndash that is, December .

The event was the first organised, non-stop race around the world for iniduals. Those attempting to make the journey had little understanding of how the experience would pan out or how their minds would cope with a year in isolation.The only sailor to complete and therefore win this first feat was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who crossed the finish line after  days alone at sea. Knox-Johnston once said: ldquoYou donrsquot really knowyour brain will stay sane. Your sense of humour is absolutely essential.Now a sailing legend, Knox-Johnston founded the famed Clipper Yacht Race, an event he started so that everyone who wanted it ldquocould have the opportunity to experience the challenge and sheer exhilaration of ocean racing.Sir Robin spoke on the current pandemic on his Twitter feed stating: ldquoBack from the Philippines, the crews now home and the boats sitting for the next - months by which time we hope this virus will be history.\"Now in self-imposed isolation for which my past has trained me perfectly.

An endurance test for the mind to adapt in an ever-changing and high-risk environment.As the power and effect of the pandemic takes hold of the world, the constant change of climate and influx of data leads for new adaptions every day. This is an environment not dissimilar to the challenges faced by iniduals who take on these solo excursions.As a marine marketing agency, Gordon Ritchie, director of GRM Marketing, continues: ldquoDealing with offshore yacht racing and rowing can bring out the best in you.

With businesses facing collapse, iniduals facing job losses and with millions now confined to their homes, this pandemic is predicted to move from a physical crisis to a mental one.The anticipation of lockdown and self-isolation has been the anxiety-inducing issue facing iniduals worldwide as we adapt to this new normal. It will take a period of adjustment, but as in all situations and challenges we adapt, and can in time prosper.As serving submariners in the Royal Navy, HMS Oardacious shared their unique insight on self-isolation when embarking on the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.Lieutenant Hugo Mitchell-Heggs explained: ldquoAs a Royal Navy submariner we are well versed with spending extended periods of time deployed, isolated from society, our loved ones and what most would consider home comforts.He continued: ldquoSettling into a routine and being creative is fundamental to onersquos own wellbeing. Itrsquos never easy settling into a new pattern, and even for submariners, the first week at sea is often the most challenging.\"We also observed this on our ocean row, adapting to each other and our teamrsquos dynamic, to our new diet, safety culture and challenging environment. Twenty-foot waves and gale-force winds from day one was challenging, but with the right mindset we adapted and found ways to not just survive but also thrive.\"The benefits of a routine, and building things to look forward to in your day are a fundamental tactic for maintaining motivation and positivity while self-isolating.\"He said the value of a routine was that it \"provides structure to the working day, to the week and to the whole deployment patrol which can often go on for months on end\".\"Nutrition, exercise and mental stimulation are fundamental to thriving. During the ocean crossing, physical stimulation was aplentybut keeping our mental stimulation took being both creative and adaptable: audiobooks, podcasts, Christmas day karaokeand most importantly, conversation with our crew mates ndash whether it was jokes, banter or a lsquodeep and meaningfulrsquo while rowing under a moonlit sky.Upon speaking to Mitchell-Heggs and taking time to reflect, it becomes clear that in this period of crisis, we as a society have found great dficulty in the removal of the freedom to see those that we look forward to seeing, or the cancellation of events we look forward to experiencing. Holidays were the first to go, then events and gigs, now seeing friends and loved ones. What we now need to do is to find things in a simple day routine to look forward to.Your evening meal, your FaceTime to a friend, your weekly trip to the grocery store. Like the submariners who look forward to their short slot in the gym, or their two-minute shower, happiness, contentment and in the extreme, sanity, are found in the simplest of tasks. The tasks we, on a day-to-day, take advantage of being able to do.Nicola Sturgeon explains of these unprecedented restrictions ldquole shouldnrsquot feel normal right now. Soyour le still feels entirely normal, ask yourselfyou are doing the right things. Every time you think about meeting up with, or coming into physical contact with other people, ask yourselfit is entirely necessary\".What also becomes apparent when discussing isolation and its mental challenges are the importance of the snippets of communication and information that keep spirits up when iniduals are miles from the coast or deep beneath the sea.Finding a source of creativity, communicating, staying active is key to survival, as is remaining positive and having a laugh.Though being at sea adds in a whole number of dangers, the general population today faces saying goodbye to their loved ones with no foreseeable end in sight. The concept of self-isolation, a once-unfamiliar term to the masses, has now become every inidualrsquos reality.In the coming months, we will see the effects of this new \"self-isolation\" and begin to understand the trials that sailors, rowers and explorers endure when taking on challenges that disconnect them physically from the outside world.Gordon Ritchie continues: ldquoIn the light of the Covid- outbreak we should consider that we are now at the start line and all we have to do is complete the challenge and get to the finish line.\"The common outcome is that everyone will have gained a lot from the journey, and be in a much better place when the champagne is uncorked.In this time, it is worthwhile to challenge yourself, try something new, learn something, donrsquot stagnate.\"If we can do it isolated in the middle of an ocean, anyone can do it from the luxurious comfort of their homes and with that constant connectivity, muses Lieutenant Mitchell-Heggs.How to beat isolation, by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston\"Isolation can be incredibly frustrating. But it does not have to be.\"People ask how did I manage  days alone at sea, but the answer is that I was constantly busy. I had a boat to sail, navigate , maintain, steer, plus feed myself. But in that lies the answer, create a project to focus the mind and pass the time.\"If you are a yachtsman, you can learn and practice your knots, or how to throw a line ashore. If you are a landsman, well those knots are always useful.\"Bear in mind I had no one to talk with. No communications at all for most of the time, so I had to think of things that would keep me mentally stimulated. I took to learning poetry. We have wonderful poetry in the English language, but anything that makes the mind work is good.\"Now many of us are staying at home with time on our hands, we could put the time to good use. It might amuse children as well.\"Knots are something many of us use daily so why not practice them, and learn a few new ones  It will keep those skills you have learned fresh for when you can get outside and for my Clipper Race Crew ndash when you re-join your boats next year.\"You have probably seen lines thrown from a boat that donrsquot cover the distance, or get tangled on their way. I suggest you go out into the garden with a rope and practice to develop this skill. A quick tip is to make two coils, not too large, and throw the smaller one allowing the larger one to unravel as the first one extends.\"Isolation is something we are going to have to get used to for the next few weeks. I had  days of it, but I had plenty to do during that period which made the time pass reasonably quickly. So there is the answer. Create a project to fill the time.\"I cannot get over to my boats where there is always something to do, so the garden furniture is getting sanded and re-painted and then I will have to face up to the long put-off job of sorting out everything in my Man Cave, apart from sorting out our new Clipper Race schedule, of course.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mps-foreign-secretarys-incompetence-cost-abandoned-scots-lives","story":"SNP MPs Alyn Smith and Stewart McDonald have lashed out at the minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeafter receiving hundreds of emails and calls from their constituents who cannot get home.Years of budget cuts and no comprehensive plan has left the UK Government playing catch-up with other countries such as Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Israel in its attempts to repatriate, the MPs claim.:Dont bring your virus here, Gringos: Scots stuck abroad face escalating tensions as they wait for help to get homeThey are now calling for the army to be used to bring people home, and sayswt action is not taken it could cost lives as the coronavirus pandemic worsens.Speaking to The Herald on Sunday, Stewart McDonald challenged Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to ldquopull his finger out, while berating airlines trying to ldquomake a fast buck out of abandoned tourists.The Glasgow South MP said: ldquoDominic Raab is showing that he is way out of his depth and it is our constituents who are paying the price for it.ldquoForeign Office Officials advising Members of Parliament to tell their constituents to crowd-fund or try and raise bank loans in order to get home safely during a global health pandemic is about as contemptible as you can get.ldquoThe Foreign Secretary needs to pull his finger out and start a global effort to bring our citizens home.ldquoPeople are being left with little or no money, are running out of critical medicine and in some cases are being left with no accommodation in the country they are visiting.ldquoThe airline industry, many of whom are doing their best to raise a fast buck and want to charge people eye-watering amounts tohome, are proving useless and ought to be ashamed of the way they are trying to extort travellers for money during a global health crisis.McDonald, the SNPrsquos Defence spokesman added that Raab should be using the Ministry of Defenceldquoto ensure that the armed forces ndash logistically well prepared around the world ndash start non-combatant evacuation operations for UK citizens and dual nationals stranded abroad.Should the MoD be utilised in the effort, no additional legislation would be needed as there are already measures in place for non-combatant evacuations.The MP said: ldquoDominic Raabrsquos dither and delay has the potential to cost lives. He needs to pull his finger out and act now.Alyn Smith, MP for Stirling, wrote to Raab on Friday after numerous desperate Scots contacted him for help.He has now accused the Foreign Office of ldquocompletely failing Scots, and said the UKrsquos attempt at repatriation has been woeful in comparison to other countries.The SNPrsquos foreign affairs spokesman said he was ldquofurious at the lack of action to bring people back home, adding: \"Enough is enough, the UK has let our constituents down.ldquoThis has simply not been taken seriously and the FCO is clearly not coping.:Iain Macwhirter on coronavirus: this crisis could bring a Great Depression, not socialism\"The FCO has borne the brunt of years of budget cuts and this sorry state of affairs is the result, I know many FCO officials share my frustration that they are trying to achieve miracles but are overwhelmed.ldquoWeve heard great tell of the broad shoulders of the UK. Well theres plenty of Scots stuck abroad right now who have been comprehensively let down.ldquoIt reflects particularly badly when contrasted with other countries.Smith said the images of hundreds of commercial planes grounded at airports, and staff being put on furlough leave, has made it even more galling for the thousands of Scots stuck abroad.He said: ldquoIt is obvious that there is capacity to organise evacuation flights, just a lack of political will.\"This is not just that people are being inconvenienced, it is an emergency.ldquoI, like many MPs, have heard heartbreaking stories over the last few weeks of people who are stuck having tried every option to get home but have been let down by airlines of people running out of medicine, or money having been let down by their insurance company as well.\"The state needs to step in. We have seen welcome action in some isolated cases but there needs to be a comprehensive plan to get out people home. We will of course need to work out quarantine for when they get back but first and foremost we need to let people know theyre not on their own.\"An FCO spokesman said: \"We recognise British tourists abroad are finding it dficult toto the UK because of the unprecedented international travel and domestic restrictions that are being introduced around the world ndash often with very little or no notice.ldquoThe FCO is working around the clock to support British travellers in this situation to allow them to come back to the UK.

In our local, the drams are so tiny that just inhaling the aroma of your whisky drains the glass.However, during the current crisis , folk have been pining for the pub. So much so that theyrsquore creating ldquovirtual pubs where they can talk to their mates about the football, make several marriage proposals, and sing like a lintie to the despair of all others present.The influential Daily Star newspaper called it ldquooff your facetime, and quoted expert opinion that home drinking will rise from  million pints a week to m during the pubs shutdown. Newspaper pictures show empty shelves in supermarket drinks aisles, and proclaim that booze is the new bog roll.Naturally, as someone whose normal modus operandi is social isolation , I wonrsquot be joining any virtual pubs. Irsquom not even sure how the phenomenon works. Something to do with video-conferencing via apps on your portable telephones. Such a lot of nonsense.But I will own that the pub is a central part of British le. In its convivial sense, it used to be the case that this applied more to England, where therersquos always been more of a lad culture, but where women also could enjoy themselves within reason.Scottish pubs in the old days, by contrast, were pale and dour places. They were places of shame and guilt, disreputable establishments for the fallen ndash solitary, troubled souls who stared morosely at the gantry for hours on end, lamenting lost loves and le in general.I think thatrsquos changed recently, and English friends often comment on how how ldquolively they find Scottish pubs. Theyrsquore full of craic. Wersquove all become a little bit more Irish in that sense, and thatrsquos no bad thing.But, even so, the pub is rarely what itrsquos craicked up to be. Therersquos no rollicking piano in the corner. If you go in on your own, no one will speak to you. If you try speaking to a lady nowadays, she will alert the constabulary and have you arrested for hate speech.At least in your own house, you can say what you like. Or, failing that, you can just stare at the bottle, lamenting lost loves and le in general.Rural racketHERErsquoS an odd thing you learn only through experience.

Where itrsquos going and why is anybodyrsquos guess. And thatrsquos before you come to farmers ndash industrialisers of the country ndash and their ious infernal machines.Compare and contrast with a nice quiet flat in the city. With no gardens, sheds, DIY workshops or farms nearby, yoursquove no local loci for racket. You may even live furth of traffic. What bliss.PG Wodehouse has his witless urban characters frequently bemoaning countryside racket. But, writing before the age of electronic DIY equipment and horticultural artillery, he was referring mainly to birdsong, which I adore. In the garden, Irsquom uneasy when, for some reason, therersquos none.Birdsong isnrsquot at the same psyche-destroying pitch as DIY ordnance. Neither is it rhythmic.

The first death outside of America was in Scotland. In fact, it was at Paisleyrsquos Royal Alexandra Hospital ndash a young woman who had recently given birth. Eventually the pandemic would officially claim  Scottish lives. Few doubt the real figure was actually much higher.Fear gripped the UK ndash and Scotland in particular ndash as public health colleagues were thrown into round-the-clock emergency mode with dedicated flu jab vaccine clinics hurriedly set up to keep potential carriers of the virus away from GP surgeries and other health facilities normally used for the flu jab.There was a shortage of the vaccine and there was a clamour to get protected ndash there was also huge concern over the lack of knowledge about how to best use and deploy PPE . The emergency departments of our hospitals were revealed as wanting in their ability to prepare and deliver fit-for-purpose pandemic handling strategies. Ambulance crews complained of exposure without appropriate PPE.Eventually it all calmed down and went away, and public attention moved to fresh topics. The daily norm of short-termism, political sparring for short-term gain and the creation of headlines that momentarily seem hugely important regained pole position as the stale staple diet of Scotland, the UK, Europe, and the world.But in the world of public health protection the experts knew nothing had really changed. That our brushes with avian flu in  and swine flu in were just tasters of what would inevitably come to bite our proverbial butts.I remember one of the most respected public health consultants in Scotland ndash Dr Syed Ahmed ndash addressing health board seminars and presenting with absolute certainty the evidence that predicted a far more signicant influenza pandemic would strike ndash notbut when ndash and that the death toll would be enormous.The scientic evidence was overwhelming, and he and other experts at the World Health Organisation and public health epidemiologists around the world were in absolutely no doubt it would happen ndash ldquothis year, next year, in a few years ... we donrsquot know which year but we do know it will happen.Now, with time to reflect on things past and present, I sit in my converted garage office and wonder how it is that so many people in power, so many policymakers and scientists, influential iniduals and organisations, could have ignored such stark evidence. I wonder how they focused so much on Brexit and income tax levels, and how many immigrant entry points should be given to fruit pickers wanting to enter the UK ... when such matters as preparation for a pandemic were sidelined, and climate change given but a glancing nod from the worldrsquos most powerful nations and leaders.Irsquom not angry.

Mass pandemics were seemingly hundreds of years in the past, although shortly to come. The preoccupation was simply to stay alive.Itrsquos April  in France. The German army has bludgeoned both the French forces and the British Expeditionary Force, the French having lost , men in one day in an earlier battle. Britain too has suffered , casualties ndash nearly half of the British Regular Army. At home German warships have bombarded the coastal towns of Whitby, Hartlepool and Scarborough, killing  people and wounding hundreds more.Aerial warfare is only in its infancy, although Zeppelins have drted over London, dropping bombs on the civilians by hand. Biplanes are rarely seen over the hundreds of miles of trenches, and what would later be called dogfights between combatants mostly involves firing sidearms and rles, although the Germans are beginning to mount machine guns on their planes. Bombing raids involve hurling the ordnance overboard from the cockpit.The aerodrome at Lille, captured by German troops, is peaceful. Itrsquos a bright morning when a single plane is spotted in the sky overhead, a French plane. Therersquos a scurry for arms and then for cover as a large spherical bomb is unleashed. On the ground they watch as it falls to earth, then bounces high in the air before settling on the ground. Itrsquos suspected of having a time delay fuse so no one approaches it for a time.

Fake news amplied.How did all this begin  No one knows for sure. Therersquos an unlikely claim that it started with Chaucer in the th century in the Nunrsquos Priest Tale, which I studied in school and thatrsquos far enough for me. Or, in , when Flemish poet Eduard de Dene wrote about a nobleman who sent his servants on foolish errands on April . Dficult to believe it was just once a year.Shakespeare, in the late s, wrote about fools in his plays but never mentioned an April one, they were all the year round then. There are no references in any English-language texts or diaries or letters. The first British reference is in , when the poet John Aubrey referred to the celebration as \"Fooles holy day.Twelve years later several people were tricked into going to the Tower of London to \"see the Lions washed. That was a truly cruel and class-based one. Why wouldnrsquot someone who had never seen, or barely heard of, a lion want to see that  Now they have stone ones which they probably wash regularly.According to the Museum of Hoaxes ndash clue, there isnrsquot one! ndash the BBCs Panorama programme was the first to televise an April Foolrsquos joke in , and once again it depended on looking down on the viewer. A British audience, then unfamiliar with pasta ndash like today really, when you canrsquot get any in the shops ndash were shown what purported to be spaghetti trees in Switzerland. Oxbridge chortled.In  the Swedes took it a step further. Then, there was only one channel, and in black and white. An \"expert\" demonstrated that by pulling a nylon stocking over the TV the mesh would bend in such a way that it would become colour. No one quite knows how many pairs of stockings were ruined in homes.In  the BBC again caught the more gullible viewers out by running a video clip of flying penguins, claiming the birds were winging to tropical rainforests in South American to escape the harsh Antarctic weather.It wasnrsquot long before companies and advertisers got in on it to punt their products. In , Burger King placed a full-page advert in USA Today for its \"left-handed Whopper\" ndash with all the condiments rotated  degrees especially for left-handed diners. Ikea produced and released a high chair for dogs in . And in  Tesco bounced into the wheeze, promising to introduce trampoline aisles in their stores, to help us reach the top shelves more easily, which would be pointless this year because therersquos nothing on them.In , probably the worlds most famous self-publicist organised his own jape. A flying saucer landed in a field on the outskirts of London. One brave copper brandishing a truncheon tentatively approached it, only to flee when the door opened and a small, silver-suited figure emerged. He was Virginrsquos Richard Branson and it was a hot-air balloon which he probably inflated with his own.At least a dozen countries celebrate April Fools Day, with the \"day of lies\", or dia da mentira, recognised in Brazil. In Belgium, Italy and France itrsquos \"April Fish\" day, Poisson drsquoAvril in French, or pesce daprile in Italian, when children tape fish on peoples backs.In Portugal people throw flour over each other, for reasons known only to other Portuguese, although it provides necessary income for millers.In Scotland, April Fools Day was formerly known as Huntigowk Day ndash gowk being Scottish, of course, for a stumour. People were sent on an errand to deliver a sealed message reading \"Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile\".Nowadays we just nail shoes to floors, stretch cling film over the toilet or superglue mobile phone to refrigerators, although that may just be me. And for some reason the joke here cuts off at noon, which massively reduces the opportunity for malevolence, which is probably good for the over-stretched courts.April Foolrsquos jokes and pranks are out for the media this year, given the gravity of the times.

Residents and guests will enjoy flawless service and first-class leisure facilities, it promised.Said to hold the prospect of creating more than , jobs and injecting millions in the local economy, locals may well have been forgiven for thinking gWest was set to propel the village of Blackford on to the global golf map.But despite the course being designed by leading Scottish golf architect David McLay-Kidd ndash whose courses include the Castle Course at St Andrews ndash and completed in , gWestrsquos greens have been played by only a handful of golfers.Now, after being shrouded in mystery for years, a member of the fabulously rich al-Tajir family has broken the silence to suggest the Scottish independence debate and Brexit turmoil are behind the resort being ldquobunkered.Speaking on BBC podcast The Patch, Mohsin al-Tajir, son of Highland Spring owner Mahdi Mohammed Al Tajir ndash whose fortune is estimated to be at least pound. billion ndash laid blame for what seems to be a decision to mothball the resort, on political issues.ldquoAt the moment Brexit has come along, Scotlandrsquos screaming for independence and the next phase of gWest is another pound, pound, poundm, and as a family wersquore not willing to put that sort of money inwe donrsquot know what the future is, he said.ldquoIf tomorrow Scotland got independence and they decided to turn it into a tax haven like Monaco, wersquod be the first there to put the money in. In fact, wersquod put three or fourcourses in and build another two hotels, he added.ldquoBut the way we are today where it looks like taxation is going to go up, the local councils and local villages are going to control everything around them ... maybe itrsquos not the place I need to put my money. There are better places to put it.Along with his comments about the gWest site was a suggestion that complaints and objections to an extension to the Highland Spring business had had a detrimental impact on the familyrsquos view of the area.ldquoItrsquos like they have this thing they donrsquot like to see successful people, he added. ldquoTheyrsquod much rather hear that he has gone bankrupt rather than he has made money or become big.ldquoWhen we built the extension to Highland Spring, the amount of people that objected ... I was feeding your family for past  years, why would you object  he added. ldquoWhy are you objecting, itrsquos your livelihood for Godrsquos sake.The comments have stung locals in the village of Blackford, which sits at the heart of the Al Tajir familyrsquos estate, and who have watched the area change dramatically.It is claimed that since the golf coursersquos construction, once familiar rights of way are no longer as accessible as they once were.There have been whispered complaints about over-zealous security guards, bulls seemingly deliberately put in fields to deter walkers, and a sense that the land is ldquoout of bounds.ldquoWe have core paths and assorted rights of way across the land but they donrsquot want members of the public going anywhere near it, said one local resident, who asked not to be named. ldquoThere are gates butyou try to walk through, yoursquoll be challenged by a security guard. He will say you have no right to be there, that it could be dangerous.ldquoIf you are building a resort with multi-million-pound homes, you donrsquot want a core path running outside the houses.ldquoIt feels like itrsquos them and us.According to Iain Paton of Blackford Community Council, the ldquoghost golf course has left people wondering what its purpose is,it doesnrsquot have any players.ldquoPeople are mystied, he said. ldquoIt is curious that therersquos a golf club that seems well-maintained but hasnrsquot been used.ldquoThere are rights of way across it, but when people last year tried to exercise their right to cross, they were apparently being chased off.ldquoThere was a security guy there ndash I think lsquointimidatingrsquo is a good word for it.ldquoItrsquos not like the course is surrounded by wire fencing, or that people arenrsquot able to go on it at all. It just not exactly welcoming.Plans for the resort were well under way when the global markets crashed in . That crisis is thought to have led to the vision being reviewed. However, by , plots at the gWest resort were being marketed for sale and businesses offered the chance to play the course.However, political uncertainty caused first by the independence referendum and then Brexit is now said to have put off international investors and led to the development being mothballed.However, local Perthshire and Kinross councillor for Strathallan, Tom Gray, wonderstherersquos another, even harder problem to solve that may be a factor. ldquoThe climate here isnrsquot the best to place for a resort, not unless you want to go fishing or get wet, he says. ldquoThis is Blackford, itrsquos not St Andrews where they can probably play golf all year round. I think yoursquoll find lots of puddles on a course around here.ldquoClimate change is definitely having an impact here. Even in my letime Irsquove seen huge changes. Agriculture has changed ndash this used to be mixed arable and stock rearing area. Now itrsquos too wet for crops.ldquoThere was surprise at how ambitious the plans were for the site. The sums being spent were very large. That took people by surprise. Blackford was never a huge destination. It was just a stopping-off point on the A.For golfers who dream of the next challenge, gWest must feel so close, yet so far away.One of the few people to have struck a ball there is Al Tajir himself. Speaking on the podcast, he said: ldquoI have played gWest  or  times. Itrsquos dferent, itrsquos a modern course. Anything hard, I donrsquot like.As to the future, perhaps all is not lost for golfers hoping to challenge their swing at Scotlandrsquos ldquoghost golf club.ldquoEventually when the economy picks up in Scotland and we can see what is happening in the future, we will develop it properly, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-can-help-make-things-little-better","story":"What a week!

You could say that the applause summed up the massive groundswell of mutual support that has heartened us all in the middle of this awful plague. Volunteering at its heart is the friendly coming together of people, to make a positive contribution. Wersquove all seen this in abundant examples of community spirit, and very challenging it is to do this along with social distancing.How wonderful for us to experience the giving nature of all our citizens and realise that we do have a society based on relationships and looking out for each other. Part of this, of course, is to keep in mind our ldquoDuty of Care. Protecting our selves, ensuring that we donrsquot put anyone in unnecessary risk, and being disciplined about the key aim of staying at home and helping the NHS to cope with the demand to save lives.The UK Government captured the zeitgeist of our willingness to help and the extraordinary ,-plus registration of NHS volunteers for England and Wales only.

While itrsquos heart-warming to see this supply side so keen, whatrsquos the actual demand for peoplersquos service Scotland has taken a more measured approach and has been using the head as well as the heart.From next week readyscotland.org will provide a starting point for anyone that wants to volunteer.This will be a coordinated effort to signpost you to where the needs are now, and also to give the option to get involved at dferent phases of this crisis.Therersquos whatrsquos needed now, with the role of the countryrsquos network of Resilience Partnerships, including local neighbourhood Resilience Hubs where these are in place. Therersquos a mobilisation under way, and I hope to witness a lot more of these hubs over time. Community action is core to this, and East Ayrshire Council and my old boss Fiona Lees is a great example of this.Then therersquos the period of the greatest strain on the NHS and the prospect of directed volunteer assistance for the frontline. Driving, collections, ward support, feeding patients, and doing whatever is necessary under the command of the NHS and the standards required. The British Red Cross will be playing an expert and vital role in matching NHS need to volunteers, and this will be clearly communicated on the Ready Scotland web site.Irsquove been listening to Professor John Ashton, the public heath expert from Liverpool. He said that we can assist the NHS in a major way by helping get patients back home quickly, and this will need home care, from workers and community volunteering, including basic nursing skills. Has our ldquoDuty of Care now dramatically extended into the moral sphere of caring for each other in ways we havenrsquot been thinking about, and is it less about not doing harm and more about generating wellbeing for us all Once we get through this, we then need to focus on recovery. There has not been the same attention paid to this because wersquore caught up with our immediate challenges. However, the greatest potential of volunteering will be at the recovery stage. Most of the countryrsquos volunteers, along with the workforce, are at home just now.Irsquom talking to people about what it might be like at the other end. About regaining our volunteers and associational le. About getting for instance all the walking groups re-started. Health walks. Talking about how wersquore faring and generating the whole spectrum of volunteering le through mutual support, formal service, and civic engagement and campaigning.The Covid- crisis has been likened to a war.

And we will do that for as long as we can.While Heart of Scotstoun is an existing group which has adapted, other groups have sprung up in direct response to the coronavirus.One Facebook group in Edinburgh is trying to connect people in a time of need.Torben Hutchings set up Facebook group Coronavirus Volunteering Edinburgh just over a week ago and has now helped to put in place a connections page.He said: ldquoOur page is all about helping people get the right information and access to information they need right now. It is not about the group giving the advice, but we thought there was a way we could put people in touch with those who could.ldquoMarkus Ronde, Yuchen Shang, Daniel Connell and myself have been working on it, and it has really grown in the past few days to the extent we even have subgroups for specic issues such as access and disability, mental health, entertainment and welfare and, most importantly, the Local Group Locator which links people who are nearby.\"We also set up a survey and a database that volunteers could sign up to, which would allow charities to get in touch with volunteers based on their postcode.ldquoHandling the information of what could be a very large number of people was not something we took lightly, and we had to pause slightly and take stock to prevent setting up a system that might be abused or expose volunteers to undue liability or stress.ldquoWithin a couple of days all social media elements were up and running and working well, and groups were continuing to pop out of the woodwork and connect in to our set up.The group has also had to adapt and respond as advice and guidance changed.Mr Hutchings added: ldquoEdinburgh is a big city and following the declaration of a UK-wide lockdown, we are going to ask people in these groups to limit their inidual volunteering activities to their immediate areas even as close as stairwells and streets. We canrsquot really have people running from one end of town to another when this is all about helping to stop the spread of the virus.Another group which is serving its community is Kinross Kindness in Perth and Kinross and they are thinking outside the box and have even held a virtual coffee morning to bring people together.Founder Tim Mart got the balling rolling and already they have dozens of people in the community offering to help.Mr Mart said: ldquoOur aim is to create a support network of incredible humans to help those needing to or thinking about self-isolation. That through kindness and compassion, they can do so in confidence and in knowing that their community is here to support them.ldquoWe have more than  protecting vulnerable groupschecked volunteers of all ages supporting with phones, pick ups and deliveries. We just held our first virtual community coffee morning with music from the amazing Gillian Strachan, a worker at the local youth group KYTHE ndash Kinross-shire Youth Enterprise.ldquoThe over-arching response from the vulnerable groups in the community has been a feeling of reassurance and confidence that Kinross Kindness exists.ldquoWe also raised pound as part as a slush fund for those that cannot afford essentials at this time.ldquoAlong with the many collections and deliveries we have undertaken, one of the interesting stories this week has been supporting a woman in Canada to arrange shopping for her  year-old grandparents in the Kinross-shire community who have been unable to leave their property.Volunteer Scotland, the body national body for volunteering, said they have seen traffic to their website increase along with the number of inquiries.Alan Stevenson, IT  Communications Manager, Volunteer Scotland, said: \"Wersquore seeing a spike in demand for people looking to volunteer at this time. Its about  times our normal traffic to parts of the site. While our Covid- section includes advice on the ways people can volunteer right now, we also expect this advice to be updated soon in line with the First Ministers announcement mentioning the setting up of a lsquocentral pointrsquo for volunteers to help the NHS and locally.*If you are a volunteer or are running a volunteer group, let us know.

There is, after all, very little to be cheery about when writing about war, famine, pestilence or disease day in, week out ndash the current pandemic being a point in case.That said,you really want to see a misery guts, then look no further than the foreign correspondent unable to dash around the world covering the stories he did up until recently.My long-suffering we, who has grown accustomed, one might even say welcoming, of my often prolonged absences these past many years, has taken to ascribing another epithet to me given my current enforced hiatus.The Victor Meldrew of international reporting, she calls me, adding a new chapter to the imaginary ldquoVictor Diaries she is writing as I daily fit the role of the archetypal grumpy old man from the sitcom One Foot In The Grave. Yesterday saw two new chapters ndash ldquoVictor does pasta and ldquoVictor hates Jeremy Vine.Speaking, however, of real writers, it was the great William Howard Russell, an Irish reporter with The Times, who covered the Crimean War in the s who is often considered as having been one of the first modern war or foreign correspondents. It was also Russell who described those within our profession as a ldquoluckless tribe.Our species, he concluded, verges on the obsessively curious and is part nomad, voyeur and masochist. We are also, he observed, iniably resourceful, prone to being selfish loners and almost always cunning and pushy.Irsquod like to disagree with Russellrsquos character take but I canrsquot. In many respects hersquos bang on the money. Whatrsquos more, so many of these distinguishing traits are ideal in the time of Covid-. Call them war correspondent survival instincts or coping mechanisms.Certainly, from a voyeurrsquos perspective, it means one never tires of watching from my flat window the battles between seagulls and pigeons that now appear to have taken over the streets of Glasgowrsquos Merchant City where we live.The selfish loner bit too comes in especially handy when yoursquore stashed away indoors alongside your ton of bog roll and bottles of gin. Then therersquos the cunning and pushy bit, which is particularly handy during those once-a-day forays out into the no manrsquos land of the pandemic to requisition said bog roll and bottles of gin. Where things do get tough though, and the foreign correspondentrsquos guile and resourcefulness are just not enough, is in making sure that nomadic and storytelling desire is fulfilled.Like the best pub raconteurs you see, foreign correspondents, like most reporters, love the power of the yarn and instinctively know that the quirky or human detail which says ldquoI was there is what makes stories come alive for the audience.All of which got me thinking in these times of self-confinement about the many wonderful places, inspiring people and bizarre experiences Irsquove encountered during almost  years of journeying to locations most people would avoid for good reason.Such adventures, of course, always begin with a journey, something which after the best part of four decades on the hoof I never thought of myself pining for ever again until these self-isolating, self-distancing days.Isolation and distance, after all, are near meaningless to the foreign correspondent. The world of international news coverage is no respecter of standing still, mileage, time or circumstance.I recall once, while on the last days of a holiday in Spain in , getting news of the sudden eruption of a war between Israel and the paramilitary forces of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Within hours of getting home from holiday and with an alternative set of bags packed, complete with body armour and helmet, I headed off almost immediately.Given that Beirut airport was shut down because of Israeli bombing, the journey ended up being somewhat circuitous. Early on, colleagues already in Lebanon had warned me that the banks and ATMs in Beirut were closed and that I should bring all the money I needed for the duration of my stay.Having been in Spain just prior to my departure for the Middle East, including a day trip to Morocco, I had over the course of a week withdrawn cash from ATMs in Tangier, Tara in Spain, Glasgow, London, Vienna, and Damascus in Syria before arriving in Beirut to a telephone call from a rather concerned representative of my bank.ldquoEven by your standards, Mr Pratt, this activity seems quite unusual, he observed, before pausing briefly and asking only half jokingly ndash ldquoAre you on the run So many of such journeys over the years, often to the remotest places, have been memorable and iniably involve flying.Flying, remember that  Already it seems like and age since I last stepped aboard a plane, not that I ever imagined missing air travel. Early in my career I confess to being a little anxious about flying, but later I grew to love it despite some of the crazier moments.Moments like that time in the Democratic Republic of Congowhen I went to cover a story on the legal and illegal gold mining trade that flourishes in some of the remotest bush and jungle territory in this vast resource rich country.For weeks I found myself in the hands of two bush pilots ndash Chris ldquoPeppersteak Laidler and Paddy Hyndman. For the best part of seven years, Laidler and Hyndman had worked as bush pilots flying in and out of one of the continentrsquos most politically volatile areas ndash the Great Lakes region that straddles Uganda, Rwanda and the vastness of northeastern Congo.In that time, Laidler had picked up ndash along with a few furrows on his brow ndash the Peppersteak nickname, because as Hyndman pointed out, it doesnrsquot matter what kind of restaurant he goes to, Thai, Italian or Indian, itrsquos always the same order ndash pepper steak.Young, modern men these aviators might be. But despite their occasional penchant while airborne for listening on their iPods to The Killers, there still seemed something of a pioneering streak in their nature more in tune with the values of a bygone age. A time in history when enormous risk-taking was par for the course in exploring places like Africa, and shrugged off with insouciance and black humour only those confident enough in their own resourcefulness were able to muster.Indeed, many of the pilots I met in Congo might have come from the pages of books like Wind, Sand And Stars by the French writer and aviator-adventurer, Antoine de Saint-Exupery.Northeastern Congo has always looked and felt like the setting for a Boyrsquos Own tale of derring-do. At some of the bigger airstrip towns like Bukavu and Goma, on the banks of Lake Kivu, the runways are flanked by ancient Dakotas and Antonov biplanes of the type any locations researcher for Raiders Of The Lost Ark would have died for.And speaking of Indian Jones-type moments, I all too vividly recall one take-off when a wall of jungle came hurtling towards us at a terrying speed. Not for the first time I could feel myself willing the plane into the air. ldquoUp, up, I heard the voice inside my head saying, as my body involuntarily bobbed up and down in the seat like a demented African meerkat.It wasnrsquot just the roughness of the rutted dirt runway that was making me bounce. It was the desperate psychological urge to help propel our take-off safely over the trees into the humid air that hung like a saturated canopy above the rainforest.Having cleared the tops with barely feet to spare, the aircraft suddenly banked so steeply that the horizon became virtually vertical and I felt my stomach lurch as gravity tugged at my insides. Just as I was reassuring myself that the worst was almost over, the fuselage door at the back of the plane suddenly flew open, sending a deafening blast of air into the cabin. So powerful was it, that the heavy industrial harnesses used to hold the cargo of highly inflammable fuel drums we were carrying on board fluttered like celebratory bunting.Next to me, our only ldquoofficial passenger ndash a Congolese gold mining engineer ndash was anything but celebratory. Having clamped his hands instinctively to the armrests of his seat, his eyes were full of fear and looked ready to pop out of his head.Glancing anxiously towards the cockpit, it slowly dawned on me that the planersquos co-pilot, Paddy Hyndman, was actually gesturing at us to try and shut the hatch through which the Congolese jungle could be seen sweeping past a few hundred feet below.He had to be kidding. Already this was all getting a bit too Indiana Jones for my liking. Shamefully, I decide to remain seated and watched as my indomitable cameraman colleague, buffeted by the wind, edged his way back up the aircraft, before getting his shoulder behind the door and heaving it shut. Not surprisingly, the experience was enough to leave lesser mortals like my fellow passengers and me on the edge of mental meltdown. For Chris and Paddy, however, who sat grinning in the cockpit, it was all just another day at the office.Right now itrsquos adventures like this that I yearn for, well sort of. Just as I miss the travel and freedom to move as we all do, so too do I miss engaging with myriad characters, soldiers, refugees, warlords, aid workers, and perhaps most importantly of all, ordinary civilians from around the world.Itrsquos strangely reassuring right now to think of all those people and places Irsquove encountered over the years. The remarkable indigenous Embera people of the rainforests of Colombia, for example, who I spent time with in their remote communities flanking the Rio Andagueda or ldquoRiver of Butterflies as it is known. For them, isolation is something they desire. Nothing makes them happier than being away from the destructive intrusion of an outside world that brings with it the illegal mining that threatens a way of le close to nature they have nurtured for centuries.ldquoWhen we remember our ancestors, we can see the future, one Embera man told me when asked what he thought the years ahead held for his people. There is a lesson there for us all in these strange times.Like so many people in remote and often dficult places, the hospitality of the Embera was a joy to behold. Hospitality and humour, these are the qualities I think most about just now when Irsquom reflecting on my travels. I once recall ndash for a joke ndash having my photograph taken alongside a village chief in South Sudan. He was the tallest man Irsquod ever seen and made the average basketball player look diminutive.Short as I am, even standing next to him on a wall the best part of two feet high, he still towered above me. The hilarity of the entire village, especially the children, was infectious and left us all in bouts of uncontrollable laughter. It was a simple but marvellously wonderful instant of common humanity.Over the years Irsquove talked with voodoo priests and artists in Haiti, danced the gazumba with young Angolans in a basement bar in Huambo, and been caught trying to illegally cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, disguised as a woman dressed in a burka and sandals complete with painted toenails.Irsquove eaten sheep brain masala in a ldquorestaurant in the Khyber bazaar and guzzled beer through a gas-mask nozzle at an ldquoApocalypse Party in a Tel Aviv nightclub, as Iraqi missiles fell on the city. These are the rich, warming and sublimely odd experiences that for the moment I miss.I still have that gas mask, which only makes an occasional appearance now when I want to play the role of ldquoalien and terry the children of visiting friends and relations. Come to think of it, though, now might be a good time to wear it while making those occasional forays for the bog roll and bottles of gin.Yes, folks, what you have just been reading has not been my usual look at the world. But I still remain that ldquointernational man of misery,only because like so many of us Irsquom missing the rich ersity of the world we so took for granted. I canrsquot wait to get back on the road.Yours sincerely hellip a frustrated foreign correspondent."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-help-people-useful-numbers-stay-safe","story":"Follow Government advice to protect yourselves and others ndash stay at home unless essential to leave.You should only leave the house for one of four reasons:If you need medical help for any reason, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.If you have symptoms of coronavirus , use the  coronavirus service.If you need help or advice not related to coronavirus::Coronavirus: seven video games to play during lockdownAge Scotland www.ageuk.org.uk scotlandTelephone Age Scotland Helpline   Health guidance for pregnant women and maternity professionals looking after them has been produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.www.rcog.org.uk en guidelines-research-services guidelines coronavirus-pregnancy covid--virus-infection-and-pregnancy Guidance is also available as part of the general QA on the NHS Inform website www.nhsinform.scot illnesses-and-conditions infections-and-poisoning coronavirus-covid-#common-questionsDisability Information Scotland runs a helpline and hosts useful information.www.disabilityscot.org.uk Citizens Advice Scotland www.citizensadvice.org.uk scotland health coronavirus-what-it-means-for-you Skills Development Scotland www.citizensadvice.org.uk scotland health coronavirus-what-it-means-for-you The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service hwww.acas.org.uk adviceStepChange www.stepchange.org debt-info debt-and-coronavirus.aspxNational Debtline www.nationaldebtline.org EW factsheets Pages coronavirus-advice-and-support help-and-advice.aspxSamaritans Scotland offers a -hour Freephone helpline plus an email support service www.samaritans.org  or call on  Check the Scottish Association for Mental Health www.samh.org.ukHelp and advice, including about funding, is available from SCVOrsquos Covid- Third Sector Information Hub.scvo.org.uk support coronavirusThe Scottish Commission for People with Learning Disabilities provides links to useful easy-read resources on Coronavirus www.scld.org.uk Enable Scotland offers support for people with learning disabilities as well as a helpline www.enable.org.uk coronavirus-information Alzheimers Scotland www.alzscot.org living-with-dementia getting-support -hour-freephone-dementia-helplinehelpline@alzscot.org ndash   There are other ways you can contribute to the national response to coronavirus.

Her sister Tracey joined the enterprise last year. Four people work for the business altogether.Despite the uncertainty, she is determined to hang on, despite having had to suspend work because of the lockdown. She is also anxious to protect her clients and her two young daughters.“Things are kind of tricky at the moment. They’ve come out with a package saying they will help, but as far as I’m aware it’ll not be available until June,# she said.“I was relieved there was going to be something in place, but by June I don’t kenI’ll still be able to trade. It’s very up in the air at the moment.”Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. Ms Leith said she was unable to work because most of her clients were senior citizens, “and I’m not classed as an essential worker”.“I’ve had to down tools to protect all of my elderly clients, and the lasses.”She has noticed a certain irony in having to cancel cleaning jobs at a time when cleaning is considered to be important in order to hold the virus off.“Once the lockdown had come everybody said ‘wait until the lockdown is over’ and we’ll reschedule the clean. Weirdly, the cleaning has dried up and that’s most important.”Ms Leith said she was avoiding news bulletins after becoming so concerned about the pandemic. But she said she was determined to hold on until June when her business may get the support it needs from the government.“I’m positive we will,” she said. “There are some days where I think we won’t, but I’m trying to stay positive.”Meanwhile a taxi driver, who did not wish to be named, said he had been able to secure Universal Credit, which he believed that would cover rent and council tax, but very little . His business, he said, had been able to stay open “but it is really what you might call bread and milk money”.The driver added he was not hopeful about the new support being offered, and added he had taken out a finance package on a new car in January, before adding the economic downfall could not have happened at a worse time.Painter and decorator Fearghas Noblett was dwelling on the positives.

It’s like you feel part of the French Resistance # you’ve got to keep on doing what you do.“It was ambiguous, where they were saying ‘ you can’t work from home you need to go to work,’ but the goalposts changed quite rapidly.“We can’t be seen to just be carrying on because that’s quite a selfish thing to do.“From my point of view it would definitely be wrong for me to sneak around and think I could work..”He said he believed he could get by until June.“We have other income, Myra’s working. It’s not disastrous for us. When this is all blown over I’ve still got a job to go to.”Mr Carmichael welcomed the announcement, but indicated they could have gone further.“MPs of all parties have been highlighting the lack of support for self-employed people for some days and I am glad that the government is starting to catch up,” he said.“As I put it to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, self-employed people are not looking for special treatment but for equal treatment with employed people. The measures today seem to go some way towards that.“There are, however, still large gaps in the support for self-employed people. The wait until June will be extremely challenging for many, especially with the reluctance of many banks to offer bridging loans currently.“Tourism, which makes up such a vital part of the local economy in the isles, is obviously highly seasonal and yet this is not recognised in the Chancellor’s plan.“Three months of government support based on an ‘annual average’ will not paper over the financial hole faced by those who rely on the usual summer trade to cover them through the rest of the year.” raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"wilma named as shetland wool week patron ","story":"This years Shetland Wool Week patron Wilma Malcolmson.The Shetland Wool Week patron for this year was named today as knitwear designer Wilma Malcolmson, who is internationally renowned for her skilfully blended Fair Isle knitwear.The much-anticipated annual hat pattern, which is now synonymous with the launch of the patron, has also been released.

Originally from Garderhouse on the West Side, she later moved to Cunningsburgh where she lived with her late husband Leonard.She established her business, Shetland Designer, in  and during that time she has seen her creations reach all four corners of the world.Mrs Malcolmson said: “I am touched and honoured to be this year’s patron. Wool week is a wonderful event that helps to bring people, not just knitters, from all around the world together.#To me, the festival represents a time of friendship, of learning from each other and an appreciation of our islands and way of le as it celebrates old and new by putting traditional patterns and techniques on equal terms with new, innovative ones.#The hat is the common bond for us all and I am delighted to have been asked to design it and become part of the wool week story.“My hat ‘Katie’s Kep’ is named after my mother Katie. It includes the patterns that she taught me when I was a peerie lass because they were her favourites. She belonged to that large group of professional knitters, without whom our Shetland colour work and lace heritage might not have been as alive and vibrant as it is today. This is my tribute to all the known and unknown designer artists of Shetland throughout the centuries.”On her love of knitting, Mrs Malcolmson said: “My mother instilled in me an interest in patterns and colours, from her I learned the importance of contrast and ‘blending’. Colour inspiration is all around us in Shetland – you only need to look at the rugged landscape, seashores the ever-changing skies to find shades that work together.”She has created four very dferent colourways for the hat using yarn from Jamieson’s of Shetland, Jamieson and Smith, Uradale Yarns and Shetland Handspun.Each company has prepared yarn kits and are available to take back orders online, but are currently unable to guarantee specic delivery dates. Customers are urged to keep an eye on the respective websites for updates.The organisers said: “We are always thrilled to announce the new patron and hat, and perhaps even more so this year. Throughout this ongoing global crisis we have received many requests urging us to release the hat pattern and we are pleased to be able to make it available, as always, as a free download from our Shetland Wool Week website.#We hope it will bring some welcome light relief and focus as well as a sense of connection for all our supporters.”#Katie#s Kep# – this year#s official wool week hat.Mrs Malcolmson added: #I really do feel that this is in the interest of knitters. Under these strange times we are living in there are so many knitters around the world taking comfort from their work and enjoying their knitting when they are self-isolating.#Knitting has been so important to Shetland all through the years. When I grew up the knitters around me were knitting to help the economy, to put food on the table. It wasn#t a hobby at that time.#The th Shetland Wool Week is due to run from th September and already a huge amount of effort has gone into preparing for the event. However, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the event remains under review.• An extensive question and answer interview with Mrs Malcolmson is available to read via the Shetland Wool Week newsletter and website. A special Facebook SWWKALhas also been launched for Katie’s Kep and the organisers are encouraging everyone to join in and share their hat works in progress, questions and photos. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"offshore worker tested positive for covid 19 after being airlifted ","story":"An offshore crew member was airlted from a floating production storage vessel west of the isles and tested positive for Covid-.The worker was airlted from the Hurricaine Energy#s Aoka Mizu vessel in the Lancaseter field and taken to the mainland, where he subsequently tested positive for the virus.Shetland Coastguard said it was not involved in the evacuation, which is said to have taken place on Wednesday.Hurricane is supporting Bluewater Lancaster ProductionLtd,operator of the Aoka Mizu FPSO, with its response.

More centres will open in the coming days, with at least one Covid- centre in each Trust area.Minister Swann said: “Primary Care Covid- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non Covid- related conditions. “Covid- centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having Covid- and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.“Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the Covid- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.”Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care Covid- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres.“This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.”Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing.“We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus.

It’s time, she said, for the people to “embrace the spirit of Northern Ireland”.Just what the “spirit of Northern Ireland” is Squinter’s not sure. So let’s see , with the benefit of close-on  years of experience, we can see how the spirit of Are Wee Country might be redeployed in the time of coronavirus.HYGIENE vw, px\"  Troubles washing protocols for handling weapons and explosives should be resumed. A y bath and hair wash are not necessary because while gunpowder residue in your hair was always a problem, coronavirus in your hair is not. Scrub the hands thoroughly with hot soap and water, but remember, it is no longer necessary to pay particular attention to your shooting arm and hand. Both require equal attention. If you’ve kept your balaclava it could be the best decision you’ve made since you said yes to the Northern Bank job. Since hand-to-face contamination is a principle spreader of the virus, your balaclava will go a long way to keep you safe. And as face masks are dficult to access, the thick wool of the balaclava makes an excellent makesht virus filter.SOCIAL DISTANCINGIt’s reported that the car parks at Tyrella beach, Helen’s Bay and Murlough Bay were packed to overflowing at the weekend, with some tourist attractions experiencing record footfall. Although the advice is that people should remain two metres apart, crowds have been assembling in the face of the growing Covid- threat. Retired senior RUC and British army figures with long experience of, ah, public order have been employed as consultants to advise the forces of law and order on how best to deploy the Spirit of Northern Ireland during times of public non-compliance. Water cannon deployed most recently at Woodvale during the Camp Twaddell national emergency are available and ready to go with a : water-bleach ratio. Baton charges are being rehearsed at the PSNI training centre at Garnerville with officers wearing hazmat suits instead of riot gear and with temperature gauges on the end of their batons. Plastic bullets are an option but will only be used as a final resort in order not to put to too much pressure on morgues and paediatric intensive care units.STOP AND QUESTION vw, px\"  Is this your car, sir  The glory days of #Northern Ireland#If you’re on your way to the shop, out for your one walk per day, oryou’re an essential worker en route to or from your job you may be stopped and questioned by the police – or even later by the British army, depending on how the crisis pans out.

Those out walking or driving while Irish should be aware that some names may lead to certain complications in your dealings with the RUC – sorry, PSNI – and the British army. Again, younger people should consult with parents grandparents on how to address this tricky problem, butthey advise you to pretend you’re called Norman or Pamela, be aware that society has changed considerably in the quarter of a century-plus since the ceasefires and you are probably best placed to pick your own non-Irish name.

In Northern Ireland, broken down by council district area, Belfast has the highest number of confirmed cases at , according to the latest available data provided by the PHA.The second highest area is Lisburn and Castlereagh with . Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon is placed third highest , followed by North Down and Ardsand Antrim and Newtownabbey in fth place with .Sixth is Fermanagh and Omagh , narrowly followed by Mid and East Antrim and Newry, Mourne and Down with both each having  confirmed cases, placing them joint seventh.Ninth is Derry and Strabane with nine cases, with Mid Ulster and Causeway ranking th and th with seven and five cases respectively. There are also seven cases where the location is unknown.Separate analysis of data, meanwhile, shows coronavirus is most prevalent in Lisburn and Castlereagh , followed by Belfastand Ards and North Down .Outlining his analysis of the PHA geographical spread of coronavirus, Dr Bamford insisted the graphic data fits with how a virus spreads among a population.He told the Belfastit was not surprising areas like Belfast, and Lisburn and Castlereagh, were recording as virus hotspots.It is what you would expect. Those are the areas with the most people, so that#s why there are more cases, explained Dr Bamford.There#s more cases in Belfast because it#s more connected. There#s also a lot of testing areas in the east [of the region].He also warned that actual numbers of people here contracting the virus are likely to be much higher than recorded cases, due to low testing numbers.This [PHA graphic] is based on the number of confirmed cases, and we know that there is going to be at least  times the number of known cases.However, he stressed the numbers could accurately reflect the spread of Covid- across Northern Ireland.These number of cases will reflect the percentage of a total, but they will maybe accurately reflect the picture, said Dr Bamford.Noting the lower number of confirmed cases, largely located in the west of Northern Ireland - indicated on the PHA graphic as white or light pink - the virologist emphasised that council areas with the lowest recorded cases should not be drawn into a  sense of security.Nowhere is safe. If we left this [fight against coronavirus where it is] and didn#t do anything, Derry and Strabane would [go darker on the map] as well as Mid Ulster, he insisted.We#re dealing with a small number of confirmed cases the dference between Derry and Strabane and Mid Ulster [changing from white to pink on the map], for example, could only be a single confirmed case, he insisted.The expert also cautioned against Northern Ireland overall descending into complacency as the lockdown continues.Northern Ireland as a whole is a couple of weeks behind the rest of the UK, even England and London. But we have the potential to reach those numbers and that kind of situationwe ignore the seriousness of coronavirus, said the virologist.Authorities here are making preparations in anticipation of a surge in cases. Work is under way to establish large, temporary field hospitals for coronavirus patients after modelling indicated that the current health service network in Northern Ireland may not have the capacity to cope at the peak of the outbreak. A soon-to-be-decommissioned Co Down Army base will be used as a temporary morguefacilities are overwhelmed.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the s, she was scouted by one of Americas biggest record labels and asked to name her price.She shared the stage with the likes of Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow and the Dixie Chicks, and rubbedshoulders with A-list actors.Noella is great at telling stories, and she has hundreds - living round the corner from Ben Affleck, hanging out with with Winona Ryder, and partying with Hugh Heffner at the Playboy MansionHer le in America was the stuff dreams were made of, with a critically acclaimed album, sold out gigs, luxury hotels and chauffeurs.But why didnt we know about about all this I didnt tell anyone, she shrugs.Probably because she didnt care you can see why the A-list fell for her, the beautul Irish girl who was deeply unimpressed by fame.The signs were there from an early age that Noella liked to do things her own way.She was asked to leave her local folk group aged  over creative dferences.I forgot my song book, but I didnt need it. I knew every song, she laughs, taking a drag of her vape.The teacher told me to go and get my book. I said, I dont need it and she said, Go and get your book and I said, Shove it up your arse.She came back looking for me, but I never went back.Derry was always going to be too small for Noella and at  she headed to London with her guitar on her back and gigs with the likes of Van Morrison already under her belt.There was nothing here in , she says.I would have done anything to escape.Not long after she arrived, The NoellaHuttonBand landed a residency at Madame JoJos, a legendary Soho strip club frequented by actors and popstars.Youd have people like Robbie Williams, theyd all come in there mincing about, says Noella.Before we went on wed be sitting in the green room with two totally naked strippers.But it was just normal. It wasnt a big deal. It was just work and they were so professional.Mariah Carey came in one night and she tried to move my friends from the front seats and I said, Naw, thats my friends there.She asked meI had a demo and I said naw. Honestly, I just didnt want to give her anything, she smiles.Boy George was another regular and after watching her play, he asked her to sign to his label More Protein.He said to me, No one has ever scared me before, but you scare me, she recalls.So, you signed with Boy George Naw.One of things he said to me was, So, youre a big dyke then That got my back up right away. I said George, my sexuality has got f**k all to do with what I am.Its such a small, small part of who I am.And its really nobodys business. It wasnt because I was ashamed, I just thought, Im not going to ride on the back of that honey.If he hadnthave said that, who knows  But it just wasnt meant for me.The pair still hit it off and Noella sang with Boy George at a string of gigs in Shepherds Bush Empire, dueting on a punk version of Karma Chameleon.They also enjoyed wild nights out together, where people used to confuse them for brother and sister.He was a good guy - very intelligent.And he loved me and he was so proud of me.Noella was having the time of her le, singing at Paul OGradys thbut still working at Camden Market on the weekends to make ends meet.She was hanging out with the likes of Oasis, Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence and the buzz around her was starting to grow.Then she got the call that would change her le.It was from the head of Radioactive Records who had signed the likes of Garbage and Debbie Harry.He asked me how much I wanted, I could barely afford to make it to the bus stop, she laughs.Radioactive asked Noella who she wanted to produce her album and she chooseJerry Harrison of Talking Heads, who had just produced for the American rock band Lives album Throwing Copper.The label flew her to LA to record it and soon she was living the American dream with a substantial advance and her own cab driver who was on call around the clock.I was just happy to be able to do stuff for people, she says.Sure whats the point of having money  You cant take it with you.Noella released her self titled album NoellaHutton in , toured extensively in the States and was put up in the likes of New Yorks Cha Hotel.I slept the best I ever have in my le when I was in New York, she says.It was just the characters. Everything.I felt at home there.Her husky, soulful voice was also in hot demand commercially and featured in ads for Lexus, Nike, Coca-Cola and Toyota.In  Noella played to , people at Canadian singer Sarah McLachlans Lilith Fair where she shared the stage with Nelly Furtado and Christina Aguilera.We had to do a press conference with Sky News, I just kept thinking Im a wee girl from Derry.Despite reaching such dizzying heights, very few back home knew was happening.I never told anybody, I just didnt think it was important, she says candidly.I dont think Im anything special, do you know what I mean I was just writing and playing and having a wee laugh. Thats very important. Youre only here for a wee while.Fame never interested me. It was terrying.I knew too many people who were miserable and had no le.I had too much badness to get up to.And what a le Noella was having. She was dating Taryn Manningand her album was No  on the playlist of the Virgin record store in Hollywood.She was living the kind of le most of us can only dream of, but her mental health was suffering and in  Noella suffered a complete nervous breakdown.Everything just crashed in my head at the one time, she says with characteristic frankness.It all closed in at the one time.I had just been putting it off my whole le.Everything that had went on reared its head.Id had a breakdown in London too, but this was on a dferent scale.It was just trauma. You think youve dealt with certain things. But naw, you havent.Im amazed that Im still here to be honest.Noellas sister, JeanetteHutton, brought her back to Derry, where she worked very hard to get better with the help of Gransha Hospital and the support of her family.A couple of years later she met American singer songwriter and producer Justin Black, who had her album as a teenager growing up in Arkansas.He said my album inspired him to play the guitar, she laughs.He didnt even know I was Irish.She also formed the band Blood with her sister Jeanette and brother-in-law Ruairi ODoherty and two years ago they released an album of the same name.Shes the eldest girl in the family and Im the youngest and all we do is laugh at stupid sh***, said Noella.Shes so loved. Shes brilliant. Shes my hero.In recent years Noella has also channelled her energy into animal rescue charity Friends of Rescue founded by her best friend Suzanne Fleming.Together with Suzanne, Keith Rutherford and Carly Russell, Noella helps rescue and rehome neglected and abused animals.The day before yesterday we rescued  dogs, she said.Its the most rewarding, heartbreaking, devastating, incredible all-encompassing thing.Im fearless when it comes to the well being of animals, children or old people.Noella is now sponsored by world-renowned bespoke guitar makers Emerald Guitars, who are based in St Johnston.Justin persuaded her to record her recently released solo album Love and Liars which deserves to be heard on the world stage, but Noella has no plans for a big tour.Ive honestly never made a plan in my le, she says.I dont believe in forcing squaresinto circles, do you know what I mean Its something that has to happenorganically, naturally.And this feels right at the minute.To find out more about Noella, visit her Facebook page The First Noella.Her music is available at noellahutton.bandcampA documentary about Noellas le, The First Noella, made by Justin Black is now available on YouTube.If you would like to support Friends of Rescue you can find them at Friends of Rescue Ireland on Facebook.For more information on Emerald Guitars visitwww.emeraldguitars googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You have that dark humour.In the book Joanne talks about her pregnancy with Hannah, which was fraught with dficulty as doctors thought she may miscarry again, due to an incompetent cervix.Terriedof losing her baby, she was put in six months of bed rest during the winter of .Their beautul daughter Hannah was eventually born safe and well, following a caesarean section.I had to have a section because she was breach from  weeks, recalls Joanne.The consultant told me thats what saved her from going the same way as Jacob.They said she was standing up in my womb holding on to my ribs.Joanne got pregnant again but the pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially le-threatening complication where the baby grows outside the womb.The baby couldnt survive and the couple were told there was no option but to end the pregnancy.The operation didnt go to plan and Joanne had to have one of her fallopiantubes removed and two blood transfusions.After I came back from surgery I was in recovery for hours and when my mammy saw me she got very emotional.She said I know you want to give Hannah a sibling but you are my child and Hannah needs her motherI said right Lawrence, Im not trying any more. We have to draw a line under it.It killed me.I could still have another baby, but I know mentally that I couldnt cope.Throughout her pregnancies Joanne had been keeping diaries of everything that happened.Ive always written, she says. Even before this book I always joked that I was nursing until I decided what to write about.I wrote a diary after Jacob and I still have it. I suppose its like the mood diaries we use in work so people can see they are getting better.I made a diary of my pregnancy with Hannah and then after she was born I was content and I thought this is great, Im finally a mammy.I loved being in that mammy role and all the funny stuff that happened and I decided I really should keep a diary of all this.Joanne sent her diary to friends who were living in America and Australia as a way of keeping in touch and gradually built up the confidence to show some work colleagues too.One girl at work has a sister who is a blogger The Red Duchess, and she told me I should share it as a blog.I had it all on my computer to show Hannah when she is older anyway so I did it and I thought sure this is lovely.It wasnt until she was forced to take three months off work after breaking her shoulder that Joanne started thinking about turning the blog into a book.She contacted local authors Claire Allan and Felicity McCall for advice and they gave her the confidence to approach a number of publishers.Despite receiving positive feedback, Joanne found the process a bit overwhelmingand decided to shelve the plans for a book to concentrate on her career.Around this time a promotion came up at work and Lawrence encouraged her to go for it.I thought it would be a wee challenge but I was sick nearly every day when I was studying for the interview, she admits.Doubts would pop into my head like well, you were s*** at pregnancy and stuff.I did the interview and it was horrendous. Afterwards I cried so much and I knew it wasnt right.I was always grand at interviews and I never let it get to me. But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I want to commend the community led volunteer responses that are mobilising right across the City and District. Its heartening to see so many people come forward to assist the wellbeing of their neighbours and communities during this time. These services will come under increasing pressure in the coming months so I want to ask that everyone who is fit to do so considers offering their helpthey can.This is a rapidly changing situation and as a Council will continue to be proactive and to work with all our partner agencies and organisations to support local people and ensure they have the information, services and assistance they need to stay safe, well and adequately provided for through the very challenging times ahead.At the meeting members discussed the possible delivery mechanisms for the effective allocation of resources, as well as the governance and coordination required to support the local community and voluntary sector.It was agreed that Council would advance with the necessary governance arrangements in place to deliver annually agreed support to these services. This will include committing funds to support service level agreements and an extension of the community venues funds which have been in place for the last three years to ensure core costs will be in place to continue services.Council officers will contact impacted groups directly with letters of offer and advance payments as quickly as possible.An additional joint funding package is also being developed with the Department for Communities to support the continuation of the advice tribunal service, increasing telephone capacity and extending working hours. Council is hopeful that this investment will be confirmed shortly.During the meeting Council members paid tribute to local service providers Advice North West, Dove House and Resource Centre Derry and the work they are doing reaching out to the community under growing pressure, and stressed the importance of stepping up assistance at this stage.Councillors strongly welcomed these and other measures put forward, and agreed to further review demands on services and to lobby government for the necessary financial support to maintain and strengthen community services as needed to respond to the ongoing COVID emergency.A spokesperson for the three local service providers welcomed the news, saying: We are delighted that these resources are being made available. Demand has been unprecedented and our staff have been working around the clock to meet the needs of local people who are naturally very concerned for the welfare of themselves and loved ones at this time.We will channel this support into the effective delivery of services and supporting our staff throughout this crisis.The full report from todays meeting is available to view now athttps:bit.ly xnnvv googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. googletag.cmd.push McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres. Local politicians say that their key priority is to protect the public and staff.The closure of Tyrella and Delamont comes after Sundayrsquos sunshine brought people out in their hundreds to ious locations across the district, despite government advice not to engage in mass gatherings.beachAnyone in Newcastle town centre last Sunday could have been forgiven for thinking that it was Easter, while nearby Murlough beach was crammed with visitors.It was a similar scene in Ballyhornan and along other parts of the Lecale coastline, including Kilclief and Killard.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owens said she fully supported the decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park.She said: ldquoI totally support this decision. It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Her previous experience had been restricted to cars, tractors and Land Rovers, but she was always keen on tackling something bigger.ldquoBeing so fond of driving, it was only natural that I would take such a job. Lorries were out of the question, as drivers often have to load their vehicles, so when I say the advert for bus drivers I thought I would apply, said Noelene.ldquoI never thought it possible that they would accept me, so it was a pleasant surprise when I was offered the chance to attend the Ulsterbus training school.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

It might be that % of the UK already has coronavirus, , in UK and , in Northern Ireland, and perhaps many times more, but with a lower fatality rate than expected.

Please try again later.Submitting...The horrying reports of Covid- sweeping through care homes in Italy and Spain are now happening in parts of the UK.In China, it is reported that % of patients who recovered from coronavirus in one province tested positive again, which suggests they are still carrying the virus.In Africa, which seemed at first to have few cases well after much of the rest of the world, Covid- is now appearing across the continent. As anyone who has been to sub Saharan Africa will know, the health systems cannot cope with disease and poverty in normal times, and certainly won’t be able to do sothe pandemic takes hold.But amidst all the gloom it is good to retain perspective and to be aware of glimmers of hope.The death toll in the UK as a whole will probably rise by a magnitude of hundreds more fatalities each day in the coming week.When that happens the clamour for further factory closures and restrictions will grow ever louder.But some statistics suggest the present trajectory of ultimate deaths might lead to the UK outcome being at the lower end ofprojections, which range from , deaths to ,. Some models even have the UK coming in well under , deaths and closer to annual seasonal flu deaths.The NHS, while under immense pressure, particularly in the capital, is not yet as hard hit as some experts had feared at this stage.Coronavirus has clearly penetrated Europe and America to a large extent. This might sound like further bad news but might not beit is evidence that a much larger number of people than we realise are already infected, with perhaps a lower percentage death toll than the % that had been expected.The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt recently suggested there might be , infections for each reported death .Using this rule of thumb, the UK is already approaching a million infections. It might even have several million cases. Anecdotal evidence for widespread infection is strong.Consider the famous people known to have it. There are not that many famous people —look up at the top of the opposite page: every day newspapers run such daily lists of famous people’s birthdays. Most of us have become familiar with the famous people who share our own birthday. Some are names we know well, but often there are names on the list we do not know.Most people will know on average at most seven or eight names a day, which suggests that we all have in our head perhaps , famous names .Yet already a notable number of that small pool of people is infected.Even before Boris Johnson and Prince Charles got Covid-, the list of famous names who have it was getting ever bigger and included Prince Albert II of Monaco, the EU leader Michel Barnier, the actors Tom Hanks, Idris Elba, Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta,model Linda Lusardi, GMTV star Fiona Phillips, among others.Celebrities such as this are a random group of people: there is no obvious reason why they would be more likely to get it than others.Similarly most of us know, personally, a relatively small number of people, probably measured in the hundreds rather than thousands , yet more and more of us know someone who has it. I know of five such people .In addition to people we know who have it, there will be others we know who do but of whose infection we have not yet learned of, and others still we know who are symptomless and do not know themselves.So it is not at all hard to believe that at least % of the population on these islands already has itand perhaps many times that number.That the NHS is coping at this stage is an encouraging indicator of outcomes .Last night for an update I talked to a local expert, Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP Committee of BMA for NI, who wrote for us recently on the importance of not moving too early on things such as school closures. He said: “The projection is that every hospital and ICU bed in two weeks time will be full. “The speed of the spread is slower than we initially feared, which we think is due to the restrictions that have been introduced, so there is no room whatsoever for complacency. “What people do know will dictate where we are one or two weeks from now.”So lockdowns remain essential. But they are causing vast economic damage that will ruin lives around the world and while we must guard against complacency in this crisis, we must also be ready to begin to relax restrictions at the first moment data suggests it is safe to do so.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor"},{"url":null,"title":"postponed historic passion play goes back vow made  ","story":"Coronavirus: Latest map showing spread across Northern Ireland – with more young than old infected – as deaths hit double-digitsCoronavirus: Latest map of the hotspots for the virus in Northern Ireland shows rate of expansion in a single dayNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionColumnistsPostponed historic Passion Play goes back to a vow made in Almost lost in the current barrage of closures, cancellations and postponements in every sphere of le, an announcement on March  resonated with the poignant irony of history.By The RoamerThursday, th March , : pm\"\"Jesus Christ and John.  Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.
