The tariffs will affect £900m of imports, while the ban on luxury goods is likely to apply to luxury vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art.  Products affected by the new tariffs on Russian imports are: The government says the products were chosen to inflict maximum damage on the Russian economy while minimising the impact on the UK:  The UK is also denying Russia and Belarus access to Most Favoured Nation tariff for hundreds of their exports, which will remove key benefits of WTO membership. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said: Figures from data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on Monday was 163.7p, up from 150p at the end of February. This takes the cost of filling a typical 55-litre family car with petrol above £90 for the first time. The average cost of a litre of diesel on Monday was a record 173.7p. Oil prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but declined in recent days, leading to a cut in wholesale costs for fuel retailers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams says petrol retailers need to pass on the impact of falling crude prices: Economic sentiment tumbled by the most since the ZEW economic research institute began tracking it in December 1991.  It fell from 54.3 in February to -39.3 points this month, as the conflict and sanctions imposed on Russia threaten the recovery. A measure of current economic conditions also slumped (to -21.4 from -8.1) President Achim Wambach said that fears of surging inflation had also risen, following the jump in oil and commodity prices.  Britain will no longer issue any new guarantees, loans or insurance for exports to Russia and Belarus.  Export finance support helps companies win contracts, fulfil them, and get insurance in case their buyer defaults. UK Export Finance (UKEF), the UK’s export credit agency, says it is still supporting trade with Ukraine with £3.5bn of capacity available “as part of its continuing and unwavering alliance”. This backing would help UK exporters and Ukrainian buyers access the finance they need to trade commercially. Without government export credit support, any financial backing from the private sector to the region is “virtually impossible”, UKEF says.  Labour MP Emily Thornberry, shadow Attorney General, says the government should have acted faster: The Department for International Trade also reports that fifty-four licences for exports to Russia have been voluntarily surrendered by UK businesses, while 33 new licence applications to export items to support Ukraine have been submitted.Inchcape, which operates in around 40 countries, told shareholders: Cigarette maker Imperial Brands is quitting Russia, joining the swelling ranks of Western companies exiting due to the Ukraine war. Imperial said this morning it has begun negotiations with a local third party to transfer its Russian assets and operations, saying this was the best option for its 1,000 staff in Russia.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said: That’s its lowest level since the start of March, after it hit $139barrel just over a week ago. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says China’s Covid lockdowns could cause a fresh supply chain crisis: Fears of a regulatory crackdown by US officials on China’s tech firms added to worries that Covid cases in China have doubled overnight, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Last week, the SEC named the first batch of Chinese stocks who could be forced to delist in the US for refusing to open their books to regulators.  Failure to meet auditing rules could cut China’s tech firms off from Wall Street - where they had boomed in 2020, before slumping as Beijing also clamped down on the sector. JPMorgan Chase \u0026amp Co added to the angst, by downgrading 28 Chinese stocks listed in the United States and Hong Kong. They also flagged the risk that the US hit China with sanctions, if it provides military assistance to Russia. The lockdowns in multiple cities, including technology hub Shenzhen, are threatening to disrupt the world’s second-largest economy, if the outbreak isn’t curbed quickly. Rising tensions between Beijing and Washington over Ukraine are also hitting China’s stocks. US officials fear that China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support during its war on Ukraine, and is considering sending military supplies such as armed drones. That has raised concerns that China could be hit by US. sanctions over Russia’s war.Paul Dales of Capital Economics says: Last month, governor Andrew Bailey was widely criticised for saying that workers shouldn’t seek big pay rises to keep pace with inflation. Those fears over a wage-price spiral won’t have faded, predicts Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club: Derrick Dunne, CEO of YOU Asset Management, says labour shortages will worry the Bank, with more than 1.3m vacancies over the last quarter. Total pay (which includes bonuses) was lifted by strong growth in the financial sector, where bankers saw the biggest bonuses since the financial crisis. The Gambling Commission has named rival Allwyn Entertainment, a Czech gambling firm, as its preferred applicant to take on the Lottery in 2024. Camelot has run the Lottery since it began in 1994 - since when it has raised £45bn for good causes, the Commission says. That’s 1.1 percentage point higher than before the coronavirus pandemic -- and one reason that the unemployment rate has fallen. The increase in activity over the last quarter was driven by those who are economically inactive because of long-term sickness and those who retired.  Minister for Employment, Mims Davies MP says the government is focused on helping people back into work: The UK’s cost of living squeeze has tightened, with basic pay falling behind inflation at the fastest rate in over seven years. There were nearly 32.5m people in employment - up 380,000k in the last year, but still 580k less than before the pandemic.  Vacancies rose to a new record of 1,318,000 in the three months to February, as companies struggled to fill roles. The number of people on company payrolls hit a new record high in February, up 275,000 to a new record of 29.7 million. More details and reation to follow. Stock markets are edgy as Covid-19 infections rise sharply in China, raising fears that more lockdowns could be introduced to slow the pandemic. Domestically-transmitted cases more than doubled yesterday to 3,507, testing the country’s tough “dynamic clearance” approach to Covid. Yesterday, a province of 24 million people was locked down, leading companies such as Apple supplier Foxconn to suspend work. European markets are set to open lower. Britain is expected to name hundreds of oligarchs, iniduals and organisations with links to the Putin regime who will be added to the UK’s sanctions list, after the economic crime bill was fast-tracked last night. Investors are also watching Russia, which faces a $117m debt repayment tomorrow. Last night, Moscow said it has started the payment process, but it’s not clear if the payment is in US dollars -- the currency they were issued in -- or roubles.  With much of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves frozen, it may not be able to make the dollar payments, meaning it could default (after a 30-day grace period).

The official attendance on each of the four days 12 months ago was around 41, and without wishing to sound in any way ungrateful, watching it from your sofa was very much the way to go. The Festival is not the Festival without the atmosphere, and it felt as though historic achievements – like Rachael Blackmore lifting the prize for the meeting’s top jockey for the first time – effectively went unacknowledged. The race, you realised, is only a part of the experience. The reception afterwards is what makes it complete.  I can still remember the bedlam as Like-A-Butterfly and Charlie Swan came up the hill in the Supreme Novice Hurdle 20 years ago almost to the day, in the first Festival race after the 2001 meeting was lost to foot-and-mouth. The pent-up energy and frustration of 24 months away exploded from the stands, and we can expect something similar shortly after 1.30 today, not least if Dysart Dynamo and Constitution Hill, the big hopes for Ireland and Britain respectively, jump the last together.  Honeysuckle and Rachael Blackmore will also get the huge ovation they deserved 12 months ago if they can repeat their success in the Champion Hurdle. The British runners’ attempt to keep at least within shouting distance of their Irish counterparts will be another theme of the day, as Alan King’s Edwardstone goes to post as favourite for the Arkle Trophy (2.10) against a host of Irish challengers, while the two handicaps on the card, at 2.50 and 4.50, both have full fields and offer the kind of challenge that few punters can resist.  The first race – and the traditional roar to send them on their way - is at 1.30, picks for all seven races are here and all the news, results and gossip will be here on the live blog as soon as it drops.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his

punishing one despot for starting a war in Europe requires cosying up to another in the Middle East.Mr Johnson says the barbaric actions of Vladimir Putin in invading Ukraine are “testing not just Ukraine but all of humanity” and Britain must respond by moving away from “dependence on Russian oil”.As Britain’s Russian energy boycott contributes to pushing oil prices to record highs at home, the Government says that “demand can be met by alternative suppliers”.So it is with cap in hand that Mr Johnson will fly to Riyadh, one of the few oil producers with the spare capacity to immediately ramp up production, to ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to pump more oil to ease prices.While Mr Johnson has condemned Mr Putin for launching an illegal invasion in which Ukrainian civilians have been indiscriminately targeted in their homes, hospitals and schools, he is far more circumspect about Saudi Arabia\u0027s 36-year-old de facto leader, with whom he reportedly corresponds via WhatsApp messenger. Mr Johnson views Riyadh as “a partner”, his spokesman said last week, which means the kingdom’s de facto leader is not subject to the same criticism as Putin.Thus it is not thought Mr Johnson will publicly speak out against the kingdom carrying out the largest mass executions in its history over the weekend. It also puts Mr Johnson at odds with Joe Biden, the US president, who was elected promising to challenge Saudi human rights abuses and hold Prince Mohammed to account for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.British arms sales to Saudi ArabiaLikewise, Saudi Arabia’s disastrous air war in Yemen is not likely to be subject to the same criticism as Putin’s Ukraine invasion.A war more distant and entrenched than Ukraine, Yemen’s seven-year-old conflict is nonetheless described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It is also fuelled by billions of pounds worth of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.British-made bombs and planes have been implicated in scores of Saudi strikes that have killed civilians. Over half of the Saudi air force aircraft flying sorties over the country are UK-supplied, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, with some even dropping UK-made cluster munitions on the impoverished country.Saudi Arabia says it is defending itself against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, which have attacked the kingdom with drones and missile strikes. But its air campaign has faced accusations of indiscriminately targeting civilians, while a blockade of Houthi-controlled areas has contributed to pushing the country to the brink of famine.Rather than pressuring Saudi Arabia to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict, Mr Johnson may be asked to pledge further weapons sales or British support for Riyadh’s security policy towards Yemen and arch-rival Iran, according to Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East programme.Facing a cost of living crisis at home and a war in Europe that threatens to escalate, Mr Johnson may have to calculate whether that is a price worth paying for Saudi Arabia agreeing to increase oil production.More from NewsAlmost 89,000 Britons apply to open their homes to Ukrainian refugeesPolitics latest news: We \u0026#39must try to do more\u0026#39 to protect Ukraine from Russian air strikes, says Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine latest news: Two killed by shelling in Kyiv as fighting intensifies around the capitalAre you a Ukrainian refugee looking to come to the UK?

The papers and TV news have been full of pictures of Russian vehicles in various states of disrepair or destruction. Some images have verged on the comic: long lines of dark green vehicles abandoned, or stuck in the mud on the road to Kyiv, or armoured vehicles being towed away by gleeful Ukrainians driving tractors. Others have been awful: the charred and smouldering husks of tanks, their turrets blown clean off, or large personnel carriers reduced to shrapnel. Last week there were two videos in three days that appeared to show Russian armour being ambushed by Ukrainian infantry. It was also reported that Russian soldiers faced freezing to death in their tanks as the temperature hit -20C. If Vladimir Putin’s original plan was a rapid, armour-driven assault on Ukrainian cities, it has not worked out that way. So far his tanks have let him down.Up against a nimble, determined Ukrainian resistance, in cold and muddy weather, the Russian approach has at times looked hopelessly old-fashioned. Reports suggest they have already lost as many as 200 tanks, a huge number, albeit a small fraction of the overall force they might draw on if necessary. “The Russian tactics have been terrible,” says Nicholas Drummond, a defence consultant who served in the Welsh Guards. “They didn’t establish air superiority and they haven’t brought their artillery to bear. Considering that the Russians wrote the book on modern blitzkrieg tactics, their failure is shocking.”  Christopher Foss, a former editor of Jane’s Armour and Artillery, agrees. “I think they thought they’d do it all in 72 hours, but they didn’t and now they’re bogged down,” he says. “The armoured personnel carriers and jeeps have been shattered. Some tanks have had their tracks blown off by ‘mobility killers’. Others have obviously been penetrated because their ammunition has gone up and the turret has come off. It looks like the Russian army just went bouncing down the road hoping they’d get away with it, and they didn’t.” Much of the Russian equipment is hopelessly antiquated, he adds, but the results have been disappointing all the same. A crucial factor in their struggle has been the proliferation of modern, highly effective anti-tank weapons among the Ukrainian forces. In the weeks leading up to the invasion, Britain supplied a reported 2,000 NLAW (Next Generation Anti Tank Weapon) weapons to Ukraine, numbers that have been bolstered further by contributions from the US, Sweden and other allies. This week Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced the UK had sent 3,615 NLAWs in total, to which it would be adding a “small consignment” of its predecessor anti-tank system, the Javelin missile. These weapons enable infantrymen to take out even large tanks with rockets that are able to go up and plummet down in a high arc. This means they hit their targets from above, bypassing the armour on the front and sides of the tank. The NLAWs have been so effective that Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky have been joking about them. Ukrainians pronounce them ‘N-love’ rather than ‘N-law’. According to reports over the weekend, the Ukrainian president sang “All you need is N-love,” to the tune of the Beatles song, down the phone to the Prime Minister. Ukrainian forces have also apparently been saying “God save the Queen” as they fire the weapons. The NLAWs have a range of 800m, which means operators can fire them and scarper before the armour has a chance to respond.“This could be a ‘battleship moment’ for the tank,” says Drummond, referring to the moment in World War II when planes, aircraft carriers and submarines rendered the largest battleships too expensive and cumbersome to be worthwhile. “Handheld anti-tank weapons have been a great equaliser. A little guy in a trench with a $100,000 anti-tank weapon can defeat a $10m tank. From an economical and tactical point of view, it’s not sustainable. We were worried that Javelin might be obsolete by 2025, but it has obliterated everything it’s come up against.” While modern armies will likely always need armoured personnel carriers to transport infantry across varied terrain, the model of building an army around a large Main Battle Tank (MBT) with a big gun on top, which has dominated defence planning since World War II, looks increasingly outdated. Tanks form a dwindling part of British strategy. Last year Wallace announced that just 148 Challenger 3 tanks would be delivered at a cost of £800m, fewer than have already been destroyed in Ukraine. It seems entirely possible that Challenger 3 will be Britain’s last conventional main battle tank upgrade. Armour has been a thorn in the side of the British army for decades. The new generation of Ajax armoured vehicles has been plagued by problems with noise, vibration and handling. Last week it was reported that some of its issues might never be resolved. The Dutch did away with their tanks in 2011, although leased some back after Russia’s invasion of Crimea. While the US Army still has plenty of tanks, in 2020 the US Marine Corps announced it was doing away with tanks in order to focus on rocket artillery, drones and other high-tech equipment fit for a future war with China. In a statement, it said that despite the tank’s “long and honourable history in the wars of the past” it was “operationally unsuitable” for the threats the Marines were likely to face in the 21st century. Since they were invented, tanks have steadily become better armoured, with larger guns, more sophisticated electronics, and larger price tags. These developments have added weight. With many Nato tanks weighing 80+ tonnes they are difficult to deploy and operate. A modern battle tank is equipped with a suite of high-tech defence systems. Among them are explosive reactive armour, which explodes when it is hit to neutralise the incoming munition active protection systems can intercept incoming anti-tank missiles while electronic counter measures can incapacitate nearby drones or rockets. But these bells and whistles can be expensive, heavy and power-intensive, against threats that are becoming cheaper and more effective. At current rates of progress, the maths will stop adding up very soon, if it hasn’t already. “We’re hitting the limit of how protected you can make a platform without making it too large or heavy to fit on civilian infrastructure,” says Dr Jack Watling at defence think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). “There are limits to how creative you can be. They have to be narrow enough to fit on a railway car, which limits how long they can be, because for tracks to turn they have to be on specific proportions, with a length about 1.4 times the width. The constraints on tank design were basically decided in the 19th century by someone working out how to fit a horse and cart on a train. “At the same time, the lethality of what is firing at them is increasing exponentially. Armoured vehicle design has always been a balance of trade-offs between mobility, protection and firepower. It’s wrong to see this moment as the death of the tank. But we’re likely to see a radical shift in tank design, towards prioritising mobility and firepower rather than protection. “When I say that to people who actually have to be in the tanks, they look at me with a certain amount of concern,” he adds. “And if I say that it doesn’t matter, you can put all the protection on it you want but you’ll die anyway, that doesn’t make them happy either.”This is not the first time the tank has looked out of date. Experts have been predicting its demise since at least the Yom Kippur War of 1973, only for the tank to reassert itself. The first Gulf War was a triumph for US tank commanders. At the battle of Easting 73 in February 1991, nine M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks destroyed 28 Iraqi tanks, admittedly obsolete Russian ones, along with 16 armoured personnel carriers and 30 trucks in just 23 minutes without suffering losses. But terrain is all. What works on an open desert plain doesn’t in the woods or a city. Even as recently as the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia’s traditional battle tanks, the T-72s, looked like a vital part of what is called combined arms tactics, in which infantry in armoured carriers are supported by tanks, artillery, engineers and air power. Eight years on, however, the landscape looks different again. The Ukrainian tactics seem to have worked out how to engage Russian armour with small, mobile units in urban environments, where Russia’s strength in numbers is less of an advantage. Drone technology has advanced, too. The long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, which reached a crisis in 2020, proved how vulnerable traditional armour could be to modern weaponry. Footage distributed widely online showed dozens of vehicles being blown up where they stood by small, powerful drones.“Loitering munitions were a game-changer,” says Drummond. Also called ‘suicide drones’, these are missiles launched by infantry from tubes, which fly around the battlefield for several hours, looking for targets. When one is spotted, the loitering munition then es down and destroys it. “A new tactic we’re seeing is infantry advancing in protected mobility vehicles, before moving forward covertly on foot to engage tank targets,” Drummond adds. “Or using loitering munitions from well behind the front line.”While tactics will evolve to take advantage of new technology, modern armies will continue to need armoured protection for soldiers on the battlefield. In some senses armour has never been more important. The conflict in Ukraine has been a reminder that there are aggressors who cannot be defeated with drones and special forces alone. But armour, defined generally, is different from the traditional image of a large, costly main battle tank, with a long barrel protruding from its turret. As the images from Ukraine show, without air superiority, and versus a determined enemy with the right kit, tanks can be sitting ducks.“We’re unlikely to see massive tank on tank encounters again,” Drummond says. “And the tank of the future will not be the tank as we know it.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: We \u0026#39must try to do more\u0026#39 to protect Ukraine from Russian air strikes, says Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine latest news: Two killed by shelling in Kyiv as fighting intensifies around the capitalAre you a Ukrainian refugee looking to come to the UK?

They say truth is the first casualty of war but, for newspaper columnists, it’s self-respect. You could hardly move for articles breathing heavily over Zelensky’s combat gear, his bravery, his leadership, all conveyed by a slick media operation. Men wanted to be him, women wanted to be with him, with the caveat that they would prefer not to be under constant bombardment. Regular blokes cursed their luck. All that time wasted on self-improvement, when it turns out that all women want is a handsome comedian-turned-war-hero president with a law degree who can dance.Unsurprisingly this Zelensky-thirst has spread upwards from the general population, through the media and into the political class. One leader above all appears to be suffering from crippling Zelenskyitis. French president Emmanuel Macron has evidently been gazing on his Ukrainian counterpart’s impeccable media campaign with such envy that it clouds his judgment. How else to explain the bizarre series of photoshoots emanating from the Élysée? Last week, after an unsuccessful phone call with Putin, we saw Macron, in a white shirt, in three poses of anguish: solely clutching the back of his chair in Versailles pinching the bridge of his nose in anguish hands knitted in pain in front of his face. More photos emerged today. Over the weekend Mr Macron’s look has evolved from “corporate burnout” to “hacker luxe”. A faint barbe d\u0027un jour has appeared on his usually hairless features. Was France importing all its razors from Russia? The white shirtsleeves have gone, replaced by a black French special forces hoodie and jeans, as if at any moment he might be called upon to hack a mainframe or launch a Molotov cocktail at a tank. In one picture he clutches his documents, one eyebrow raised quizzically. In another he talks with purpose into his phone. In the most striking, he stands in his quite literally palatial office facing his advisers with both hands on hips, a stance known to cricketers as the “double-teapot”. Presumably the pose is designed to imply action and purpose, but the effect is closer to a paintball instructor admonishing a stag do for taking their goggles off again. Still, we can’t blame him for having a crack. Zelensky’s heroics have seen his approval rating improve from 25 per cent to over 90. Any politician would want a piece of that and Macron has an election coming up in April. He cannot bank on France being invaded between now and then, as much as Jacob Rees-Mogg might like to oblige.The problem for Mr Macron, as for other leaders, is that political photoshoots must match the weight of the real-world events. A bit of primping and presentation is forgivable, but the gravitas cannot be forced. When Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and co were photographed looking serious as they watched the Bin Laden raid, it felt appropriate. Liz Truss in full getup on an aircraft carrier looks like your aunt won a competition. The fraudulence of staged pictures is starker when there is war going on. Macron has fallen short of this elusive balance. If Zelensky looks like the man for the job Macron looks like a man working for Steve Jobs, less wartime leader than Warhammer leader. Whatever else might be said of Boris Johnson, he has realised that while it’s fine to go jogging in brogues and swimming trunks, sometimes the situation is too serious for a silly outfit. Even if a cameraman is present.More from NewsPolitics latest news: We \u0026#39must try to do more\u0026#39 to protect Ukraine from Russian air strikes, says Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine latest news: Two killed by shelling in Kyiv as fighting intensifies around the capitalAre you offering to host a Ukrainian refugee?

It should, but it probably won’t. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the slaughter of innocent civilians by Putin’s military forces guarantees the Kremlin killer will go down in history as a reviled leader who wrecked his own country to destroy another. Because many more will die in a terrible conflict that is all about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour. The bloodshed is escalating as the war runs out of control, with missiles hitting a base near the Polish border and the fatal shooting of award-winning US filmmaker Brent Renaud. No one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw.  Visas shame The great generosity of the British people towards Ukrainian refugees is far more inspiring than Conservative ministers who had to be dragged kicking and screaming every step of the way. It is absolutely shaming that just , visas have been issued when over . million desperate Ukrainians have fled Putin’s terror.  While the bureaucrats continue to put up obstacles, millions are prepared to open their homes to those seeking sanctuary here. The Refugee Council’s concern over the level of support for war victims and Labour’s accusations of foot-dragging reveal the truth about the £-a-month Homes for Ukraine offer. Those arriving require sympathy and help, and genuine fears need to be addressed. Star power Putinaposs growing isolation was again underlined as stars expressed support for Ukraine at last night’s Baftas.

Lord Young of Norwood Green stood up just after pm to speak in the catchily-titled Genetically Modied OrganismsRegulations . But the -year-old was blocked from taking part by a Tory whip, who claimed he had been snoozing earlier on - and had to be woken by a member of Lords staff. The former postal workers’ union leader protested he was “not now” asleep. According to Hansard, he protested: “I was not…”.It is not the first time someone has been accused of being asleep in Parliament, and previously some of those accused have insisted they were awake.MPs with hearing problems, for example, have been seen listening to speakers that are embedded in seats, while shutting their eyes to concentrate. But it is rare for one person in Parliament to directly accuse another of snoozing on the job.

The latest available data from the Department for Education shows % of children - or , pupils - had a reading ability below their expected ability at the end of Key Stage  in . The number of youngsters struggling at the end of primary school had increased, compared to % - or , pupils - the previous year. Official figures, revealed by Schools Minister Robin Walker in a written parliamentary question, show the figure rose to above % in some constituencies such as Leeds Central, Peterborough and Dudley North.Mr Walker said no data was recorded for academic years   or   due to the impact of the COVID- outbreak.The Liberal Democrats said the data laid bare the reading crisis in schools - and warned it could be the tip of the iceberg after children suffered major disruption to their schooling during the pandemic. MPs warned last week that poorer pupils could be up to eight months behind at school after the pandemic and the Governmentaposs catch-up plans are failing to reach them.The Commons Education Committee said repeated school closures had a disastrous impact on childrenaposs education, with disadvantaged kids worst hit by months out of the classroom. Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: These figures reveal a reading crisis in our schools and they’re just the tip of the iceberg. The pandemic has had a huge effect on our children, and with reading ages already below standards for many before the crisis, the case now could be terrible for thousands of children across the country.  “Parents, teachers and pupils have not had a fair deal throughout this pandemic, no child should leave primary school unable to read at the standard level for their age - they need a chance to catch up. The party called for an urgent review into reading standards across the country and for ministers to pump more cash into catch-up programmes. The Government has announced £ billion in funding to help children catch up on lost learning over the pandemic - which has been criticised for falling short of the £ billion demanded by Boris Johnsonaposs education recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We are committed to raising literacy standards and our ambitious recovery plan is helping pupils make up for learning lost during the pandemic. Backed by £ billion, we are rolling out high-quality tutoring – which has seen a million courses started by pupils so far – alongside world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, and additional funding for schools.

Waffle is pampered for the show ring with an hour-long wash and blow dry, using an organic, cruelty-free shampoo.Breeder Michael Gadsby, whose partner Tom Isherwood grooms Toy Poodle Waffle, said: “It takes about an hour shampooing and blow-drying him. “It takes a lot longer than humans because they’ve got more hair. Waffle goes to sleep while being blow-dried. He’s very chilled, it’s therapeutic. They’re not like a child in a beauty pageant, being terrorised by a mother.”Waffle – kennel name Ch Afterglow Agent Orange – stole the show, drawing cheers from the Crufts crowd as he cheekily cocked a leg during the final parade at Birmingham NEC on Sunday. He was named Reserve Champion, beaten to the Best in Show title by a flat-coated retriever called Baxer. Waffle, from Preston, Lancs, celebrated his runner-up position at the aftershow party with “two British bangers”, said Michael. And yesterday Waffle was looking forward to letting his hair down with a muddy walk on the beach. Michael said: “I know he looks like he’s pampered to death, but he’s not. “Between shows, his hair is pulled back into pigtails with rubber bands. He goes on Blackpool beach, he gets muddy. He doesn’t have particularly expensive tastes, he’s just happy running around. He doesn’t need expensive toys – he loves a stick.” But his shampoo for show time is from Plush Puppy, an Australian brand with a £ bottle in its range. Michael said: “It’s a lovely shampoo that suits his hair, and he has conditioner. “If you’ve a lovely thick coat, it’s much easier to scissor and look fantastic.”  At just a year old, Waffle can still be a “little terror” at times, but his little accident in the ring is not thought to have cost him the title. Michael said: “They’re going to behave like dogs.” Waffle’s rightful owner is Michael and Tom’s good friend Trish, and he willto her, and her kids and grandchildren, when his show days are over. Michael said: “He won’t have a long career, but he’ll be shown this year. “Then he’ll go back to the kids, back to being Waffle. He’s such a funny little dog. That personality and happiness is really infectious – he makes you smile. “At the moment there’s a lot of doom and gloom, he’s a little bit of light relief. He’s like a little ginger cloud.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DogsCrufts\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The study of , adults found a further % weren’t aware the day falls in April. It emerged one in  thought St George saved England from the plague, while the same percentage thought he was King of England. A third of adults are more likely to celebrate St Patrick’s Day over St George’s – although knowledge of this event is also limited. Researchers found % think St Patrick was a leprechaun, while others even believe he discovered Guinness. A fth of those polled think he banished snakes from Ireland, while one in  are sure he was a fictional character from a popular Irish book. But despite the confusion, almost halfconsider themselves very patriotic – while % admit they use any excuse to party.  A spokesman for Lottoland, which carried out the study to celebrate this week’s St. Patrick’s Day-themed Irish Lotto draw, said: “It is surprising how little Brits know about their own or their near neighbours’ history – but funny how determined they are to celebrate it anyway. “Despite St Patrick’s Day being so popular throughout the UK, it’s strange to see how little Brits know about the day itself, other than the fact people typically dress in green and have a few pints of Guinness. “There are many blurred lines when it comes to the history of our saints in these islands as it all happened thousands of years ago, but people definitely need to research the likes of St George.”The study also found over halfweren’t sureBritish saints were real or fictional, with a further % convinced they are made up. And almost a quarter were unsure who the patron saint of Ireland is, despite one in  of those surveyed being Northern Irish themselves. Furthermore, % – including one in five Welsh people surveyed – don’t know when St David’s day should be celebrated. While % – more than half of whom were Scottish – couldn’t name the month St Andrew’s Day take place. As many as % donapost even know why patron saints are celebrated, although half love to mark the days anyway. More than one in four are also unsure whether any patron saints live in the present day – although St David died most recently, in the year AD. The poll, conducted via OnePoll, found the most popular things to do on St Patrick’s Day are to visit an Irish puband drink Guinness . Others celebrate by listening to Irish musicand dressing up in green . The spokesman from Lottoland added: “It’s hardly a surprise that so many love going to an Irish pub with a pint of Guinness to celebrate St Patrick’s Day. “No matter how little Brits may know about these signicant days, itaposs great to see there is still an element of patriotism still engrained in our culture.”Brits can place a bet on the Special St Patrickaposs Day £ €million jackpot, that will take place March  and March , by visiting here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Irish LottoSt Georges DaySt Patricks DaySt Davids DaySt Andrews DayLottoland\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A loving uncle, not just to his three nephews but also to his friendsapos children too. His silliness, sense of adventure and love of science and nature made him such a fun uncle to spend time with.

He also leaves behind a devastated sister and sister-in-law, and their two young boys, who will miss out on all of the fun and silly memories that they should have created with him. But his close friends were his family too and he was always there for them when they needed him. They are all now shocked and broken by Ianaposs death. In this terrible time we have really appreciated the warmth of so many people who have come together to support us. The family added: No one ever imagines losing someone in this terrible way, so senseless and needlessly. A hole has been created in our lives that can never be filled but the love and support we have received is helping us begin to try to find a way to work through this awful tragedy. Ian was reportedly attacked after accidentally bumping into a gang of youths outside the supermarket. In total  people, from the south Birmingham area, were arrested in connection with the attack. One of the boys was charged with murder while three faced further questioning and seven were released to face no further action.

Getting a good nightaposs sleep can be a challenge at the best of times, but during the last two years, many of us have found it especially dficult as our normal circumstances drastically changed. According to sleep behaviour expert James Wilson, we’re supposed to spend a third of our lives asleep, so when we struggle, the bedroom can feel like a prison. While there certainly isnapost a one-size-fits-all solution to sleep, we decided to testsleep sprays could help you drt off calmly. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here  The reviews of the sprays seem impressive - with some customers claiming they slept more peacefully than they ever had before. Personally, Iaposm a bit dubious but willing to try. Two years of working from my bedroom have left me struggling to nod off, with no boundaries between work and sleep times.But paradoxically, the more I worry about sleep, the less I get - and not getting enough hours can have a serious impact long term. Dr Rangan Chatterjee, GP and author of The Stress Solution, has previously warned it can lead to poor concentration and increased stress. He added: But a chronic lack of sleep can also lead to type  diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even Alzheimeraposs disease. I tried out three kits - from This Works, Sanctuary Spa and Aroma Active - and one sent me straight back to sleep on a restless night. This Works Choose Sleep £  This sleep spray is scented with relaxing lavender, vetiver and chamomile. The marketing material quotes an independent survey showing that per cent who used it slept better This little pack also includes a aposstress-bustingapos formula of eucalyptus, frankincense and lavender to apply to your pulse points. My thoughts: Itaposs a lovely touch to have the pillow spray and pulse point oil, it makes it feel like a luxurious experience. The spray smells lovely but doesnapost stay on my pillow long, which is a shame. Iaposm unconvinced by the independent testing claim - itaposs a survey, not science. There is some research however showing inhaling these scented oils can help reduce anxiety. I canapost say I notice I sleep better after a few weeks of usage but I donapost suffer from my normal frantic dreams, which does leave me feeling like Iaposve slept better.   Sanctuary Spa Wellness Sleep Mist £  This claims to be a multi-purpose product that you can apply to your face and pillow. The blurb says the spray contains a cocktail of nourishing ingredients to help condition and protect the visage including hyaluronic acid and the scents of jasmine, patchouli and frankincense. My thoughts: I donapost love the idea of a multi-purpose product for my face and pillow. If Iaposm planning to use it on my skin, it feels wasteful to spray it on my pillow too. But for others - that might be a massive plus, as inevitably anything youaposve sprayed on your pillow is inevitably being absorbed into your skin. The spray smells lovely, and while I canapost say it improved my sleep, I think it relaxed me which is still helpful. But the scent doesnapost linger, and Iaposd prefer a product with more staying power.   Aroma Active Sleep Mist £  This spray contains a blend of lavender, valerian and ylang-ylang, with the marketing blurb saying it is combined with buddha wood and added hops help to aid sleep. My thoughts: This was an absolute game-changer for me, I slept better than I had in a long time while testing this product. One night a noisy car outside wakes me up and I spritz my pillow with Aromaaposs spray – perhaps it’s purely psychosomatic but I fell asleep again straight away. Overall, it delivers one of the best nights sleep I think Iaposve ever had Itaposs got a lovely natural smell that lingers and fills the room - with no synthetic notes ruining the product.   Review For me, there is a clear winner - the Aroma sleep spray. Finding out what can help you sleep is such a personal thing, and it can be dficult to find what works. So Iaposm thrilled to find a cheap product to aid me on nights I find myself tossing and turning into the wee hours. If youaposre looking for help on sleep, check out the NHS advice here.

Her three-year-old daughter Clover is among up to % of epileptic children who don’t respond to conventional pharmaceutical drugs. Clover began having hundreds of seizures a week at just three months old and was diagnosed with Aicardi syndrome, a rare genetic condition. She was put on heavy-duty steroids that caused adrenal insufficiency and stopped her body fighting even the smallest infection. Her day trips were all to AE rather than playgrounds, her future uncertain. “It was terrying,” says bookkeeper Emily, , who lives with Clover and husband Spencer, a landscape gardener, in Trowbridge, Wiltshire.  “You spend every day thinking your child will die. We were in and out of hospital all the time. It was awful.” Everything changed for Clover when, in , she received a private prescription for “whole plant” cannabis oil, which contains the full cannabinoid, terpene and flavonoid profile extracted from cannabis flowers, including psychoactive THC. “The results have been incredible,” says Emily. “Clover now has only one or two seizures a week and sometimes goes up to  days with none at all. She can play normally and I canto work. It has been le changing.” Along with  other children also taking whole plant cannabis oil for severe epilepsy, Clover was enrolled in a study in  carried out by the non-profit independent research body Drug Science. The findings from the two-year study, announced at a House of Lords medical cannabis conference last month, revealed an % reduction in seizure frequency, with three children in the group entirely free from seizures, thanks to the oil. This astonishing result far surpasses that of any other epileptic drug available. While many of those carry serious side effects, the main risks of using cannabis have been identied as building up tolerance, fatigue and diarrhoea. Children do not get “high” from the medicine. The cannabis study, led by Professor David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist – which looks into the effects of drugs on the brain – also indicated a % likelihood of patients with severe treatment-resistant epilepsy responding positively. Rayyan Zafar, who worked on the trial, says: “These children are severely unwell, often having hundreds of seizures a day, which causes serious developmental delays. “We saw a huge improvement in overall quality of le. The children were able to rehabilitate back into their daily routine –to school.” Additionally, they were able to reduce an average of eight pharmaceutical anti-epileptic drugs to just one after using the oil. These remarkable results bolster the growing body of evidence on the effectiveness and safety of whole plant medical cannabis treatment, with , industry-funded studies currently underway in the UK alone.  Professor Nutt says: “Medical cannabis is probably the most important advance in medicine in recent years, because of its safety and wide applicability to many dferent disorders. It’s often found to be more effective than other medicines, offering superior pain control and helping to signicantly reduce the use of opioid painkillers among patients.” Despite its legalisation in , only three children have been given prescriptions for Clover’s le-changing whole plant oil on the NHS. All other patients have to fund their treatment themselves, at an average cost of £ per month. As a result, many families are having to sell their homes, take out loans and crowdfund to keep their children alive. “We have to pay £, a month for the privilege,” says Emily, who fundraises via JustGiving and relies on friends and family to contribute to Clover’s medication fees. “I don’t understand how this could be considered safe and effective for three children, but not for others.” Yet experts believe the oil would ultimately save the NHS money. “You could introduce cannabis treatment at no additional cost,” says neurologist and medical cannabis expert Professor Mike Barnes. “Widening NHS access to cannabis would reduce hospital stays, medicines, nursing time, physio, ICU costs and opioids, for starters.” There are many barriers that stand in the way. These include a lack of training for doctors on cannabis as a medicine, a lack of framework for prescribing and funding and a shortage of randomised control trials. A spokesperson for NICE says: “Until there is clear evidence of the safety and effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products, specialist doctors need to consider inidual patient circumstances, clinical condition and need, and weigh up with the patient or carer relative risks and benefits in choosing treatments.” Matt Hughes, dad to four-year-old Charlie and founder of patient support group MedCan, pays £ a month for his son’s prescription. Charlie was diagnosed with West Syndrome, an epileptic condition that causes him to suffer up to  spasms per day, when he was  weeks old. IT manager Matt, , says it’s devastating to know his little boy’s health is entirely dependent on the family’s financial situation. “We’ve had to sell our home to afford Charlie’s prescription, which he needs to survive,” says Matt, from Norwich. “He’s finally stable thanks to cannabis, but we don’t know how we’ll pay for it long term. Families are fighting every day to keep their children alive. We need this to be available on the NHS now.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mike BarnesNiceJustGivingNHSHouse of LordsHospitalsPrescriptionsPoliticsHealth\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite her devastation at the officer’s brutal killing just four weeks after the couple’s wedding, Lissie, , added she still hopes to find happiness. Describing the tragedy as “a blur of heart-wrenching pain”, she said: “We had gone from the happiest day of our lives to the worst in such a short space of time. “I don’t think I will ever fully come to terms with Andrew’s death, such an unexpected and shocking change to my le and the future we planned. “But I plan to be grateful for every moment and live how Andrew would want me to – to be happy and listen to my heart.” On Tuesday, ITV will screen documentary The Killing of PC Harper: A Widow’s Fight for Justice where Sir Trevor McDonald meets Lissie in her home in Wallingford, Oxon, to discuss the death.The officer, , was dragged along a road for more than a mile as he tried to stop a gang’s getaway car in August . Sir Trevor charts the probe that put the killers behind bars and talks to Lissie about her campaign for Harper’s Law. The initiative was launched after three teenagers accused of Andrew’s murder were instead found guilty of manslaughter. It aims to ensure anyone convicted of killing an emergency services worker while committing a crime is jailed for le. The measure has been included in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to become law in the next few months. Lissie said: “I want to create something Andrew would be proud of. “Otherwise, it’s just a disgraceful waste of an amazing person’s le.  “There are no deterrents in our country for taking the lives of people who work tirelessly to protect the public. This needed to change.” Andrew was killed when he tackled Henry Long, , Albert Bowers, , and Jesse Cole, , as they towed a stolen quad bike along a Berkshire lane.The Thames Valley Police officer got entangled in a rope as they drove off but the gang said they did not know he was there. Colleagues initially mistook his body for a “bloodied deer carcass”. Andrew died at the scene. Long was jailed for  years while the others were caged for  years. Lissie recalled the cheering of the defendants’ families at the verdict as “a kick in the gut”. Admitting her grief is exhausting, she said of her campaign: “I will push, push until we get there, because I am doing it for Andrew, but I am also doing it for other emergency workers’ families, so in the future they won’t have to see this same kind of injustice.” The Killing of PC Harper: A Widow’s Fight for Justice will air on ITV, Tuesday night at pm Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DocumentariesMarriageLe sentenceCrimeBurglaryPC Andrew Harper\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the Duchess of Cambridgeaposs younger sister had a slightly unusual idea when it came to the seating plan. Pippa married James Matthew in a stunning ceremony on May , , at St Markaposs Church in Englefield with their nephew Prince George and niece Princess Charlotte as the pageboy and bridesmaid.Following the ceremony, the  guests made their way to Bucklebury Village Hall, where they parked their cars ahead of the evening celebrations. They were then driven to Pippaaposs parentsapos estate - but not before each guest had their photo ID checked and their own password to get in.

When they arrived, they were greeted by a ft glass marquee in the garden, which had been decorated in an enchanted forest theme.  Guests took part in a number of fun games and watched an excellent light show before they were served food and drink including mini haggis, deer carpaccio, langoustine claws and asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. But when it was time to sit down to eat, guests were surprised to discover that Pippa hadnapost followed a conventional seating plan chart. Instead, she set a rule that they werenapost allowed to sit with their other halves.Although this is quite unusual, it does allow guests to get to know each other.According to Harpers Bazaar, the etiquette guide Debretts, It is up to the host to decide whether husbands and wives are to be seated together or apart at formal events. This meant that despite travelling , miles across the pond, Meghan Markle wasnapost allowed to sit with Prince Harry.But, it turns out that Meghan almost didnapost get an invite at all. Meghan and Harry hadnapost been together for too long when Pippa and James got married, so there was a lot of media attention on them. This worried Pippa as she feared that it would overshadow her big day. In their book Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, claim that Meghan had planned to attend the full day, and even bought her outfit, but the decision was made that she skip it. So Harry went to the ceremony by himself, leaving Meghan at another wedding guestaposs Airbnb before they met up later to go to the reception together.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

As they arrived, the royals greeted each other with hugs and kisses. Kate looked resplendent in royal blue and was seen chatting with her father-in-law. The Commonwealth, affectionately known as the “family of nations”, has played an important role throughout the Queenaposs reign, and she takes a special interest in the institution. Highlights of the service at Westminster Abbey, also attended Princess Alexandra, included an address by former archbishop Lord Sentamu, a reflection by young Tongan leader Elizabeth Kite and special musical performances from Emeli Sande and Mica Paris.The service would have been the Queen’s first major public appearance since reaching her Platinum Jubilee milestone in February. But on Friday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “After discussing the arrangements with the royal household, the Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey on Monday.“The Queen will continue with other planned engagements, including in-person audiences, in the week ahead.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. She last missed the service nine years ago, in , while recovering from a nasty bout of gastroenteritis. Before that, the Queen had not been absent from a Commonwealth Day observance service for  years, the last time being when she had flu in . However, earlier this afternoon, she did issue her annual Commonwealth Day message, where she renewed her vow of dedicating her le to service. Her decision not to attend the service was taken with her most trusted advisors and is understood to be related to her comfort travelling the -mile journey from Windsor Castle to London and sitting through the event, rather than a specic illness. A royal source said: “The Queen is very aware that with the passage of time must come an awareness of one’s own frailties and we are very much in that moment.“The Queen is still utterly determined to serve to the maximum extent that she can and the renewal of her vow, dedicating her le service, is one that Her Majesty takes incredibly seriously.”Commonwealth Day has not been celebrated in person since  when the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made their last public appearance with senior members of the royal family before moving to North America.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Camilla, Duchess of CornwallKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeThe QueenPrince Charles, Prince of WalesCommonwealthRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mysterious marks have appeared on properties in Stoke-on-Trent and are similar to others that have been discovered where.People have been warned by police to look out for the markings which can also be used by utility firms to inform workers of a problemaposs whereabouts. But they are also used by burglars to suggest a property is vacant or to indicatesomeone is at home. There have been previous reports where the symbols were being used to flag up expensive dogs or property at a house, reports Stoke on Trent Live.  They have raised concern for some time and in  West Yorkshire Police shared an image of the signs people should look out for. Other Forces including County Durham, Lanarkshire and Devon and Cornwall have also highlighted the issue. StaffordshireLive reports mum Libby Dallimore,  was concerned about the marks. She said: We have an O and Vl outside our house and the neighbours have X X.No dogs either side so assuming itaposs not to do with potential dog-napping but perhaps targeting for burglaries.Similar markings spotted on the terrace houses further down. While the symbols may not be cause for concern, they should be reported to Staffordshire Police on the non-emergency  number. Elsewhere in the country, they have been dubbed the Da Pinci Code with signs for nothing worth stealing, wealthy and good target.  A triangle symbol is used to show a single woman lives in the property on her own, or vertical lines could imply a house has obvious valuables inside.Also keep an eye out for letters ‘M’ which tells other burglars to strike the morning, whereas ‘N’ means a night-time intrusion. The Safeguarding Hub - which shares home protection advice and information across the UK - previously said: Between us, we have a fairly extensive knowledge of burglary.We have spent many hours speaking to distraught victims, visiting crime scenes and dealing with burglars.We have actually seen and experienced these symbols being used by criminals.This is not to say that this is a common practice between bands of thieves, for most burglars work alone. We do not want to scaremonger and we can say confidentially that the use of these symbols is very rare.But,you are a caregiver to an elderly or vulnerable person and spot strange marks outside their home, do you really want to dismiss it out of hand without just ensuring that the symbol is legitimate  Security firm Keytek has also highlighted the issue saying: These ‘robbery markings’ or ‘burglar signals’ are basic sketches and forms that are supposedly used as a ‘code’ to determine whether a house is worth targeting. These illustrations are also supposed to indicate to other thieves what type of person lives at the property, such as whether the residents are vulnerable, elderly, or live in a single-family home. It added: Chalk is the main material burglars use as it is easily removed and not as noticeable as materials such as spray paint markings outside the house.As well as burglar chalk signs, burglars mark houses with almost anything they can it may be a small blob of paint or a piece of string tied around a lamppost!  White and blue spray paint markings outside the house are the most common colours used by burglars.Make sure you keep an eye out for both colour pains to avoid getting burgled! There was also a stint in  mainly found in Dublin where burglars would place clear tape over the keyholes on the exterior access doors.If the tape is left intact for the next couple of days they would know the house is currently vacant! What to doyouaposve been burgled  If you come home one day to find that you yourself have been burgled, there are a couple of steps you must take: Don’t touch anything – although you might want to figure out what has been taken, it could potentially destroy fingerprint or DNA evidence. Don’t walk around the house – again, intruders might have left footwear marks on the floor which crime scene investigators will want to look into If the intruder has left anything behindagain, leave it where it is and noty the officer when they arrive. You’ll be asked to give a police statement as well as any witnesses that were present at the time. The police will then conduct door to door enquiries in the area, take photographs of your house to find out a potential point of entry. Theyaposll also look into any CCTV footage in the area and look for any DNA evidence in your home to help determine the culprit.

Physicists say the storm is likely to happen in the next couple of weeks. These predictions have been made based on data collected from NASA and the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . The NOAA has predicted there is an  per cent chance of the storm will hit as soon as today. The chances of the storm hitting the UK is  per cent.However, Dr Tamitha Skov, a space weather physicist, says the storm is already here.A solar blast, also known as a Coronal Mass Injection , are very common and not all of them travel towards the Earth, but when they do - they have the power to be disruptive. Some flares can reach speeds of between km-,km a second, according to the US Space Weather Prediction Center .People across the world may be able to see the Aurora, a light show that is often seen in high latitude areas, this is expected to be seen further towards the equator during the storm. Issues can also be expected for amateur radio and GPS systems, particularly near dawn and dusk.  Dr Skov tweeted yesterday: Direct Hit! NOAA  NASA prediction models show solar storm to hit Earth between : and : UTC on March . Impact should be strong! Expect aurora deep into mid-latitudes, amateur radio  GPS reception issues, especially near dawn dusk, and on Earthaposs nightside! She added on Monday morning: Solarstorm  Aurora -day Outlook: Busy week with a triple threat! A big solar storm is coming sandwiched between a glancing blow from a previous solar storm and some fast solar wind. A relatively weak C-class solar flare blasted from the earth-facing side of the Sun on Thursday last week.  While Dr Tony Phillips of spaceweather stated that these flares are usually unremarkable, this one lasted for nearly  hours. Coronal Mass Ejectionsare powerful eruptions of plasma on the Sunaposs surface. Billions of tons of material are lted off the surface and can explode away from the Sun with the force of around  million nuclear explosions. Scientists donapost quite yet understand what causes CMEaposs, but do believe that it is something to do with the Sunaposs magnetic field. EarthSky.org explained: Because the sun is a fluid, turbulence tends to twist the magnetic field into complex contortions. Twist the field too much, and it kinks, much like a phone cord or toy Slinky. These kinks snap the magnetic field and can potentially drive vast amounts of plasma into space.

After a weekend of mixed weather with wind and rain, a spell of more settled conditions is set for the UK this week which started with some sunny spells on Monday.And it is likely to be warmer again on Tuesday especially in the south of the UK where temperatures could get into the mid-teens. A high pressure front is moving north bringing the warmer conditions but how warm it gets depends on when it meets a low pressure that is coming from the north west. On Tuesday morning it could drop as low as -C in central England and it will be low single figures around the UK.  BBC weather forecaster Matt Taylor said: A touch of frost is possible just about anywhere but a bright enough start for many, a few isolated showers through East Anglia and the Midlands, drting their way northwards through Yorkshire during the day.Much of England and Wales ying amounts of sunshine, the best of which will be in the morning.

The fast-food chain has told how it plans to serve a % meat-free menu by  - but will customers be interested. The Mirror visited the restaurant today, with one meat-eater and vegetarian in tow to review the limited menu, which is available until April . The fast-food chain has even said it will be keeping an eye on the most popular items on the menu, with a view to making some of them nationally available in the future. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Other options include the Vegan Nugget Burger, a Plant-based Double Cheeezeburger, as well as sides Vegan Chilli Cheeeze Bites.  Our review Clearly, thereaposs a massive demand for vegan products, as we rock up to find a queue of hungry customers snaking around busy Leicester Square on Monday afternoon. Waiting patiently in line, Nicola Jones, from Chichester who turned vegan four years ago after -years as a vegetarian. She told the Mirror: aposWe came up to London for the weekend, saw this and knew that we had to try it.The fact itaposs all meat-free, thataposs really reassuring as you know it wonapost be contaminated. We were surprised to see it so thought we had to support it. Meanwhile, Eleisha Kennedy, who has been a vegan for six years, said she was intrigued by the range on offer despite not being a self-professed fast food fan. She said: My friend told me it was happening so I thought Iaposd nip over from work out of curiosity. I think choices are so much better now, when I turned vegan, Iaposd have to be content with chips and salad. I donapost eat a lot of fast food and Iaposm not too keen on those companies, but itaposs a little treat. Itaposs mostly curiosity.Iaposm most excited about the nuggets, as who doesnapost like a chicken nugget  Tourist Kathy Alvrez, who was visiting from Calornia, said she was always intrigued to try the new vegan fare. She said: I wanted to support this launch, Iaposve been vegan for ten years and menus have changed a lot. Iaposm keen to try a milkshake and chicken nuggets. I would like to try it all. Itaposs nice not having to wonderitaposs actually vegan. Iaposm pretty relaxed but itaposs good to know that itaposs all safe to eat. Meat-eater Rosaleen Fenton and vegetarian Zahra Khaliq visited the new spot - and left seriously impressed Chilli Cheeze Bites Zahra: I can’t tell that the cheese is vegan, it melts beautully and tastes just like the regular chilli cheese bites that you’ll find in regular chicken shops dotted around the UK. It has a slightly spicy kick and salty aftertaste. Rosie: I am stunned by the revelation that vegan cheese can be melty, delicious and have a consistency that doesnapost leave me wanting to vomit. These are a total triumph. The batter is lovely and thin, and it actually has a slightly spicy kick, unlike most high-street products with chilli in it. Vegan Nuggets Zahra: These are very convincing, and similar in style to the Quorn veggie nuggets and McDonald’s chicken nuggets. They have a crispy outer layer, texture and taste very similar to that of a regular chicken nugget, although they have a slight aftertaste of oil. Rosie: The humble chicken nugget could happily disappear off the shelves forever, and I donapost think most meat-eaters would notice. These are delicious, with a nice crispy batter. Perfect to pair with a nice spicy or sweet sauce for dipping. Cheeze  Bakon Whopper Zahra: The tastes just like beef, while the bacon is smoky and tastes very similar to real bacon. When you combine the salad, sauces, bacon and burger patty, it tastes just like a regular beef burger, the ying flavours and textures work very well together Rosie: This was the burger I had the lowest expectations for, but actually it turned out to be my favourite. A total triumph. The aposbakonapos had a nice smoky flavour, while the cheeze was distinctively cheese-like. I would happilyjust to eat this burger.  . Katsu Chilli Whopper Zahra: The blander option of the menu - could be betterit had more of a iety of flavours and textures like the cheese and bacon whopper. Lacks freshnessand was a little burnt, with an aftertaste. Rosie: This wasnapost my favourite. Unlike a meat patty, the vegan burger didnapost hold up that well to being chargrilled. The curry sauce is tasty, but I agree with Zahra, it is crying out for some herbs and crunchy greens, possibly in a zingy dressing. A little bit cloying.Vegan Royale  Zahra: This is supposed to imitate the taste of chicken, the patty is quite flat and the texture is not overly similar to chicken, but overall it is still tasty!

Helena Monk, , was parked on a side road eating the burger after going for dinner with a friend. She says she panicked when she saw the man walk towards her pink Fiat  car and drove onto a country road to get away from him.Police stopped her when they spotted her swerving around the carriageway with an internal light still switched on,Manchester Evening News reports.Stockport Magistrates Court heard how tests showed she was almost double the legal drink-drive limit. Monk, who lives in Hale, admitted drink driving and was banned from the roads for  months. She has initially applied for a special reasons hearing in which drink drivers cite exceptional hardship in an attempt to dodge a driving ban.  The incident happened on July  last year at .pm around  miles from Monkaposs flat, when police spotted her driving through the village of Mottram St Andrew near Alderley Edge. It was claimed Monk, who works as a textile designer and a recruitment agent, had been out for a meal and had dropped off her friend - but stopped at McDonaldaposs on her way home. She then pulled over at a nearby pub to eat it before setting off again. Prosecutor Peter Conroy said: A police constable on patrol described the defendant as swerving from side to side in the road. There was an internal light on in the car. The officer conducted checks on her number plate and used his emergency equipment to stop her. aposaposThe defendant pulled over and he could smell alcohol on her breath and could tell she was intoxicated.She then failed a roadside breath test and was arrested being taken to Middlewich custody suite. She was compliant with police throughout. There were no other passengers in the car and conditions were good, it was late at night. In mitigation defence lawyer James Street, who specialises in aposaposexceptional hardshipaposapos cases, said: My client was someone of previous good character and she has now lost that. She accepts she will now be disqualied and it will have a signicant impact on her in terms of circumstances. aposaposShe had been out for a meal and a drink and then dropped her friend off at their home, where she has had another drink.It is probably that drink which has put her over the legal limit. She was hungry later on and drove to McDonald’s to get a burger.She then started to drive off and realised it may be dficult to eat a burger whilst driving. aposaposShe parked down the side lane of the pub and noticed someone approaching behind her.She was a single woman in a car and was concerned. She felt threatened because a male was behind her, so she took the decision to drive off onto the main road and that is when the police saw her and she pulled into a side road and co-operated. Mr Street told the court his client normally works as a recruitment agent but due to lockdown, is currently not in work. He added: She is going to be much more limited in her ability now to find work after losing her license because of this. Monk was also ordered to pay a fine of £ and ordered to pay £ costs plus a £ victim surcharge.

Reflecting on some of the harsh comments sheaposs previously received, Patricia said: Back when I started posting my makeup videos and people called me ugly or would say aposwhat’s wrong with your face apos, they then called me a Catfish and I knew what that was, but that wasn’t my mission. I wanted to share my before and after videos, because for so long, those words cut so much and you get into depression until you can finally get up and turn those negative comments into something bittersweet. So that day, I decided to make that video to show them so yeah, I guess I am a Catfish! Words stopped hurting me and my TikTok Tribe fans backed me up because they know what I’ve been through!Patricia posted her aposcatfishapos video on September , , showing a before and after transformation, from natural hair and bare face to full make-up and styled hair. One baffled follower refused to believe they were even looking at the same person, declaring that it was not even the same girl, while another gasped, How did she go from -year-old to -year-old  Make-up is the true CAP, Be careful men. A third person wrote: So many people are saying itaposs not the same girl, it is she has the same tattoo on her right arm. You are beautul with or without makeup by the way! Considering the reaction to her vid, Patricia remarked: There is no such thing as perfect, let’s be real, we all have skin texture and this is so surreal that we’d all think we are made of robots or something because we are not. Makeup is not illegal, we enhance our beauty and we all are artistic so why take the fun out of that  I can go from a Simple makeup look to dramatic sometimes so the comments from my supporters have my back, they still do till this day.

The “potato” was dug up by Colin and Donna Craig-Brown, from New Zealand’ s Waikato region, last August. They suspected ‘Dug’ to be the world’s biggest spud and were waiting to hear back from Guiness World Records to seetheir “potato was actually the world’s heaviest, after sending a sample of the UK for DNA testing. But according to an email from Guinness World Records received by the couple on Sunday, the Science  Advice for Scottish Agriculture SASA found the DNA sample taken showed the specimen was not a potato.Instead, the .kg tuber is a type of gourd. For that reason, the Craig-Brown’s application for the World Records was disqualied.  Speaking to Stuff on Monday, Colin said he was “disappointed”. “Itaposs been a real roller-coaster of potato-rama,” he said. We hopped on the roller-coaster eyes wide open and enjoyed the ride and this was the last real twist.” Colin said he was “trying to rationalise” how the confusion had happened. The only logical explanation he could think of, he said, wasthe seedling he purchased was crossbred with a gourd and a cucumber.  Speaking to Stuff last year shortly after the discovery of the monstrous tuber, Colin said the “potato” was their “happy little mistake of nature”. It’s a hideous looking creature,” Colin had said. “It’s the sort of thing that only a mother could love.” The couple think the potato is self-sown and could have been growing for a couple of years or more. Whilst they awaited confirmation to seeDoug will take his place in the annals of history, they have built a small cart to tow the potato around town and show it off.  Speaking now of the confusion, Colin said it was a mystery to him why it grew so big, and why it tasted and looked like a potato. “If it quacks like a duck, swims like a duck and has feathers on it, then it must be a duck. “But nah – this one turned out to be a turkey.” Colin said his hopes hadn’t been crushed completely. He was now inspired to “really get stuck in” growing his potatoes. “I’m really gonna give it my all and have a go at growing the biggest potato in the world,” he said. The current heaviest potato was found in Britain in  and weight only just under kg, far less than Doug.

The traffickers can also be seen hoisting terried and screaming dogs from an underground pit as they are repeatedly bludgeoned across the face and head. Other scenes at the markets show cages of dogs huddling together as nearby the leless bodies of other dogs are blowtorched to remove their fur for sale to customers. Some dogs being blowtorched are visibly still alive during the ordeal.Dog and cat meat can be seen being sold alongside bush meat including bats, snakes and wild boar in scenes similar to those found at Wuhan, China where the SARS-CoV- virus is believed to have originated, risking public health. The majority of Indonesia’s Muslim population do not eat dog meat but it is popular in areas like Sulawesi, where it is an inexpensive delicacy. A dish containing dog meat can be bought at a market for around , – , IDR which is roughly , the same price as a cup of coffee. Campaigners say the low price point helps to keep the cruelty going at the scale exposed by the investigation. Deadly rabies – a zoonotic disease endemic throughout Sulawesi – has also been linked to Asia’s dog meat trade by the World Health Organisation. Across Indonesia, an estimated one million dogs are killed for their meat annually. While a crackdown on the trade is being seen in parts of Indonesia such as Central Java, authorities in Sulawesi – a , square mile island with a population of nearly million people - have failed to act. Some dogs are trafficked from as far away as Makassar, South Sulawesiaposs capital, a -hour gruelling journey covering , miles.  An investigator for DMFI - which comprises local campaigners Jakarta Animal Aid Network and Animals Friends Jogja, and international groups Humane Society International, Four Paws and Animals Asia – infiltrated gangs who stole an estimated , pet and roaming dogs every month from villages. They are then sold by traffickers to kill and sell for meat at local restaurants and at wet markets such as Langowan, Tomohon and Kawangkoan in the north. Some dogs are trafficked from as far away as Makassar, South Sulawesiaposs capital, a -hour gruelling journey covering , miles. Lola Webber, End Dog Meat campaigns director at Humane Society International, said: “This is some of the worst animal cruelty we have seen -- gangs and traders stealing and bludgeoning thousands of terried, screaming dogs every month from villages, many beloved family companions. “They are torn away and abused by these criminals in broad daylight, scared and helpless. All of this to be sold for their meat in restaurants and at wet markets on display alongside bats, snakes and wild boar. As shocking as our investigation is, it’s just a snapshot of the horrying scale of this trade. “Despite the serious public health risks associated with these markets, Sulawesi’s roughly  traditional markets are still operating business as usual.With Indonesia still in the grip of the COVID- pandemic, with its origins in wildle wet markets in China just the same as we see in North Sulawesi, it is a matter of urgency that President Widodo take action immediately to stop this dangerous and illegal trade.” The DMFI investigator, who is not being named for his own safety, said: “The scale of the dog meat trade was really surprising. Thieves are stealing dogs from all over the island before selling them to the traders who warehouse them until they have enough to take to market. “Mentally, this was a harrowing mission because every day I could see how utterly terried and traumatised these poor dogs were. All around them, they witness other dogs being dragged by the neck, beaten over the head, thrown around violently. They would tremble in fear when approached. “Like me, the vast majority of Indonesians will be sickened by what I saw. This trade brings shame on Indonesia.” Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo now faces fresh pressure to shut down the country’s brutal dog meat trade after sickening scenes reveals horric animal cruelty. After viewing the footage, Lord Goldsmith, minister for animal welfare said: This footage is so deeply shocking. I have written to the ambassador urging the government of Indonesia to take stronger steps to stop this appalling cruelty The DMFI is now calling for immediate action to crack down on the trade. In November last year campaigners joined Sukoharjo police in Java on a sting operation at an illegal dog slaughterhouse that saw more than  dogs rescued.The dog meat trade: The facts Opinion polls show that only a small minority of Indonesia’s populationconsume dog meat and only a very small number of those involved in the trade rely on dog meat as their main source of income. Although demand for dog meat is higher in Sulawesi than the rest of Indonesia, latest opinion polling by Ninconfirms that only % of Sulawesians consume dogs. Dog meat is mostly eaten by certain ethnic groups such as the Minahasa people of North Sulawesi where there are  markets collectively selling around  live and slaughtered dogs per day, amounting to more than , dogs every year. In  President Joko Widodo received a letter from DMFI calling for action, and signed by more than  national and international celebrities including Simon Cowell, Sophia Latjuba, Yeslin Wang, Nadia Mulya, Lawrence Enzela, Cameron Diaz, Cha Islan, Ellen DeGeneres and Pierce Brosnan. Across Asia, opposition to the dog and cat meat trades is increasing, with an ever-growing number of countries and territoriesbanning the trade in and slaughter, sale and consumption of dogs. In South Korea, a task force has been set up by the government to discuss a dog meat ban following a suggestion by President Moon Jae-in.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Stock marketAnimalsSars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Gretta Vedler, , was killed a month after she posted on social media calling Putin a “psychopath” and forecasting his drive to “enhance the integrity of Russiawould end in tears.Her “jealous” ex-boyfriend Dmitry Korovin, , has confessed more than a year later to strangling her to death after a row over money in Moscow unrelated to her political views and analysis of Putin’s mind and motives. He told interrogators that he slept in a hotel room for three nights with her corpse which he put in a newly-bought suitcase. Follow all the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blogThen he drove her body  miles to Lipetsk region and left it in the boot of a car for more than a year. He kept posting pictures and messages on the model’s social media, to make friends believe she was still alive, he told detectives.A male friend called Evgeniy Foster - a blogger in Kharkiv, the Ukrainian city blitzed by Russian forces - became suspicious found a friend in Moscow to file a missing person case, triggering a search which eventually located her body. A video from Russia’s Investigative Committee shows Korovin allegedly demonstrating how he killed the model, and making a full confession. Her prescient postings on Putin in January , a month before she was murdered, are not seen as connected to her death but are chilling in the light of subsequent events. She was concerned over his crackdown on protests and what she saw as a desire to forge a bigger Russia.

Russia has failed to make the big inroads it is thought they were expecting and are making slow progress in trying to topple the Ukraine regime in Kyiv. They are slowly encircling the Ukraine capital but it is thought now that the inability to make decisive blows means that they will run out of manpower and energy sooner rather than later.Now, a senior UK defence source is reported to have said that Ukraine has Russia on the run and the attacker was running out of both manpower and energy. The source told the Daily Mail: As long as we keep pressing theyaposve got  to  days before reaching their culminating point. Thataposs when the strength of Ukraineaposs resistance should become greater than Russiaaposs attacking force.A similar view to the Mail source, where Russia will be forced to call a halt to their invasion by May, was held by Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidentaposs chief of staff, speaking late on Monday. In a video published by Ukrainian media, Arestovich said the exact timing of a withdrawal would depend on how much resources the Kremlin was willing to commit to the campaign. I think that no later than in May, early May, we should have a peace agreement, maybe much earlier, we will see, I am talking about the latest possible dates, Arestovich said.  We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April. A completely crazy scenario could also involve Russia sending fresh conscripts after a month of training, he said.Still, even once peace is agreed, small tactical clashes could remain possible for a year, according to Arestovich, although Ukraine insists on the complete removal of Russian troops from its territory. The war in Ukraine began on February  when Vladimir Putin launched what he called a special military operation, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a nightly address where he talked of the Russian forces suffering devastating losses and he tried to get their soldiers to surrender. Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive, he said. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose! Our brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops. Soon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost  warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment. In  days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya.

At the weekend, in his ongoing decimation of Ukraine, he hit a military facility close to the Polish border, bringing the war to NATO’s doorstep.  The Zircon - or Tsirkon - is being rushed into service this year after what Putin has described as successful tests. Russian experts say the missile has “no analogues” in the West. TV Zvezda - a channel owned by the Russian defence ministry - said of the footage: “The Russian Zircon hypersonic missileaposs stealth features have been disclosed… “The speed of the Zircon hypersonic missile is so high that it prevents the opponentaposs air defence system from detecting its impact in time. “In fact, its launch will be known only after the target has been hit.” The missile also has “iable trajectory” to avoid detection, viewers were told. “No one will see the missile launch or its flight. They will only see when the missile hits the target,” said the frigate’s commander, first rank captain Igor Krokhmal.  “A surface target, a coastal target. I donapost think there will be anything to counter this in the next few years.” Putin said in December: “Zircon are our newest missiles fired from the sea at sea targets, and land targets. “The tests were carried out successfully, flawlessly.“This is a big event for our country, a signicant step in improving Russia ’s security, in increasingdefence capability.”It is now in “serial production”, and he has previously called the weapon “truly unparalleled…in the world”.  While the footage is only released now, it is believed to date from December, and possibly had been deliberately held back for later to send chills through the West. At the time, Putin had boasted a salvo launch, but no footage was released. The latest launch coincided with a Kalibr missile launch from the same warship. The Zircon has been hailed by Moscow’s state-controlled TV as Putin’s weapon of choice to wipe out American cities in the event of an atomic conflict. However, its range has been put around  miles, although Krohmal has said it can strike at targets at a distance of  miles. It will initially be deployed from Russian frigates and later from submarines.  Kremlin deputy premier Yury Borisov has said that Russia had outpaced the West in hypersonic weapons - and intends to maintain its lead. He said: “We have broken forward, specically, in the sphere of hypersonic weapons andbased on new physical principles. “We now have serious advantages in this regard over the leading Western countries - and will try to maintain this position.” In Putin’s statement at the start of the war, he said: “A few words to those who might be tempted to interfere in the unfolding events from the outside. Anyone who tries to hinder us and... creates a threat for our country and our people must know that the response will be immediate and will lead to consequences that you have never faced in your history. We are ready for any scenario. All necessary decisions in this regard have been taken.

Marina is going to be charged with “publicly spreading knowingly  information about the Russian armed forces” and could face a sentence of up to  years in prison, the FTaposs Moscow Bureau chief Max Seddon tweeted this morning.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here However, her location remains unclear. Last night, Marinaaposs placard read stop the war, donapost believe propaganda, theyaposre lying to you. Producers quickly scrambled to cut her off and flip to B-roll for the viewers at home. Her message was written in Russian and English aimed at the channelaposs millions of viewers - but producers quickly switched the broadcast to a clip of a hospital as they dealt with the situation. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog Before she stormed the news segment it appeared she recorded a video beforehand where she apologised for her work on Russian state TV and blamed Vladimir Putin for the war. In the video, she said: Whataposs happening in Ukraine is a crime, and Russia is the aggressor. The responsibility for this aggression lies with one man: Vladimir Putin.My father is Ukrainian, my mother is Russian, and they were never enemies. This necklace [shows] Russia must stop this fratricidal war.  Unfortunately, for the last few years, Iaposve been working for Channel One. Iaposve been doing Kremlin propaganda and Iaposm very ashamed of it – that I let people lie from TV screens and allowed the Russian people to be zombied. We didnapost say anything in  when it only just began. We didnapost protest when the Kremlin poisoned Navalny. We just silently watched this inhuman regime. Now the whole world has turned away from us, and ten generations of our descendants wonapost wash off this fratricidal war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Marina for her brave actions.In a video shared on Telegra, Zelensky said: I am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones. He then addressed Marina directly and added: To those who are not afraid to protest. As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight. You must not lose your chance.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple.

It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

Harbour for more than  years, catching a iety of shellfish such as lobster, brown crab and whelk.The fishing industry was one of the hardest hit by the compounded effects of Brexit and lockdown but the family-run business has managed to turn a potential hurdle into a success.Lawrie said: “When lockdown just kicked in, that was the end of the foreign markets.“We had been thinking about changing how we operate but that forced us.“We had it in our mind to start selling privately because of Brexit as well and it all just came together, and we’ve not really looked back.”Lawrie and Eddie have now shted their business to much more of a local focus, selling their catch to restaurants and the public in the local area while also offering a delivery service.Lawrie said: “Everything was shipped into Europe beforehand but now we are selling direct to restaurants mainly in Edinburgh and a few places in East Lothian.“Everything we catch gets sold within  miles so instead of shipping into France, Spain and wherever , it’s nice for us to see what the stuff that we catch is being used for.”In Scotland it is not illegal to catch egg-bearing lobsters, but Lawrie believes this is harmful for the long-term viability of the industry and promotes a far more sustainable model.“We see that as madness that we are taking away that stock for the future, so we’ve completely eliminated that and we don’t keep any egg bearing females at all, they go straight back in the sea, straight away,” he said.“The creels that we use are recycled plastics so in that respect we are more sustainable with the materials that we use.”Lawrie also added that they were looking into using electric vans to help reduce their carbon footprint, which has already been greatly reduced by their new local model.“Because we are selling locally, that’s food miles that’s being cut down as well,” he added.The new model has also allowed everyone at Belhaven Lobster to become more involved locally and reconnect with the community at a personal level.Lawrie said: “During the first lockdown, people were looking for things to get out of the house for, a reason to go and try something a bit dferent.“So when we were selling direct to the public, you got to speak to people, connect with people and get their story and what they were planning to do with the shellfish that we catch.“They were getting our side of the story as well, and they were interested to find out how we catch them and where we catch them.“It was good for the customers, good for us and I think it has benefited the harbour in general as well.”Archerfield House by Dirleton is one of the venues that Belhaven Lobster supplies, with executive chefs David Jamieson and Joe Queen dedicated to using locally sourced goods.Joe said: “It’s just a great company to deal with.“In all sorts of weather, we are guaranteed to get the product we are after and to deal with they are just great guys that want to look after the customers.“We wanted them involved because they are so good, they are friendly but it’s the consistency of the product.“We need it kept local we need it kept home.“There’s always a need, especially for shellfish, in any decent restaurant.“We have a great relationship now, and long may it continue.”While the Belhaven Lobster team are not sure where the future may take them, they are eager to keep growing and expanding.Lawrie said: “Hopefully we are going to keep going with what we are doing andwe can pick up more and more restaurants and customers then that’s great.“We can hopefully try and expand a little bit more and

But you must know that they will eventually reappear.”“And the second solution ” asked the gardener.“Understand the lesson they teach us and celebrate their beauty and defiance.”The gardener was annoyed.“You are making fun of me,” he retorted angrily. “How can a dandelion teach us a lesson  It’s just a weed.”The old woman sipped her tea and smiled.“Have you ever been in a situation where you despair, where you have lost hope ”“Of course, many times,” replied the gardener, lowering his head.“Dandelions do not give up hope. They know that despite the efforts to destroy them, they will find a way to reappear. I discovered their lesson many years ago when I too tended a garden.”“But they are weeds!”“To you, yes. And they were also once for me, until I understood that they don’t just grow from the soil, but also from defiant hope.”The gardener thought for a moment: “We are not just talking about gardening are we ”The old woman sipped more tea, then spoke.“When I look around the world, full of despair, hatred, war and oppression, I hold onto the defiant hope of a dandelion.“I believe good can survive attempts to wipe it out, that peace can grow back, that love and understanding can triumph over evil and hate even in the darkest moments of loss, as long as we hold onto that hope and live by it.“That’s what this little flower has taught me, and why I no longer call it a weed.”The gardener nibbled his lip.“But what do I tell the king the next time he complains a dandelion is on his lawn ”The old woman finished her tea.“You tell him what I’ve just told you.

It’s Macaronesia, an epic land of swaying palms, shimmering beaches and vaulting volcanoes an oasis alive with superb seafood and wine. An exotic archipelago indeed, but one that has become banal in popular parlance often deadened in our collective imagination beyond Brits abroad cliches. But delve beneath the volcanic layers and the Canaries offer a le-affirming escape, especially when long haul is still too long for many of us.It always mysties me how many people are so dismissive, snobbish even, about the Canaries. Sure parched, previously little-used parts of this startling string of eight islands proved the ideal resort for defrosting northern Europeans with the advent of mass jet travel in the s. But it seems churlish to deride the Canaries for its flop and drop tourism when our demand created the resort strips in Tenere and Gran Canaria. In truth these mega resortslike giant aircraft carriers floating off the isles’ littorals, leaving the rest of the Canaries largely untrammelled by the tourist hordes.In the last three months I’ve been back to a trio of the Canaries and they’ve proved more soul-stirring than ever. I thought I appreciated my first sight of Teide from the plane, the big skies, waking the first morning to the thunderous surf of the Atlantic, and the first whf of garlic from a seafood grill hitting me just after the bone-dry minerality of a world-class white wine. Having been starved of their charms by a half dozen Covid cancellations, I now appreciate the Canaries on a whole new, renewed level. Venture back or discover them for the first time away from the obvious resorts and I swear you’ll feel the same.I kicked off just before Christmas when I swapped barely above freezing Scotland for the C heat of Gran Canaria, the second most populous of the eight Canary Isles. Hailed as the ‘Continent in Miniature’ it really packs a scenic punch, from the sweeping palm-fringed sand dunes of Maspalomas in the south, up through the pine forests into rugged mountains that soar higher than any in Scotland.I split my trip, starting in the capital Las Palmas, the only real city in the Canaries, indeed Spain’s ninth largest. Its bustling port was built by a Scot and Scottish legacies abound, not least at the Hotel Santa Catalina , where I was served creative tapas on the terrace by waiters swathed in tartan aprons with tartan-trimmed waistcoats. It’s a classy hotel too classy for me on this tripI stayed across the road at the modern Occidental Las Palmas , which proved a great base halfway between the old Vegueta quarter and the Rio-esque suburb of Las Canteras, with its sweeping beach. You’ll also find Tapas y Pinchos here at the Mercado del Puerto – grilled El Hierro cheese with sweet jam, followed my melt in the mouth croquetas and sizzling garlic prawns was as quintessentially Canarian as it was delicious.Pushing south I struck for those mountains, hiking up to the unmistakable rock outcrop of Roque Nublo. Gran Canaria is awash with hiking trails and I snaked off on another before lunch with a view at the Parador in Tejeda. There was time to take in the hanging balconies of Teror and the artist hideaway of Fataga, a whitewashed village tucked beneath improbable hills dotted with caves once inhabited by the indigenous Gaunche people. Would you be surprised to learn there are still troglodytes in the Canaries today  This is an archipelago that constantly surprises.Gran Canaria’s hinterland is breath-taking and the ideal foil to the pleasures of the coast, but it was the ocean that drew me next, and the welcoming arms of the Seaside Palm Beach , where I dined with Lisa Tuckman, a British ex-pat who has chosen to make Gran Canaria home. “It’s a brilliant island with it all, from beaches and the ocean, to tiny villages where time stands still and our special mountains. And the food is great too,” she smiled as we tucked into local fish cerne at dinner. I woke the next day for a sunrise bash across the sweeping Sahara-esque protected dunes of Maspalomas. Lisa was right - Gran Canaria is a brilliant island.Moving further east, getting closer to the African coast now, I flew out to Fuerteventura, the second largest Canary Island, in early February intent on staying put in one place. The island is often dismissed as one giant beach, ashaving world-class beaches and an eternal spring climate is something to be ashamed of. But it’s more than a beach, of course. I savoured boat-fresh seafood, the old fishing village vibe of the old quarter and the tapas bars of Corralejo, my favourite resort in the Canaries. That mainland Spaniards choose to holiday here says a lot that Italians do too seals the deal on the food front.I tried out a brace of hotels. I booked the Labranda Aloe Club Resort through Olympic Holidays , who can package together whole holidays on all three of these islandsyou don’t want to hunt around for flights, hotels and transfers. It was a cheap and cheerful three star elevated by staff who bounced around in the sun admirably trying to rope me into activities. They didn’t stint with the all-inclusive drinks either. With a brace of heated pools for the slightly cooler months it’s the sort of place I’d lovemy kids were with me.Travelling solo I preferred the Barcelo Bay . It was impossible not to relax at this adults-only oasis. If the palm-fringed pools and landscaped grounds were not enough, I had a hot tub on my terrace and a view of the volcanoes. The restaurant too upped the buffet ante with fresh cooking staycations and bone-dry Lanzarote white wine.Just across the water – reachable on a ferry ride away just shorter than Wemyss Bay to Rothesay – lies Lanzarote, the most easterly Canary Island, just over km from Africa still over ,km distant from Madrid. Michael Palin and his deeply unfair ‘Lanzagrotty’ jibebelie its reputation as the classiest Canary Isle. I am back here now on the island that only has one skyscraper due to one mercurial man. Artist and visionary Cesar Manrique worked tirelessly to control development and create his own ‘Nature-Art’ style.My brace of hotels this time continue this classy vibe. Seaside los Jameosin the biggest resort of Puerto del Carmen is a joy. Bedrooms are large, it’s right by the sands and staff are ultra-friendly. Setting the tone nicely is a hotel buffet that offers fresh local fish like cerne and vieja grilled to order, plus Lanzarote vegetables, herbs and delicious goat’s cheese. Then there is the wine– glorious bone-dry Malvasia backed up by a glorious red from the nearby vineyard Bermejo.Moving south to Playa Blanca, the Princesa Yaizalays a fair claim to being the island’s most luxurious hotel. It reclines right on the water in a wash of sumptuous bedrooms, pools that look as good as the brochure and views to Fuerteventura. You can enjoy a great buffet here or go Japanese, Italian or properly gastronomic at Los Lobos, a restaurant that showcases Lanzarote’s growing reputation for gastronomy.As it’s not a huge island I’ve not hired a car, sticking instead to day trips with a trio of brilliant operators. Lanzarote Wine Tours eschew tour buses with a maximum of eight passengers. I love that they include some of the big names like El Gro – Lanzarote’s oldest vineyard – along with family artisan newcomers like El Tablero. Blackstone Treks  Tours take a similar number of guests out hiking on this startlingly dramatic volcanic island. While tour operators haul groups around Timafaya National Park, Blackstone get you right in amongst it all in the volcanoes, with insights into the local flora and fauna.I end my Canarian adventures with Catlanza, a catamaran yacht operator run by creative Irishwoman Roisin McSorley, who offer sailings from Fuerteventura as well as Lanzarote. She meets me at Puerto Calero and explains they used to take  passengers out, now a maximum , as “people don’t mind paying a little more for a quality experience with much more space”.

However, the original tribunal accepted that it was taken in August  as digital evidence showed that date.The former fisheries worker maintained her position on the date in her recent application.Judge Kemp stated: “She maintains her position that the event in relation to her being taped to a chair occurred on  December , but what is stated in relation to that does not address the weight of evidence to the contrary as set out in the judgment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-makes-perfect-sense-bring-principal-teachers-back-secondary-schools","story":"We now have faculty heads with responsibility for a group of subject departments – for the members of these departments, the quality of their teaching, the strength of the dferent curricula, staff development needs, discipline, pupil welfare, parental links, assessment, the required resources, the internal and external exam requirements and SQA arrangements. The faculty heads meanwhile may only be qualied to teach one of the subjects for which they are responsible. This has meant a loss of crucial subject expertise and experience.In addition, the principal teachers, as key middle managers, played an absolutely vital part in the effective running of the school. I know from experience the value of the advice and guidance of the school’s principal teachers. I feel strongly that the loss of these posts cannot be helping the academic performance of Scotland’s secondary schools.Furthermore, as suggested in your article, the marked reduction in promoted posts in secondary schools seriously restricts career development for teachers and must be a disincentive for recruitment. When I started teaching there was a clear career structure for teachers as they moved from being a class teacher to a principal teacher, with assistant principal teacher posts created for the larger subject departments. For those teachers who wished to move into school leadership, the progression was from principal teacher to assistant head teacher, then to deputy head teacher before becoming a head teacher. This was a long apprenticeship which was a thorough preparation for the demanding job of head teacher. Compare this to the present structure where a teacher moves to the position of faculty head and then a deputy before being promoted to head teacher. This represents a signicant loss of opportunities for promotion as well as key stages in the preparation for headship.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.GREEN INVESTMENT IS NOT A RACKETBRIAN Wilsonattempts to make the case against current land ownership in Scotland suggesting that the term \"laird\" should be confined to soap operas set in big houses awash with tartan. On that point we are in complete agreement. Laird is a hopelessly anachronistic term and does not reflect that the vast majority of landowners are today running rural businesses which strive to make a positive social, economic and environmental contribution to Scotland. Where we unfortunately part company is over the suggestion that investment in natural capital, or green investment, is some kind of \"racket\". To portray green investment as a \"racket\" being perpetrated by so-called ‘green lairds’fails to reflect reality on the ground.Private owners, whether they are families who have been around for generations or are an investment company new to landownership, are helping government to tackle climate change by increasing forestry cover, providing clean energy and restore peatlands to lock up carbon, as well as continuing to supply affordable rural housing, local jobs and produce world-class food and drink and tourism experiences.We should not fall into the trap of pitting one land use against another. Tackling climate change is of paramount importance and can be addressed in combination with other land uses.Mr Wilson is right, though, to point to the soaring price of land, which is an issue not just in Scotland.The foremost reason for land price inflation is the Chancellor’s response to the global financial crisis and the pandemic, which was to pump money into an economy which was in recession. This produced a spike in asset prices across the world, not just in land but pretty much across all asset classes.If we are to reach net zero, Scotland will necessarily see some new types of landowners, hopefully communities but also financial institutions. I hope that these institutions will all become members of Scottish Land  Estates and follow the standards of best practice in responsible landowning which our members practice across Scotland.Mark Tennant, Chairman, Scottish Land  Estates, Musselburgh.Could Queen Mary sink Waverley YOU report the possibleof TS Queen Mary to sailing again on the Clyde .One wondersthe potential market is sufficiently strong to successfully sustain two large pleasure craft at this location.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What we are doing is try to improve, understand better what we want, being much more consistent in performance and results, but nothing  as yet.“Credit to Jurgen, the coaching staff and to the club as well for what they have created. They haven’t just created a team that can compete and be successful.“They have created a huge cultural understanding of who Liverpool is today. The stadium and the atmosphere they can create, the support, the level, how they communicate.“It’s a long of things, not just iniduals, or the players that they have recruited and the plan that they had to reach that level. It’s a whole plan that I really value, I think.”A - win over Leicester on Sunday leaves Arsenal in a great position as they look to end a five-year absence from the Champions League.With the youngest average age of any squad in the top flight, the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard have shone in attack for Arsenal of late.Add to that goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale as well as players such as Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes – the latter of whom is the oldest name mentioned at the age of  – and it is clear Arteta is putting his faith in youth.That belief extends to the fact Arsenal will now be entering games as many people’s favourites to finish in the top four.“That’s the pressure of playing for this club,” he said.“It’s to be the best and we are not that yet. Sothe objective is that, it’s not a pressure it has to be a motivation, a challenge, and a clear understanding that the purpose to play for this club is only to be the best.😎😎😎📲 IG ben_white pic ykqwUqANIp— ArsenalMarch , “What we have done so far means absolutely nothing and I think everybody has to be encouraged and empowered by the possibility always to find ways to improve and get better.“Winning another game in this league always gives you momentum. Being able to beat the most in-form team in the country would be really, really big so that’s the aim tomorrow.”While Saka and Ramsdale are all-but assured of a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad, named on Thursday, Arteta is hopeful White will be rewarded for his fine club form this season.“We are really happy with his performances, how he has adapted, what he brings to the team certainly,” he added.“Hopefully he can get rewarded, because the way that he trains, he looks at himself and the performances that he’s having. He is certainly creating that attention, from a lot of people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"baby-among-latest-group-people-cross-channel-small-boats  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

She is still at her family home in Tehran. I also understand that there is a British negotiating team in Tehran right now.

So we remain cautious and continue to encourage the UK Government to do the right thing and ensure the debt it owes to Iran is paid, and that it does everything in its power to secure Nazanin’s release.”In relation to the debt, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We continue to explore options to resolve this case and will not comment further as discussions are ongoing.”On the cases of Britons detained, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We have long called for the release of unfairly detained British nationals in Iran.

In addition, almost % of our woodland is in the form of recent coner plantations.The Woodland Trust said Northern Ireland needs to signicantly increase tree plantingit is to help towards a UK woodland target.The conservation charity previously published its Emergency Tree Plan. The plan sets out how the UK can rapidly increase tree cover to help reach net zero carbon emissions and tackle the declines in wildle.Northern Ireland would need to plant , hectares of trees a year to hit an existing target of % cover by . To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May. This financial year the DfI Minister allocated a combined budget £m to NI Water for  .Coal banSmoky coal is one of the worst causes of air pollution. It has been reported that approximately , premature deaths have been averted in Dublin since the introduction of a coal ban back in . In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most Read Derry pupils end up locked in luggage compartment during school bus morning run… Translink has issued apologyLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontNorthern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service chief resigns just six months after taking the roleCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicTop VideosPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayBAFTA: Kenneth Branagh celebrates Belfast, which has won Outstanding British FilmPlaySteph Basnett on her stalking nightmare by ex Riagain GraingerLatest EnvironmentStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedAsk the experts: Pollution charges to cut congestionEco friendly: the rise and rise of sustainable citiesLatestWoman in Russian state TV protest showed ‘huge bravery’, says UK ministerInterest-free periods on credit cards are getting longer, analysis findsSkies turn orange as dust from Sahara dumped on SpainRobert Rinder warns history is ‘repeating itself’ as refugees flee UkraineChristian Eriksen back in Denmark squad nine months after cardiac arrest,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueQUB said it “continually reviews its suppliers and how their service fits with value for money, as well as supporting local business and a sustainable future for all”.Thomas CopelandMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailQueen’s University Belfastspent more than £, on nearly , Amazon purchases during the pandemic.Nearly one in three transactions made using QUB staff purchasing cards between August  and July  were credited to the online retail giant, Freedom of Information requests have revealed.This has been met with criticism from some QUB staff and students who say that Amazon has a damaging impact on the environment and on local businesses.The university said it “continually reviews its suppliers and how their service fits with value for money, as well as supporting local business and a sustainable future for all”.According to its Strategy , QUB is committed to “reaching net-zero carbon emissions as soon as possible”.Professor John Barry, director of the Centre for Sustainability, Equality and Climate Action at QUB said: “It’s hypocritical. The university, like a lot of corporate institutions, puts out these statements with rhetorical commitments to sustainable development. Like the Irish football team, it’s great on paper but crap on grass.“These are goods that have been made God knows where in the world, warehoused in Belgium or London and then sent over here. All of that has a carbon cost.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Amazon’s latest carbon footprint report detailed that the company’s emissions increased by % in  to more than  million metric tons, equal to the annual emissions of Austria.QUB would not disclose information on the products bought and on Amazon purchases made by staff that were subsequently refunded by the university.It did say that the purchasing cards are “a payment system used by the university to support low-value and high-volume purchases.Not all staff are issued with a purchasing card.However, according to Professor Barry, “that just opens up more questions than answers”.At Ulster University, less than one in  transactions using staff purchasing cards were credited to Amazon in the same period, totalling around £,.“Small businesses like mine have struggled during the pandemic”, said Jenny Steele, a QUB student and business owner.“Yet we have been ignored by Queen’s in favour of cheap products and cheap labour. Despite making promises to support local businesses, Queen’s has turned to unethical and unsustainable suppliers like Amazon.”Professor Barry added: “Queen’s made £m over the pandemic from international student fees. “I do not accept that the university could not afford to pay more for goods from local businesses.”QUB said it has “contracted suppliers for a wide range of goods and services and these suppliers should be approached in the first instance. In the event that a contracted supplier is not in a position to fulfil a requirement, alternative suppliers are permitted”.Some students have moved to defend QUB.  First-year student Sam Haslett said: “During the pandemic, everyone used Amazon far more.“If Queen’s is guilty of damaging the environment or local businesses, then we all are. Plus loads of small businesses now sell through Amazon anyway.”The online retailer reported that around , small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Ireland exported more than £m in goods through Amazon in .A  report estimated that QUB contributes £.bn to the UK economy every year.Most Read Derry pupils end up locked in luggage compartment during school bus morning run… Translink has issued apologyLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicNorthern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service chief resigns just six months after taking the roleTop VideosPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayBAFTA: Kenneth Branagh celebrates Belfast, which has won Outstanding British FilmPlaySteph Basnett on her stalking nightmare by ex Riagain GraingerLatest Northern IrelandUkraine refugee scheme: At least , homes in NI lie emptyPerformance and attitude are now key for Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter ahead of Ballymena United clashFive arrested in Lyra McKee murder probeLyra McKee: Five men arrested in connection with murder of journalist in DerryWatch: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in DerryLatestSchools minister says ‘we do need to talk about world as it is’ on trans rightsBaby is among latest group of people to cross Channel in small boatsTeenager admits music video murder in BrixtonStar Hobson’s mother has sentence for allowing toddler’s death increasedMikel Arteta backs Arsenal to cope with pressure of being top-four favourites,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I landed with my daughter and the gates were closed. A car was parked across the entrance and the children weren’t allowed in.“We weren’t given any notice of this as parents. Rua is asking me questions about why she was wasn’t allowed in but it’s hard to explain to a three-year-old.“Parents were staggered by the fact it was closed.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up She added: “People who are working would have had to take the day off to look after their children.“I hope whatever has happened is going to be resolved. My wee boy who is eight now also attended Treehouse. It’s a great crèche and there are never any problems with it.”Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council and UNISON community and voluntary branch, Niall McCarroll was in attendance in support of workers and affected families at the centre in Creggan.He told the Belfast : “Parents who turned up with the children this morning, and workers, arrived to find the gates were locked.“Our members contacted us to say they were met with a placard which said the crèche was closed.“Two people were trying to give out letters to parents.“As far as we are concerned this has left workers unable to do their jobs and we will be providing whatever support we can.”After a standoff, children were eventually granted entry to the crèche.Last year a letter was sent to iniduals responsible for running Treehouse Crèche.It advised staff members thatthey did not cooperate with RRC management then they would have “no alternative but to close the facility in the interests of child protection and safeguarding”.In the correspondence, which was shared on social media, RRC management said they had asked to meet Treehouse employees to discuss staff ratios, staff training, inidual education plans, and safeguarding and child protection.The letter added: “I do not understand the action being taken by you as staff since your only standing is as employees of the Rosemount Resource Centre.”That development came after a split was revealed between the management committee and staff at RRC.Ten members of staff from RRC signed a letter of ‘no confidence’ in the management committee.A list of grievances and concerns were laid out over two-and-a-half pages.The letter was sent to the local council and circulated amongst councillors.In response, a solicitor acting on behalf of the management committee asked the council to “address this issue”.Workers who signed the letter say they have provided a collective  years’ service to the local community.It’s understood that the créche formed its own independent board, however, RRC still own the building.The Department for Communities and Rosemount Resource Centre have been contacted for comment.Most Read Derry pupils end up locked in luggage compartment during school bus morning run… Translink has issued apologyLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicNorthern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service chief resigns just six months after taking the roleTop VideosPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayBAFTA: Kenneth Branagh celebrates Belfast, which has won Outstanding British FilmPlaySteph Basnett on her stalking nightmare by ex Riagain GraingerLatest Northern IrelandUkraine refugee scheme: At least , homes in NI lie emptyPerformance and attitude are now key for Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter ahead of Ballymena United clashFive arrested in Lyra McKee murder probeLyra McKee: Five men arrested in connection with murder of journalist in DerryWatch: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in DerryLatestSchools minister says ‘we do need to talk about world as it is’ on trans rightsBaby is among latest group of people to cross Channel in small boatsTeenager admits music video murder in BrixtonStar Hobson’s mother has sentence for allowing toddler’s death increasedMikel Arteta backs Arsenal to cope with pressure of being top-four favourites,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneyStaff ReporterMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailUnionists have welcomed a climbdown by the Government over customs regulations that proposed changing all mentions of “the United Kingdom” to “Great Britain” — deliberately omitting Northern Ireland.Sky News reported that Foreign Secretary and UK Brexit negotiator Liz Truss had ordered officials to investigate how the statutory instrumentwas allowed to get to that point without “proper political scrutiny”.In multiple amendments to the The Customs Regulations , it was proposed that instead of using the words “the United Kingdom” that “Great Britain” should be used instead.The Government had presented the amendments as minor and insignicant and would ensure NI-GB trade could “continue smoothly”.The move provoked uproar online, as critics noted that this would directly contradict the Government’s position on the Northern Ireland Protocol by entrenching it further.Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said he thought the initial move was “reprehensible by this Tory Government”.“Why on earth would we trust them, where is the sense in handing power to them ” he asked.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We must stand our ground and represent the people of Northern Ireland within the Union — not give up for political expediency.”Conservative MP Steve Baker said Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement “makes clear that Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the UK.

Credit: Liam McBurneySam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe new head of the Civil Service has declined to say whether it is acceptable for a Stormont department to attempt to overturn a judicial finding that a civil servant was driven from her job after she blew the whistle on potential fraud and animal suffering.Last week the Belfastrevealed the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswas using taxpayers’ money to attempt to overturn a devastating judgment that raised serious concerns about Northern Ireland’s chief vet and one of his deputies.Six months ago an employment tribunal unanimously found that Tamara Bronckaers, a senior DAERA vet with an “exemplary performance and record”, had been constructively sacked because she blew the whistle.The case has major implications for the treatment of Civil Service whistleblowers, the welfare of animals, the spread of disease, and the reputation of the cattle traceability system which, since the BSE crisis, has been central to how the agriculture industry has marketed local beef.The public could be forced to pay £m to compensate her, along with huge legal bills.In a ,-word judgment, Employment Judge Ó Murray repeatedly criticised the whistleblower’s treatment by two of her senior colleagues — line manager Julian Henderson and chief vet Robert Huey.At the heart of the case was Dr Bronckaers’ desire to pursue enforcement action against Ballymena Livestock Market over alleged suffering caused to animals, and animal movements being electronically deleted.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Dr Huey told her he knew the manager of the market personally and also its chairman. Both he and Dr Henderson discouraged her from pursuing enforcement, with Dr Bronckaers left in tears after an encounter with Dr Huey. Both men remain in post, while Dr Bronckaers does not. The Belfastasked Dr Bradyas head of the Civil Service she had anything to say about whether, on her watch, this will be acceptable, and whether she has any message to other whistleblowers.In response the Executive Office, within which the head of the Civil Service sits, responded: “It is not appropriate to comment on an ongoing legal issue which is a matter for DAERA.”Dr Brady, who was brought in from Belfast City Council, was appointed last year.Three months ago she told an Assembly committee that one of her key priorities was to deliver the recommendations of the RHI Inquiry, and said “of course we’re all aware of the whistleblowing legislation”.There was no suggestion that Dr Bronckaers was anything other than genuine, and the Civil Service handbook makes clear that whistleblowers should be encouraged.It states that the organisation “encourages staff to raise issues of concern internally to provide an opportunity to have such matters investigated and addressed as appropriate. Reasonable belief that wrongdoing has taken place is sufficient justication… It will always be assumed that concerns have been raised in good faith unless there is evidence to the contrary”.It adds that officials “should not suffer any detriment or harassment as a result.”If DAERA loses its appeal, taxpayers will fund Dr Bronckaers’ compensation, which could be as much as £m, plus hefty legal bills.Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - The Executive OfficeMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyIntegrated Education Bill is shameful, claims DUP’s Edwin Poots PremiumMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ body PremiumUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeUUP’s Beattie urges NI households to take part in Ukrainian refugee scheme launched on Monday PremiumSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontMost Read Derry pupils end up locked in luggage compartment during school bus morning run… Translink has issued apologyLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicNorthern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service chief resigns just six months after taking the roleTop VideosPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlaySteph Basnett on her stalking nightmare by ex Riagain GraingerPlayBAFTA: Kenneth Branagh celebrates Belfast, which has won Outstanding British FilmLatest PoliticsUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeAllison MorrisOpinionNI Protocol must go on backburner while heating crisis is hereLatestNo fatal accident inquiry into death of new mother who ‘got lost in hospital’It might become my last day: Ukrainian describes Russian soldiers searching homeWoman in Russian state TV protest showed ‘huge bravery’, says UK ministerInterest-free periods on credit cards are getting longer, analysis findsSkies turn orange as dust from Sahara dumped on Spain,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector. We would be contributing to our pathway to net zero and have a vastly reduced reliance on fossil fuels — with their polluting emissions reduced by %.”He said that Stormont could solve the problem by reinstating the missing  words — essentially replicating the GB scheme, with cost controls, something he said “could solve the political problems that Stormont and the department have created for themselves and for the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Trimble highlighted that in , a Commons committee inquiry branded the department’s actions “a raw deal”, but the department had repeatedly failed to help genuine claimants suffering as a result of their broken promises.Related topicsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeArlene FosterSinn FéinClimate ChangeMore On Department for the Economy‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsDepartment​​ of Economy slammed over Covid spend PremiumEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfall PremiumEconomy is being distorted by Invest NI focusing on Belfast, claims MLAMost Read Derry pupils end up locked in luggage compartment during school bus morning run… Translink has issued apologyLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicNorthern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service chief resigns just six months after taking the roleTop VideosPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayBAFTA: Kenneth Branagh celebrates Belfast, which has won Outstanding British FilmPlaySteph Basnett on her stalking nightmare by ex Riagain GraingerLatest PoliticsMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyNew Civil Service chief silent over whistleblower caseBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeAllison MorrisOpinionNI Protocol must go on backburner while heating crisis is hereLatestTeenager admits music video murder in BrixtonStar Hobson’s mother has sentence for allowing toddler’s death increasedMikel Arteta backs Arsenal to cope with pressure of being top-four favouritesVirgin Atlantic reports strong bookings despite cost of living pressuresHM sales accelerate as pandemic rebound continues,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We#re not going to rule out people teaching about thatRobin Walker“I very much welcome the new political guidance that’s been put out to schools. I completely agree – we should let children be children we shouldn’t be pushing adult political agendas in schools,” she said.She added that in the guidance there were  worked examples of issues around impartiality that could occur in schools about racism, dferent political systems, environmentalism and other topical issues.But she added that what was “conspicuous by its absence” was any example relating to the teaching of gender ideology, “by which I mean schools teaching against guidance that there are more than two sexes, that you can change sex, thatyou are gender non-conforming it might mean that you are the opposite sex to what you are biologically”.She said that anecdotally, parents had written to her expressing concern that “schools are transitioning pupils without their parents’ knowledge” and that this included pupils who might be gay and lesbian, or on the autism spectrum.She askedthe guidance could be updated to reflect this, and whether the Department for Education would investigate these reports.Schools minister Robin Walker said: “The first thing I’d say is that schools should not be teaching ideology, regardless of in what space that is, and I think we’re pretty clear about that in the political impartiality guidance.“We want schools to be able to support pupils, including the small number of pupils who may have gender identity issues and may need support in that respect, and it’s important thatthey approach members of staff they can be signposted to the right advice and support,” he added.He said that issues around sex and gender had to be taught in an “age-appropriate way” and that there were some “really complex legal issues to do with the Equality Act in this space”.The Government was working with the Equality and Human Rights Commissionto explore this, he said.“I think it’s important that we balance responsibility to protected characteristics of sex with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, which is also protected under the Equality Act, and we make sure that we address the concerns that parents may have in this space,” he said.Responding to Ms Cates’ view that DfE guidance was clear “you can’t tell children you can change sex”, he said: “You said you’re not supposed to tell pupils that they can change sex – of course, you can do that, because you are supposed to teach LGBT content. You should not teach them that they should change sex.”He later claried that he had used “sex” and “gender” interchangeably but added: “We do need to talk about the world as it is.”“We need to talk about the fact that people do transition and that there are trans people, and we should support them as a protected group under the Equality Act. We’re not going to rule out people teaching about that,” he said.He added that the DfE should be “making sure it’s taught in an appropriate way and making sure it’s not encouraging something which would be medically dficult and could have implications for people’s mental health”.MP Tom Hunt said that it appeared that the guidance may not have “sufficient teeth” to make a dference, referring to the recent downgrading by Ofsted of the American School in London for its focus on “social justice” in its teaching.He asked whether Ofsted would make similar judgments when it came to state schools.Mr Walker said Ofsted was a separate entity but that the Government had published the guidance “for a reason” and that he believed most schools did not want to tell their pupils what to think or go into “politically contentious territory”.Labour MP Kim Johnson described the new guidance as “unnecessary” as schools had already been aware of their responsibility to be impartial.Elsewhere in the session, Mr Walker said that the low uptake of the National Tutoring Programme through the tuition partners route could be due to staff absence.“I recognise that particularly during the first half of this term, many schools were probably under too much pressure from staff absence in order to be able to engage with a programme like this to the extent we might like them to have done.”Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons’ Education Committee, said that the high levels of satisfaction with the programme reported by schools was akin to “truck production in the Soviet Union” given how unevenly spread tuition uptake was across the country.

The festival was last held in .Cllr Hanna said that while it was disappointing that this yearrsquos event would not be going ahead, a number of suggestions for an alternative festival had been made. He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The gates will be replaced with a perforated double metal gate.Planners say the removal of the ldquobulky rear extension to the existing listed building can only be seen as a betterment to its integrity and intrinsic character ldquo.In addition, they say the demolition proposal does not ldquooffend the essential character of the building with its setting retained and its features of special interest remaining intact and unimpaired.Planners have also stipulated that any proposed demolition work proposed within one metre of the Newcastle Centre shall be carried out by hand and that no power tools must be used to ensure no damage to the existing building.The proposed new leisure complex will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.Itrsquos also understood that the eagerly-awaited new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which enjoys protected status, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Late last year, it was revealed that an economist and team of expert consultants would be appointed to design the new leisure facility, with Newry, Mourne and Down Council adding an additional pound, to its capital programme to help deliver the new complex.The planned investment at the current Newcastle Centre housed in the Annesley Buildings is also a key plank of the local authorityrsquos capital investment programme.Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, said it was well known that Newcastle ldquoneeds and deserves a fit-for-purpose leisure centre.She said while the local authority has faced many hurdles over recent years in delivering a new leisure complex, all Mournes councillors understand there are no longer any available sites within the town which are of a suitable size to build what is needed.But Cllr Devlin said this could not be used as an excuse, highlighting the need to deliver for the people of town and visitors.ldquoThe council is proceeding with plans for a replacement centre on the current Newcastle Centre site, she continued. ldquoFrom the outset of this process I have said that this must include a pool and that remains my position.ldquoI appreciate there are swimming pools within the district butwe are serious about tourism we need to look at a rainy day offering in Newcastle and I believe that a pool would tick that box, as well as providing a superb facility for our local community.Cllr Devlin said she looks forward to forward to seeing the outline business case and the eagerly-awaited project progressing at long last.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion.Two sites were previously identied for the new centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Politically the situation is much more complicated in the eastern part of Ukraine. People in the eastern part of the country are very Russian. But % of the people in the Ukraine donrsquot care about politics and just what a happy, peaceful le.Mr Johnston described the now impractical steps his relatives which have to taken in order to get a visa.ldquoThey would normally have to travel  hours on an overnight train from Mariupol to Kyiv to get a visa granted for travel. In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaNews Busy Co Antrim road reopened after late night road traffic collision Gemma MurrayOpinion EU will be thrilledUK is giving up on suspending Northern Ireland Protocol Editorial signing the ‘confidence and supply’ deal which led to the DUP supporting both the Theresa May and Boris Johnson governments\" layout\"fill\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMjgOTYx.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fill i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"fill\"Opinion Lord Empey: For DUP to say Stormont is their only leverage is to admit defeat Reg EmpeyOpinion Owen Polley: Ukraine another excuse for government to do nothing about protocol Owen PolleyNews Survivors remember , ‘worst year of Troubles’, at special service By The NewsroomPolitics SDLP to put forward emergency legislation for cost of living relief By The Newsroom and Taoiseach Micheal Martin in the stands ahead of the Guinness Six Nations match at Twickenham Stadium, London.\" src\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzEwODkz.jpg crop:,smartwidth\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzEwODkz.jpg crop:,smartwidth w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzEwODkz.jpg crop:,smartwidth w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzEwODkz.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" layout\"fill\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fill i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"fill\" Brexit Johnson hopes united UK EU front on Ukraine can help to fix protocol By The NewsroomCrime ‘Accordion man’ Ken Hopkins targeted again by thieves By The NewsroomPolitics NI Green Party conference: Clare Bailey says Stormont crisis ‘very damaging and ...

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Gunners have won five games in a row and sit fourth in the table, a point clear of Manchester United having played three matches fewer than their old rivals.Title-chasing Liverpool are next up for Arsenal as Jurgen Klopp’s side look to close to within a point of leaders Manchester City with victory at the Emirates Stadium.Arsenal will pose a tough test for the   champions but Arteta concedes they are not yet at the level of the league’s elite outfits. vw,vw,px, px\"Arsenal are favourites for a top-four finish AskedArsenal are one of the best teams in the country at the moment, he replied: “No, there are better teams in the country because that’s what the league table shows.“We haven’t done anything. What we are doing is try to improve, understand better what we want, being much more consistent in performance and results, but nothing  as yet.“Credit to Jurgen, the coaching staff and to the club as well for what they have created. They haven’t just created a team that can compete and be successful.“They have created a huge cultural understanding of who Liverpool is today. The stadium and the atmosphere they can create, the support, the level, how they communicate.“It’s a long of things, not just iniduals, or the players that they have recruited and the plan that they had to reach that level. It’s a whole plan that I really value, I think.”A - win over Leicester on Sunday leaves Arsenal in a great position as they look to end a five-year absence from the Champions League.With the youngest average age of any squad in the top flight, the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard have shone in attack for Arsenal of late.Add to that goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale as well as players such as Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes – the latter of whom is the oldest name mentioned at the age of  – and it is clear Arteta is putting his faith in youth..removeThat belief extends to the fact Arsenal will now be entering games as many people’s favourites to finish in the top four.“That’s the pressure of playing for this club,” he said.“It’s to be the best and we are not that yet. Sothe objective is that, it’s not a pressure it has to be a motivation, a challenge, and a clear understanding that the purpose to play for this club is only to be the best.😎😎😎📲 IG ben_white pic ykqwUqANIp— ArsenalMarch , “What we have done so far means absolutely nothing and I think everybody has to be encouraged and empowered by the possibility always to find ways to improve and get better.“Winning another game in this league always gives you momentum. Being able to beat the most in-form team in the country would be really, really big so that’s the aim tomorrow.”While Saka and Ramsdale are all-but assured of a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad, named on Thursday, Arteta is hopeful White will be rewarded for his fine club form this season.“We are really happy with his performances, how he has adapted, what he brings to the team certainly,” he added.“Hopefully he can get rewarded, because the way that he trains, he looks at himself and the performances that he’s having. He is certainly creating that attention, from a lot of people.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Mikel Arteta backs Arsenal to cope with pressure of being top-four favourites article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She is still at her family home in Tehran. I also understand that there is a British negotiating team in Tehran right now.

So we remain cautious and continue to encourage the UK Government to do the right thing and ensure the debt it owes to Iran is paid, and that it does everything in its power to secure Nazanin’s release.”In relation to the debt, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We continue to explore options to resolve this case and will not comment further as discussions are ongoing.”On the cases of Britons detained, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We have long called for the release of unfairly detained British nationals in Iran.

Due to Covid, and the mitigations in place at the time, it was scaled back to avoid unnecessary social interaction and focussed on preaching in congregations and virtual meetings.Right Reverend Dr David Bruce and Zoe BruceAs Rev Dr Trevor McCormick, Clerk of the Presbytery of Coleraine  Limavady, explained, with the rhythm of church le ing to normal, he is looking forward to welcoming the Moderator to the Presbytery. “We are looking forward, with great anticipation, to welcoming Dr Bruce and his we Zoë, to the Presbytery next week. With  congregations stretching along the North Coast from Limavady to Portrush and into the rural hinterland from Banagher and Dungiven through the lower Bann Valley and across to Ballyrashane and Ballywatt, we are erse in our settings and size of congregations.”The minister of Kilrea and Boveedy continued: “Following the challenges of the past two years we believe that the Moderator’s visit will be an encouragement to many within our church families and in the wider community. Dr Bruce will conduct worship in Derramore and Drumchose congregations in Limavady this coming Sunday, and Ballysally, Coleraine the following Sunday.“He will also lead worship via livestream for the whole Presbytery and close his visit with an in-person rally, the first for two years. This will take place in one of the largest churches in the Presbytery, Aghadowey Presbyterian Church the same evening. Everyone is welcome,” Dr McCormick said.Right Reverend Dr David Bruce and Zoe BruceAside from preaching, during a packed week of engagements Dr Bruce will pay a courtesy call on the Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens and visit ious community projects which involve Ballysally, Terrace Row and Hazelbank Presbyterian Churches. He will take the assembly in the Irish Society Primary School, meet residents and staff at PCI’s care home, Trinity House in Garvagh, while encouraging prison and hospital chaplains at HMP Magilligan and Causeway Hospital. He will also meet senior staff.Meetings with farmers, Coleraine’s Street Pastors, PSNI, and Limavady Chamber of Trade are also on the agenda - along with to the Royal National Leboat Institution’s leboat in Portrush.Looking forward to the tour, Dr Bruce said, “Each Presbytery Tour is similar. They are very much pastoral visits with opportunities to encourage the local Church, especially our ministers, who have certainly been on the frontline over the last two years. They are also opportunities to acknowledge the work that they and their congregations are in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.“At the same time, they are also inidual and dferent, providing important opportunities for a Moderator to get ‘out and about’, getting to know the church in a particular area, seeing first-hand the work that congregations are doing in the community. As a church, we also seek to be active in meeting with a range of public representatives and sectoral groups to listen, discuss their concerns, hear and understand the issues that they face. These opportunities also take place on presbytery tours and are incredibly useful,” he said.During the week he will also meet the Presbytery’s active ministers in four ‘Refresh Groups’, part of the Moderator’s ‘Refresh’ initiative. “The initiative seeks to encourage and equip, inspire and invigorate those on the frontline of PCI’s ministry during the pandemic,” Dr Bruce explained.“It began April  when we encouraged ministers to join ‘Refresh Groups’, organised by each of our  presbyteries as part of their pastoral care responsibility for their ministers. Since then we have followed up with a number of in-person and virtual events involving our ministers, deaconesses, youth workers, community outreach workers, and others, and I am looking forward to meeting our minsters in each of the four groups for a chat, fellowship and a time of prayer together,” Dr Bruce said.This visit to the Presbytery of Coleraine  Limavady will be the first to be undertaken by a Moderator since . “From the Brexit referendum and Brexit itself, to the impact of the pandemic, much has changed in the last six years since of my predecessors, Dr Frank Sellar, toured the presbytery. It will be important for me to hear how our Presbyterian family has fared and indeed supported their local communities, particularly in the early days of the pandemic and the lockdowns.“I will be thanking our ministers, elders and volunteers for their supportive work during the pandemic and indeed those also on the frontline, like our chaplains and care home staff who I will be meeting. Coupled with all that happens on a presbytery tour, first and foremost I will be bringing a message of hope, the hope that is found in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,” Dr Bruce said.In conclusion, Dr McCormick said, “This is a key time in the le of our congregations and community, when we must seize the opportunities of revitalisation, reconnection and re-engagement. We know that Dr Bruce will play a signicant part in this through his visit and time of ministry with us.”Read More Read MoreSignicant progress at NRC’s new £m Coleraine campusLimavady  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most Popular due in court following serious assault in Cookstown pub\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--due-in-court-following-serious-assault-in-cookstown-pub- itm_sourceparsely-api\" due in court following serious assault in Cookstown pub\" \"\" width\"\" due in court following serious assault in Cookstown pub\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--due-in-court-following-serious-assault-in-cookstown-pub- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Mandue in court following serious assault in Cookstown...NewsYoung man injured and badly shaken as plague of anti-social ...NewsTwo rescued from water after Doagh collision...NewsOil price: Cheapest places in Northern Ireland for home heat...NewsVictim allegedly struck repeatedly with sock containing snoo...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
