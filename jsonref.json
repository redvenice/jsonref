This shot of the legendary Diego Maradona was taken by Mark Leech in 1987When Diego Armando Maradona joined Napoli in 1984, 70,000 people flocked to see him arrive at the San Paolo stadium, scarcely able to believe that one of the greatest footballers alive had chosen to join an unsuccessful side from an impoverished part of Italy. Maradona would eventually gift unprecedented riches to Napoli, leading them to a first Scuddeto in their history in 1987, among other achievements, and was dubbed the ‘God of Naples’. This beautiful picture distils the euphoria of that period and recognises Maradona as the leader of his adopted people. However, the good times didn’t last. Asif Kapadia’s riveting 2019 documentary, constructed from over 500 hours of never-before-seen footage, recounted how Maradona became conflicted by his involvement with the mafia. A 15-month punishment for using cocaine and the scandal of fathering a baby, whom he refused to acknowledge as his own, ultimately saw him exiled from Napoli in disgrace.

There is almost nothing to the film, Exodus. McQueen had been hanging around Brick Lane marketin London, looking for something to film. The men weave through the Sunday crowds, sometimes disappearing except for their pork pie hats and the potted plants. Shot in 1992, and just over a minute long, Exodus is a kind of talisman for McQueen’s earlier work. Although he didn’t use the footage for five years, Exodus is also an early indication of his ability to seize the moment, to find richness in a detail or a circumstance.Tate Modern’s exhibition of 14 works jumps to 1999, missing those that led to his winning the Turner prize that year, and ends with Weight, from 2016, a prisoner’s bed-frame draped with a gold-plated mosquito net, first shown in an Artangel exhibition in the cells of Reading Gaol. Much from the current century, including his feature films and the work McQueen has been making about Grenfell Tower, is also absent. This may disappoint viewers expecting a full mid-career survey, akin to the Art Institute of ChicagoSchaulager Basel show in 2013. Such a show would need triple the space and, however one might quibble, as an ensemble the current show has density, weight and drama in its very different kinds of confrontations.You are there with Tricky, smoking skunk in the sound booth, as he lays down the vocal track to the song Girls, thrashing around and getting into a kind of trance, pushing himself and twisting the lyrics. The graininess of Sean Bobbit’s Super 8 cinematography in Western Deep makes the 2002 film, as McQueen has said, “stick to the skin”. This intimacy and physical, as well as psychological, sense of proximity and engagement – even engulfment, let alone the astonishment and horror Western Deep provokes, however many times one has seen it – is amped up by those parts of the film when everything collapses into darkness and grain, blur and amorphousness.Illuminer depicts McQueen himself on a Paris hotel bed in the semi-dark, lit by the TV and its footage of American Seals and the war in Iraq. Made in 2001, it is almost the last time the artist appeared in one of his own films and is, like Exodus, another work in which the artist exploited circumstance and the specific conditions of time and place. McQueen is alert to the here and now. This is just as evident in his cinema film work as it is in his gallery films and installations.Throughout the exhibition, we are confronted again and again by black bodies, black subjects, black experience, whether it is the anonymous miners in Western Deep or Tricky the artist’s cousin Marcus, who accidentally shot his brother or Ashes, a young Grenadian who McQueen filmed in 2002, and who was later killed by drug dealers. Then there are the Grenadians who appear in Caribs’ Leap, McQueen himself, his black fingers poking and caressing the folds round Charlotte Rampling’s eye in Charlotte, and rubbing and tweaking his own nipple in Cold Breath.Storytelling, even when what we are presented with is a situation, is a viewpoint. In 7th Nov, the camera’s view of the top of Marcus’s head is as though we are looking at a body on a slab. The views of the cemetery and the workman building Ashes’ tombstone over his pauper’s grave is allied to physicality, position and scale in the artist’s projections. The small screens and lumbering, body-sized projectors for Charlotte and Cold Breath and the large screen on the outside wall of Tate Modern, facing across the river, on which footage of everyday life in Grenada (one half of Caribs’ Leap) is shown, keep us aware that looking at films is a physical as much as a psychological act.The camera circling the Statue of Liberty in a helicopter, showing the bird shit and the rot in the bronze, the sound of helicopter blades thwapping, and the descent 3.5 kilometres underground in Western Deep, one of the world’s deepest gold mines, are felt in the body as well as the head.In a big, otherwise empty room, the redacted FBI files on actor, singer and activist Paul Robeson are projected, unfolding in decades worth of paper and effort that the US spent tracking him. The hour upon hour of readings from the FBI transcripts that echo through the space present a cumulative portrait, both of Robeson himself – every gig, every meeting – and of the state and its paranoid intrusions.Almost every work here begs stories and interpretations. Even with so much missing, there’s complexity enough here, in its shuttles between the image and the backstory, proximity and distance, physical presence and psychological impact and affect. It gets under the skin.• Steve McQueen is at Tate Modern, London, 13 February to 11 May.

Email feast@thePlease explain tofu. It featured in three recipes in a recent edition of Feast, but I don’t know anything about it, or why I should cook with it. Can you help?Shelley, HertfordshireFuchsia Dunlop, one of the world’s great cheerleaders for Chinese cookery, often finds herself shaking her head at western preconceptions about tofu. “We tend to regard it as an ingredient that’s used almost exclusively by vegetarians,” she says, “but in China, and elsewhere in Asia, tofu is eaten by just about everybody.” That shouldn’t be at all surprising, considering this simple soya bean product is versatile, nutritious and a hugely rich source of protein. It’s very on-message with the west’s current dietary obsessions, too, so if anything, it’s odd that more of us don’t tuck into the stuff more regularly: “It’s a fantastic option for those trying to reduce the amount of animal protein they eat,” Dunlop adds, “be that for environmental, ethical or health reasons.”Put (very) simply, tofu is made from dried soya beans that are soaked in water, milled into soya milk, then strained, heated and coagulated, usually with mineral salts or gypsum (AKA fertiliser – yum!). The resulting curds are wrapped in muslin and pressed, leaving a block that can be cut into cubes, slices or strips. No wonder the British-Thai cook John Chantarasak compares the process to traditional cheese-making. “And, like cheese, tofu varies hugely in texture, from silken to extra-firm,” he says, “and the kind you use depends entirely on the desired end result in any given dish.”He’s not kidding about the variety out there, either. Plain white tofu, which comes in firmish slabs, is the most familiar over here – Dunlop describes it as “delicate and a bit like ricotta”. But there’s also “soft and custardy” silken (or flower) tofu smoked tofu fermented tofu, which usually comes in well-flavoured, often chilli-spiked oil and which Dunlop calls “the Chinese equivalent of ripe blue cheese” … I could go on, but you probably get the picture by now.According to Chantarasak, who hung up his apron at London’s Som Saa last year to set up his own venture, AngloThai, the Thais adopted tofu, or toa-hu as they call it, from China as long ago as the 13th century. It’s now so ingrained in the cooking culture that, traditionally, it’s a key ingredient in one of the country’s most famous dishes, pad thai, though it features only very rarely in versions made here it’s also a regular in mee krob, the popular crispy noodle street food. “Firm tofu is very forgiving,” Chantarasak says. “Cut it into cubes and stir-fry, then serve tossed with seasonal greens, garlic, oyster sauce and soy, or add it to curries and braises.”Silken tofu, as the name suggests, is much more fragile, so that’s best simply steamed: “Thinly sliced spring onion, ginger and a light dressing of soy, sugar and sesame oil are all you need to turn that into a great meal with a bowl of rice,” Chantarasak says.Let’s leave the last word to Dunlop, whose 2003 masterpiece, Sichuan Cookery, was reworked and republished as The Food of Sichuan late last year: “Tofu is not at all deserving of its western reputation as just a poor substitute for meat,” she says. “As entry points, try mapo tofu or sour-and-hot silken tofu, which are both deceptively easy.” They’re ridiculously quick, too – 10 minutes max – so there should be no holding Shelley back now.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

But Leeds didn’t fall apart and were notably resolute. They may not have won but they will take a lot of heart from this match.A horrible mistake from Kiko Casilla, not his first this season, let in Saïd Benrahma to open the scoring for Brentford. But another goalkeeping error, this time from David Raya, allowed Liam Cooper to equalise just before half-time. In the second half Leeds were totally dominant, Brentford’s BMW – Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo, Ollie Watkins – was on bricks. But despite two or three good chances the visitors were unable to convert their superiority into points.Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager, took his time in delivering his post-match remarks and barely looked up while he did so. “The players left everything on the pitch,” he said. “We defended well. It was difficult to attack for us even though we attacked all the match. But we controlled their attackers well, we managed the ball well and this is not easy against a team like Brentford who have great players.”Bielsa insisted his team played better at the weekend in their defeat by Nottingham Forest but Leeds were focused and determined from the off, only to fall behind. Casilla may have once worn the jersey of Real Madrid but he is looking like a real liability. Recent setbacks have been marked by Casilla errors and there was another, the Spaniard completely misreading a gentle backpass from Cooper, letting the ball run under a foot for Benrahma to score. Casilla pounded the turf in anger but, still, his teammates came over to help him up. “I don’t think Kiko needs my words, I always support him with decisions,” Bielsa said before acknowledging the collective support offered by the team. “I know the human quality of the players of Leeds, I think Casilla will receive support from his teammates and not lose confidence.”Up until their goal, Brentford had struggled. Their manager Thomas Frank confessed that while his team knew all about the intensity of the Leeds press (the Dane unpicked its characteristics in some detail) there was a difference between understanding it and being able to counter it. But after Benrahma’s opener they had their best spell and the flicks, tricks and clever movement started to come back into their play. Just past the half-hour and Luke Ayling did brilliantly to block a Benrahma effort after a cute dummy from Watkins.Leeds were down but they were not out and by half-time they were level. Their goal came from a corner, taken by Pablo Hernández. His delivery was accurate, coming down near the penalty spot into a crowd of players. Raya came to claim and got there but amid the bustle the goalkeeper was unable to keep his grip. The ball spilled and there was Cooper, the captain, to poke home into the roof of the net. He jogged back to the halfway line alone before celebrating with the raucous travelling fans.Leeds emerged for the second half with the same attitude but also with more belief. They had the measure of Brentford’s midfield and were sharp on the counter. Patrick Bamford should have scored within seven minutes of the restart but badly misjudged a free header from an Ayling cross.In the 58th minute, Bamford’s good play in a tight space released Hélder Costa down the right but after an interchange with Mateusz Klich, the winger could hit only a tame shot. A third chance came just after the hour but again Bamford’s connection left a lot to be desired as Jack Harrison picked him out for a shot on the edge of the box.The longer the game went on the more it became clear the only thing standing between Leeds and victory was themselves. And so it seemed a positive sign when Jean-Kévin Augustin came on for Bamford with 15 minutes to go.But the clock ran down without the RB Leipzig loanee, making only his second appearance, getting a proper chance. Hernández did at least test Raya in the dying stages but this time he was up to the task and tipped the Spaniard’s volley over.“Maybe they didn’t fear us but they knew it would be a difficult match. There’s a reason why we are where we are in the table and they definitely respect us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7f6e7430f692dbedc09f397f31b1cdb5a6627f/0_77_2811_1686/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e2036900b8dd2548f667e2ccebacd2a","title":"celtic refusing to co operate with sky sports after morelos mistranslation interview","story":"Celtic are refusing to co-operate with Sky Sports as the Scottish champions pursue a full explanation for a mistranslated interview with the Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos.In a major embarrassment for Sky, subtitles attached to Morelos, who spoke in Spanish, wrongly accused Celtic supporters of racially abusing the Colombian at the Old Firm match on 29 December.Sky’s reporters were not welcome at Celtic’s pre-match press conference for Wednesday’s game at home to Hearts, as had been the case before last Sunday’s Scottish Cup tie against Clyde. Such a move is not typical of Celtic and illustrates the scale of their feeling. The broadcaster faces a race to resolve the matter before its live screening of Aberdeen v Celtic on Sunday.After Celtic’s initial complaint, Sky admitted “inaccuracies” in the interview and removed it from all platforms before making a corrected version available. It said in a statement: “After numerous steps undertaken by Sky to verify the interview thoroughly we can be clear that at no point did Morelos allege that any racial abuse was directed at him by Celtic supporters in the interview. We apologise to the supporters of Celtic football club for this serious error. We are reviewing our procedures for translated interviews to ensure this does not occur in future.”There was, though, no detail offered publicly or privately as to how this situation arose. Celtic remain angry with what they regard as the unsatisfactory nature of Sky’s response and have reported the situation to Ofcom.This fall-out is all the more notable because Sky will begin an exclusive, five-year deal to screen live Scottish Premiership matches next season. Sky did not comment on this on Monday when approached by the . It has also been approached on Tuesday in relation to its lack of access to Celtic’s media briefings.Ofcom is looking through complaints from Celtic supporters as well as from the club. An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but have yet to decide whether or not to investigate.” This analysis typically takes around two weeks, with any formal investigation then usually completed within 50 working days.Celtic have specifically demanded to know who was responsible for the translation. “The use of mistranslation to convey false meaning is a dangerous form of fake news which must be condemned and sanctioned,” said the club’s chief executive, Peter Lawwell.Rangers are yet to say anything specifically about the misrepresentation of their player by Sky. Morelos’s representatives, World in Motion, did not comment when approached by the . The club did, though, issue a lengthy statement on Monday evening after it emerged that a 12-year-old had been charged in relation to a racist chant directed towards Morelos at Celtic Park. Rangers took aim at what they perceive as unfair treatment of their leading striker by the Scottish media.“Rangers had a duty of care not to say anything that might compromise a live Police Scotland investigation,” the statement said. “What none of us should ever do, however, is dismiss, or trivialise abusive behaviour as too many media outlets, journalists, and pundits have done in this instance.”It added: “When a player is at the centre of an abuse claim he is treated with respect and sensitivity and given support. That is certainly the case in England, but not here and most certainly not with Alfredo Morelos, who is actually being demonised in many quarters of the media.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c30239d45d2bf97d929306b5b55e1f073ad41f1/0_139_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c3ad269246df945786777d78a7fd43a","title":"mauricio pochettino would love premier league return","story":"Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked by Tottenham in November, would relish another opportunity to manage in the Premier League.Pochettino, who took over at White Hart Lane in May 2014 after leaving Southampton, guided the club to the Champions League final last season.However, following a run of inconsistent form which saw them drop out of contention for the top four, the Argentinian was sacked and swiftly replaced by José Mourinho. Before leaving Spurs, the 47-year-old had been linked with Manchester United, as well as Real Madrid.Speaking to Sky Sports’ In The Pink podcast, Pochettino revealed he would be tempted by another job in the English top flight if the right opportunity presented itself.“I would love to work in the Premier League,” he said. “It’s going to be difficult I know and for now it’s a moment to wait and we’ll see what happens. It’s a moment of recovery, to think about yourself a little bit, and to be ready because in football always something can happen and you need to be ready.“I’m ready and waiting for a new challenge. I have the belief and confidence that the next challenge will be fantastic.”Pochettino maintained there was nothing more than “rumours” at the moment.Despite the way his tenure ended, he remains “very proud about everything I achieved” at Spurs having been manager “at a pivotal moment for the club” before their stadium development.“Everything I had to do was very scary in those moments,” he said. “To destroy White Hart Lane and to build a new stadium, to play at Wembley and Milton Keynes, only football people know how difficult it was to deal with these situations.“To apply a new philosophy and new ideas was very tough but I feel very proud with the success we had and to take Tottenham to a different level.

This experience, although unenviable, pales in comparison to the experience of those trying to get over a former lover on Valentine’s Day.For those suffering from a serious case of the ex, Valentine’s Day is like an obstacle course. You have to dodge those smug, happy couples try not to commit crimes against them and go to bed wondering if you will die alone.Unfortunately, there are no over-the-counter remedies for this affliction. You could be find mature ways to deal with it – but who wants to do that? Instead, why not follow this handy little guide, which is petty enough to guarantee you will feel better.This Valentine’s Day, the San Antonio Zoo in Texas is offering up a sweet dose of fantasy to scorned ex-lovers. For just $5 you can name a cockroach after your ex and watch it get eaten, or for $25 you can treat them like the rat that they are by naming a frozen rodent after them and watching it get fed to a reptile.Why watch love go out in a burst of flames when you can watch it go down an animal’s throat instead?Exes are a lot like the glitter from Coachella you find in your belly button eight months after the fact: it felt like a good idea at the time but now you’re wondering how something so small could end up being so annoying, and whether you will ever truly be rid of it.Why not give your ex a taste of that fun feeling by sending them  a glitter bomb?Nothing says closure like knowing your ex won’t be able to stop thinking about you for at least as long as it takes to get rid of the stuff.Sometimes, with matters of the heart, it’s best to consult a witch. In the modern day, that means Google, where you can find a person who will curse your ex for you. All you have to do is to send them a photo of your ex and they will send back a voodoo doll representing said ex, with a different juju on each of their limbs.Here’s hoping that these aren’t proper, dangerous ones, but something more palatable. Like a curse that ensures the next person your ex kisses is carrying a minor but highly contagious virus.You know that saying, hell hath no fury like a person who’s had their inbox spammed? Well, it’s not actually a saying but it should be. Spam is the second-most annoying thing in the world after glitter, and luckily there are services that will fill your ex’s inbox up with spam for you (including one that sends cat spam).

It is one of 8,320 listed by Historic England, and beat off competition from an estimated 47,500 others in the rest of the UK.The friendly pub serves local beers, from brewers including  West Berkshire Brewery in Yattendon, Arkell’s in Swindon, Rebellion Brewery based in Marlow, and Loose Cannon in Abingdon, and its food includes homemade soup and fresh filled rolls.Known for its unspoiled interiors including gravy-coloured paint, the Bell Inn nestles in the tiny Berkshire hollow of Aldworth. A free house that has been in the hands of the Hunt, McQuhae and Macaulay family since the 18th century, it has two separate public rooms strikingly different in character.Off the central corridor is the tap room with vast inglenook fireplace, panelling, wall seating round three sides, scrubbed tables and benches, quarry-tiled floor and – bizarrely – a one-handed clock. The smaller bar area boasts ebony-handled pumps, which the great-grandmother of the present owner, Hugh Macaulay, had fitted in 1902, and which are still in use. The outside gents’ toilet is known – for obvious reasons after a few beers on a dark evening – as “the planetarium”, and was added in 1933 when mains water was installed.The Bell Inn last scooped the top award three decades ago, when it was run by Hugh’s parents, Heather and Ian Macaulay.Macaulay said: “The Bell Inn has been in my family for 250 years and my mother and father were running it when we last won the award. It’s a wonderful thing to be recognised for driving quality year after year. Not much has changed because we have kept our interior unspoilt all this time – and intend to keep it that way.”Pubs are selected for the competition by Camra volunteers and judged on their atmosphere, decor, welcome, service, community focus and beer quality. Runners-up this year include the Swan With Two Necks in Pendleton, Lancashire, the George \u0026amp Dragon in Hudswell, North Yorkshire and the Red Lion in Preston, Hertfordshire.Camra’s pub of the year organiser, Ben Wilkinson, said of the winner: “The judges were impressed with how a stranger entering the pub was treated like a regular straight away. It’s clear that the local customers use the pub as a community centre as well as a place to drink, and the warm welcome and knowledgable staff made us feel right at home. Nothing can beat the combination of good beer, great food and a warm heritage pub.”Heather Macaulay recalled how the pub booked one of the first private charter trips on Concorde for 100 of its customers in 1978. “We keep things plain and simple and we just tick along,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ed47329ccc9b4dcea577d5493a37a153c604f0/469_151_2321_1392/master/2321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c6668a6570edb8e28b0086552dddbfe","title":"ofcom to be given role of policing online platforms","story":"Culture secretary to present legislation despite concerns it could lead to censorshipThe broadcast watchdog, Ofcom, is to be handed responsibility for policing online platforms under government plans to be unveiled this week, it is understood.The government intends to present its draft legislation on online harm to MPs on Wednesday despite concerns from some critics that it could lead to censorship.Among the provisions due to be announced by Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, is the expanded role for Ofcom. It is understood the watchdog is to be given responsibility for ensuring that firms such as Twitter and Facebook comply with a new legal “duty of care” requiring them to protect their users from illegal material.The government launched its proposals to regulate internet firms more tightly last April. It was believed Boris Johnson intended to forge ahead with the plans in some form after his general election win, though there was initially little detail on how they would work.The prime minister turned to Morgan to put flesh on the bones. According to the Financial Times, which first reported the story, it will be for Ofcom to decide what would constitute a breach of that duty of care and what sanctions would be appropriate.Under the government’s original proposals, outlined in last year’s online harms white paper, a website that does not fulfil that duty of care would face a fine, its senior managers could be held criminally liable or the regulator could demand access to the site be blocked entirely.The duty of care proposal was also contained within the white paper, with the government saying at the time could hold internet firms liable for restricting “behaviours which are harmful but not necessarily illegal”.At the time, the government was forced to deny the plans would lead to a “North Korean-style censorship” regime, with critics concerned that a government regulator with power to block access to non-compliant platforms could find itself deciding which websites British internet users could visit.Questions also remain on how the regulations would deal with workarounds, such as VPNs, which allow internet users to obscure the origin of online traffic.The original proposals covered any website that “allows users to share or discover user-generated content, or interact with each other online” a broad definition that could cover much of the internet.Ofcom and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bf2a94165bec9c58d6122dd54d8f5b7eb440d/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4d07a1285c6c095c164e83654dca54e","title":"friends across the divide does labour have room for blairism and corbynism","story":"Peter Mandelson and Steve Howell represent the two opposite poles of the Labour party: one was a key architect of Blairism, the other of Corbynism.

There will not be general open-ended ongoing equivalence in financial services, nor other management or financial agreements with the United Kingdom,” Barnier said. “We will keep control of these tools, and we will retain the free-hand to take our own decisions.”Negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU are due to start in the first week of March.At the end of the transition period, the British financial services sector will no longer have the right to operate in the EU as it does today.The City will instead rely on Brussels judging that the UK’s regulations and supervisory systems are sufficiently robust – a so-called equivalence decision that can be overturned with as little as 30 days’ notice.The document photographed outside Downing Street said that Javid would instead be seeking “comprehensive, permanent equivalence decisions”, according to a report in the Financial Times.Such an equivalence deal could mean foreign companies such as investment firms and clearing houses can serve European customers largely from their home base and avoid having to set up a subsidiary in the EU.Barnier told MEPs that Brussels would not even engage in talks on the topic let alone be open to granting such a deal.He said: “We are not negotiating on these topics, rather we are checking that there is consistency and wherever possible granting equivalence on particular sectors of the financial industry.“That’s what we did with Canada, that’s what we did with the United States. It works. So I don’t see why it shouldn’t work with the United Kingdom.”While all the focus on Brexit talks has been on goods, the financial services chapter in any trade deal is critical for the UK. It employs more than 1 million people and contributes £127bn to the economy, according to Javid in an article in City AM on Tuesday.“We hope to agree a chapter on financial services in the UK-EU free trade agreement that establishes a baseline for the trading relationship,” the chancellor said.“If the EU, like us, wants a durable relationship, we should also include measures to directly address the long-term needs of industry for a reliable equivalence process.”He said this offered “the best solution to the question of agreeing our relationship with the EU this year” and was “important not only in the short term, but to establish the norms and ways of working with the EU that will endure for the decades to come”.The photograph of the briefing paper sets out two possible “landing zones” in talks with the EU.One would involve “selective equivalence” and a side deal committing to a “joint declaration on cooperation” which would kick in if the deal the government hopes to conclude by the end of the year does not include financial services.The second “landing zone” would be a “time-limited” agreement on financial services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me.

Scientists have found that dairy cows pass through a similar phase of emotional confusion that disturbs their otherwise rather stable personalities.The findings emerged from extensive observations of Holstein dairy cattle as they matured from calves to adulthood. “Our study identified a period of inconsistency in personality traits over puberty,” said Nina Von Keyserlingk, a professor of animal welfare at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Some animals became more shy during puberty and others became more bold. Some became less interested in nosing up to new people or objects while others became more so.The work sheds light on an under-studied realm of bovine life. Previous attempts to ascertain cattle personalities at different ages have found that they are reasonably stable in youth and in adulthood. Puberty, however, was something of a mystery.Von Keyserlingk and her former student Heather Neave assessed the cows for two personality traits by placing them in a test arena and watching how they behaved alone and around unfamiliar objects or strangers. The scientists ranked the animals first for boldness and second for how eager they were to explore. The tests were performed on calves at the ages of one and three months, one year and two and a half years.The findings, reported in Royal Society Open Science, suggest that while cows have stable personalities as calves and adults, in between those ages when puberty hits their behaviour becomes less predictable.Scientists hope that understanding cattle personalities and how they might vary with age will help improve animal health and farming practices. Previous studies have found that cows that become more stressed tend to eat less, grow slower, have weaker immune systems and produce less milk.“Our overall goal is to improve the lives of animals on farms,” said Neave. “Ideally, in the future, management practices would be tailored to the inidual rather than the herd, so that all calves and cows have an opportunity to thrive on the farm and reach their full productive potential.”Lori Marino, a neuroscientist and executive director of the Utah-based Kimmela Center for Animal Advocacy, said she was not surprised by the findings, as puberty was “a time of tremendous change both physically and emotionally”.Marino, who co-authored a recent study, The Psychology of Cows, added: “It is a time when humans, too, are quite volatile in their moods and personality traits. This finding again demonstrates how similar we all are, whether we are cows or primates.“Of course, it makes pubescents less predictable and that can translate into how we interact with them. But in the end it tells us that if cows and humans share so much of their psychology with each other, we need to look at cows as beings who also have feelings about being farmed and having their children taken away from them in the dairy industry.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0771789b9669d2877516dcb1e2479e3cbe00b0f2/0_48_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=674b2754ef95b147ea16ac05541e6b1c","title":"universal credit could steamroll vulnerable into poverty salvation army","story":"Exclusive: Salvation Army calls on government to make it easier for people to access the benefitThousands of vulnerable people on low incomes – particularly those with mental illness – are at risk of destitution because they do not have the skills or support to apply for and maintain a universal credit benefit claim, the Salvation Army has warned.The Christian church and charity said there was “overwhelming evidence” that many people found it a struggle to engage with the mainly digital benefit, leaving them unable to pay rent or buy food and effectively locking them out of employment support.Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. About 2 million people are currently in receipt of UC. More than 6 million will be on the benefit by the time it is fully rolled out.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbspmean it is now seven years behind schedule, and rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit.The original design set out a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.It called on the government to increase the level of support to make it simpler for vulnerable people to make a claim before the next phase of the universal credit programme later this year, when about 750,000 ill and disabled benefit claimants start to be moved on to the benefit.“Rolling out universal credit in its current form will steamroll vulnerable people into poverty, but the government has time to turn this around by accepting our recommendations and making it easier to apply,” said Rebecca Keating, the Salvation Army’s employment director said.There is concern among campaigners and even the government’s own social security advisers that the government has not done enough to ensure vulnerable claimants do not fall out of the system altogether when they are transferred to universal credit in the process called managed migration, which is due to start in late autumn.Claimants with mental health problems, learning disabilities and physical disabilities, as well as homeless people were especially at risk, it said. Some lacked computer skills, or could not access the internet because they did not own a smart phone or because there was no public computer nearby.The charity cited the case of Daniel, a young man with dyslexia, who struggled to read and write. He had his benefits stopped and ended up homeless after putting the wrong phone number on his online form and missing a text appointment with the job centre.Although Daniel was allocated a key worker he said the extent of his dyslexia was never fully understood. “I needed things explained to me properly and I couldn’t read all the leaflets he was giving me to go away with. That went on for six months,” he said.Some of those who managed to sign up to universal credit subsequently dropped out after being sanctioned for failing to keep up with its tough conditionality requirements, such as 35 hours a week of online job searches. These rules, known as claimant commitments, often did not take a person’s vulnerabilities into accountThe charity insisted it wanted universal credit to be a success, but it had a duty to point out where it was going wrong. “This is not just another paper for decision-makers to ignore and label as scaremongering,” it said. “These are people’s lives.“We are not saying ‘bin universal credit, it’s no good’ this is about us wanting to make the system work,” said Keating. “Digital works for a lot of people but there is a significant group of people that it is not working for.”A DWP spokesperson said: “Jobcentres across the UK have staff trained in supporting vulnerable people and tailor people’s benefit claims to match their circumstances, including taking into account mental health, issues with domestic abuse and homelessness.”The Salvation Army’s research was based on interviews between March and June 2019 with 160 people across England and Wales who were out of work and looking for a job and had signed up to the charity’s Employment Plus programme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e86c0a995605b560414527e77404149eba503f/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c895201ee6d270bdf4aa276a79413b84","title":"have you been affected by changes to disability welfare payments","story":"We’d like you to help us document how problems with welfare benefits have affected people with disabilities.

One club owner described the move as “showing contempt” for the Championship, suggesting the league could be reduced to amateur status in “two or three years”.The move has been described as Premiership ring-fencing “by default”, with Saracens set to be relegated into a league beset by financial strife next season. “The RFU has handed ring-fencing to the Premiership on a plate and they’ve paid nothing for it,” added a Championship source. “They’ve just given it away.”The 12 clubs were informed of the measures at a committee meeting on Tuesday. They receive around £550,000 in funding but halving that at such short notice will be “catastrophic”, according to one source, with another suggesting it could leave 200 players without clubs.Premiership Rugby Limited, which contributes to Championship funding, has been seeking to pull up the drawbridge but failed in its attempts to implement an end to relegation for the start of this season. The tier-two clubs will now have to operate on significantly lower budgets and, with a host of players on long-term contracts, some clubs face considerable upheaval to stay afloat let alone push for promotion.“It’s the RFU saying it doesn’t want the Championship,” the Nottingham chairman, Alistair Bow, said. “The Premiership has had a lot of influence over all the decisions regarding the Championship, certainly for the 10 years I’ve been involved. I do strongly believe the actions the RFU has taken have handed PRL everything on a plate and without having to pay a penny for it. The RFU has handed English professional rugby … everything, to the hands of PRL.”“It’s not a money-saving exercise, it’s more to do with value for money,” Bow said. “Either the RFU has been very badly informed, or misinformed. I don’t think they know what the cuts will do for a club like Nottingham. It’s nothing more than contempt for what we’re trying to do for the sport as a whole. I just wonder if these people at the RFU who make these decisions have ever run a proper business.”PRL has long been trumpeting its A League as an alternative second tier for English rugby and, emboldened by its cash injection of more than £200m, appears to have got its way. One source suggested the Championship had “fallen victim to the cartel that is PRL”, while another said there has been a lack of explanation from the RFU for the cuts.“The bit that’s frustrating is what is the rationale behind the savage cut in funding? Are they rugby reasons or is it purely financial,” a Championship director of rugby said. “It’s a massive backwards step.“The RFU obviously don’t see us as part of the pathway programme which is a bit sad really given what the Championship has done for the Premiership and England over the years. What about the coaching pathway, where are they going to cut their teeth, what about the refereeing pathway? Five or six years ago they were saying we had to all be fully professional. Now, suddenly, they say you have to be firmly part-time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d14522830da77f2b184cff04f41519f0c224ab/117_0_4770_2861/master/4770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad66ad5cb3f67908cd0845da7c45ed4f","title":"shauna coxsey climbing tokyo 2020 olympics","story":"Climbing will make its debut at the 2020 Olympics and Shauna Coxsey will be the first British competitor and one of only 20 women climbers in TokyoShauna Coxsey can only laugh when asked how she feels about being dubbed Britain’s very own Spider-Woman. “I don’t really know what to say,” admits the 27-year-old. All the media attention before her Olympic debut this summer is certainly new not only for Coxsey but for the sport she has devoted her life to since the age of four.Climbing is one of five events making their Olympic debuts this summer in Tokyo, and as the most successful British exponent, it is fitting Coxsey is Team GB’s first qualifier. “I would watch the Olympics as a kid and be inspired but also quite disconnected too,” she says after being named in the British team on Tuesday. “You felt as a climber that you’d never get to that level. To get that chance now is incredible.”Tokyo will be a watershed for Coxsey and British climbing but it has not arrived without controversy. Coxsey is a master of the bouldering discipline of the sport, which requires competitors to navigate paths to the top of a previously unseen wall, rope-free, against the clock. But at the Olympics, the three major disciplines of climbing – speed, bouldering and lead – have been united which, when the scores are multiplied together, will create one combined total that will determine the medals.It is a move that has caused considerable disquiet in the climbing community. “The reaction was one of confusion initially,” Coxsey says. “There was a bit of upset but when we learned from the IOC why it has happened, it was evident it was the right decision. It’s going to showcase the best of our sport across the disciplines. I think the crowds are going to be amazed with what they see.”Coxsey, a winner of the bouldering World Cup on two occasions, has had to intensify her rigorous regime to ready her for multiple disciplines. Tokyo will be the culmination of a journey that began in Runcorn before she had even started school, when she was captivated by the leading French mountain climber Catherine Destivelle. “I saw Catherine climbing up these cliffs in Africa when I was four and I was just in awe,” she says.“From there, we found a local centre and my dad helped teach me. As kids we all climb trees and want to get as high as possible. We stop when we’re older but there’s no reason to do that, is there? Hopefully this summer we will show you can still do it and have fun no matter what your ability. Climbing is something everyone can relate to from their childhood.”Only 20 women will compete for the climbing medals in Japan. Coxsey is likely to be the only British inclusion with a brutal final qualifier taking place in Moscow in April. In Tokyo she will face competition from Slovenia’s Janja Garnbret and the Japanese climber Akiyo Noghuci. Any thought of a podium finish is far from Coxsey’s mind yet.“I train at lots of different places – I’ve even got a climbing wall built in my cellar, which is really cool,” Coxsey says. “I have access to a lot of different stuff but it’s between four and eight hours a day, usually for six or seven days a week. There’s some off-the-wall training too I’ve been strengthening my fingers to get them ready for all the disciplines. It’s tough but I wouldn’t change it for the world.”Speed climbing forces competitors to ascend 15m as quickly as possible. Lead involves trying to climb as high as possible while tethered to the wall within an allotted time period.It sounds confusing initially, but Coxsey is confident the public will be quickly enamoured. “I think it’s going to be incredible,” she says, smiling. “When you’re at a climbing event, the buzz you get from a crowd is just incredible.“As a spectator it’s going to be insane to watch all these different disciplines and different elements going on. We can all relate to climbing. It’s tough for us, to train for them all … but it’s going to be fun for everyone else.”As a multiple British champion and two-times World Cup winner, Coxsey has scaled the proverbial wall already during her career. Tokyo, with its mainstream spotlight and attention, provides Coxsey and climbing with a new opportunity to shine. “Our sport really does meet the Olympic motto of faster, higher, stronger. To be here now, preparing for the Olympics and being involved with Team GB is incredible. If more people see us showcasing that you can climb regardless of your age, that’ll be amazing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e593a2cb21782dbb259adfa0cc677b495010a3d7/0_0_5109_3066/master/5109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79445f62adecac7c1204ca67a99535aa","title":"uk sport launches review into uk athletics","story":"UK Sport has begun an unprecedented comprehensive review into UK Athletics after admitting it had “major concerns” following a series of crises, scandals and poor decisions that have plunged the organisation into disarray.The independent review, which comes only five months before the Tokyo Olympics, will examine “the strategy, leadership, governance, operation, culture and connectivity of UK Athletics” to ensure it is “fit for the future”.UK Sport, which has funded UK Athletics to the tune of £27m since 2017 in its role overseeing all Olympic sports in Britain and Northern Ireland, has taken the step despite two independent reviews already having been recently commissioned to look at the actions of the organisation.In recent months UK Athletics lost its chief executive Zara Hyde Peters before she started in the role when she stepped down after failing to disclose to her local athletics club her husband’s “inappropriate relationship” with a 15-year-old girl. The governing body also faced intense criticism over its relationship with the coach Alberto Salazar, who is appealing against a four-year ban for doping offences.To make matters worse, UK Athletics has also lost its performance director and chair, failed to hit its medal target at the recent world championships, and has a £2m hole in its finances following the decision to stage the 2018 World Cup on the same weekend as the Wimbledon finals and football World Cup.The competence of UK Athletics was also questioned after it named a reserve shot putter into the line up of the men’s 4x400m team at the 2019 European Athletics Team Championships – leading to the team to be disqualified from the race.The sport’s governing body also suffered an embarrassing logistics failure ahead of last year’s world championships after hammer thrower Nick Miller had to relocate away from the team holding camp in Dubai because there were inadequate facilities.Announcing the review, UK Sport said UK Athletics had faced a series of significant challenges that had “had an adverse impact on both the sport and the reputation of the sport”.In an unusually strong statement the UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, said: “Issues raised in recent months regarding the sport are of major concern to both UK Sport and to the leadership team at UK Athletics. Both organisations are committed to delivering long-term improvement and ensuring the sustainability of the sport while acting in the best interests of its athletes, staff and the wider athletics family.”UK Sport said the initial review would be led by Dame Sue Street, a former permanent secretary at the department for digital, culture, media and sport, and would be completed by April. “Our aim in commissioning this first stage review is to ensure we have a full understanding of the priority issues and any next steps required to help the sport move forward,” Munday said.Last month UK Athletics’ first performance director, Malcolm Arnold, said the sport was in its worst state for 60 years having largely squandered the legacy of London 2012 and people needed to “wake up” to the scale of the problem.Arnold pointed out that while Britain has a handful of exceptional athletes such as Dina Asher-Smith, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Laura Muir, the talent pool has shrunk significantly owing to the “dreadful neglect” of elite athlete and coaching development by UK Athletics and poor decisions.UK Athletics recently announced independent reviews into safeguarding in the sport as well as its controversial decision to allow Mo Farah to continue working with Salazar despite a BBC Panorama documentary in June 2015 raising questions about the coach’s practices at the Nike Oregon Project. At the time an internal UK Athletics investigation found there was “no reason to be concerned” about Salazar and cleared Farah, who denies any wrongdoing, to remain with him.In a statement UK Athletics said it welcomes the latest review. “We are pleased to have the support of UK Sport on a wide range of issues and the review will sit alongside and complement this work and is a further step in building a strong future for the sport.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3f18fe535e2da40b6e5cfdcdefaeb4c398261b6/0_26_3311_1986/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cda835527e91b012f16acc271de91be2","title":"talking horses tiger roll grand national","story":"The chances of the two-times winner of the Aintree showpiece going for a third victory remain in the balanceTiger Roll negotiated another step on the path back to Aintree and an attempt to win a historic third Grand National on Tuesday, as the decision to compress his handicap mark by only 1lb prompted an expression of disappointment from his owners and a suggestion Michael O’Leary’s 10-year-old remains “50-50” to run in the world’s most famous steeplechase on 4 April.Given some of the rumblings from the O’Leary camp in the run-up to the publication of the National weights, that has to be seen as a positive. Eddie O’Leary, racing manager for his brother’s Gigginstown Stud operation, had suggested he had “a figure” in his head and that “if he hits that figure he runs and if he doesn’t, he won’t be running”. Whatever his figure was, it surely was not “1”, yet for the moment at least, Tiger Roll is still a contender.Tiger Roll’s owners are a little put out, in other words but a long way from deciding to take their bat home. O’Leary’s comments are also a useful reminder that while what could be the biggest racing story for half a century is still a possibility, there are several more obstacles to negotiate before a third tilt at the National is even a shade of odds-on.First, a horse that has already suffered one injury setback this year needs to come through his first start since last year’s Grand National at Navan this weekend. It is a race he won – at 25-1, no less – last season but no similar heroics are anticipated this time around. “Pulled up with a smile on his face” will suffice for Tiger Roll’s owners.Even then, Tiger Roll still needs to meet the entry requirement that National runners must have run over fences in the current season. If he were to miss the Cross-Country at Cheltenham in March for any reason, he could be fit and well again on the morning of 4 April but barred from running in the race he has made his own over the last two years. There is a strong sense of many twists and turns to come on the road ahead.The prospect of Tiger Roll attempting to emulate – and in some senses, surpass – Red Rum has been captivating racing fans since he crossed the line at Aintree last year.Few of us, after all, ever thought we would see a dual winner again, as the modern National is more ferociously competitive than ever and pretty much every one of the 40 runners will go to post with at least an outside chance. A three-times winner is the stuff of fantasy.It is a story that still needs to be taken episode by episode, with no mental flicking through the box set to a potential date with destiny in early April but the dream is still alive, and it remains a distinct possibility that Liverpool will be at the centre of the sporting world not once, but twice this spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/880ab631d6eb96a46f9b36ed74ee7272bb0c8916/0_0_5657_3711/master/5657.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2ee61c64f5c137c349d771cd8844a330","title":"3 tutu 1 go ballet superstars backstage in pictures colin jones","story":"Colin Jones trained as a dancer before becoming a photographer.

Its previous folding phone, the Galaxy Fold, which opened out like a book into a tablet was plagued with reliability problems.As shown in an advert during the Oscars before the phone’s launch, the Galaxy Z Flip has a small display on the front to show notifications such as who is calling, alongside a main dual-camera lump reminiscent of traditional smartphones.The hinge opens upwards, locking flat to reveal the screen, which resembles Samsung’s more traditional Note 10 and new S20 smartphones with a small pin-hole selfie camera at the top of the display. The hinge can hold the phone open at 45 degrees, leaving the display operational for uses such as video calling.Samsung hopes that the Galaxy Z Flip’s combination of compact form factor, large screen and novelty element will make it the first folding-screen phone success.Having learned some hard lessons with the Galaxy Fold, which was pulled because of durability problems and ultimately revised for a delayed release, “Samsung is unquestionably the most advanced player when it comes to smartphones with flexible displays”, said Ben Wood, the research chief at CCS Insight.“The Galaxy Z Flip builds on that experience and it is immediately apparent that Samsung has gone to the next level in terms of hinge design and the finesse of the product, in particular the folding glass that protects the display.”Until now, a plastic covering was required to enable the display to fold. But the coverings of Galaxy Fold and competitors such as Huawei’s Mate X and Motorola’s recently released Razr, are easy to mark and scratch.

The 93-year-old – who recently warned that humans had “overrun the world” while promoting another upcoming project, A Life on Our Planet, with Netflix and the WWF – will look at phenomena including the Indian monsoon and Arctic winters in the five-part series.Attenborough seems set to continue his environmentalist streak in the series, with an episode dedicated to the “force of nature” that is human activity. In a statement, the naturalist said “a new dominant force is changing the face of Earth: humans. To preserve our perfect planet we must ensure we become a force for good.”The BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, described A Perfect Planet as a “breathtaking series celebrating the intricate systems that allow our planet to thrive, bringing together a unique perspective with groundbreaking camera technology.”Attenborough’s climate crisis message has become more explicit recently, notably with shows including BBC One’s Climate Change: The Facts and his debut Netflix project, Our Planet. Previously, his 2017 series Blue Planet II – a follow-up to his hit 2001 programme Blue Planet – raised awareness of single-use plastic.The five-part programme is set to air on BBC One and Discovery later in the year.

The CIA’s success over many years is likely to reinforce current US suspicions of equipment made by the Chinese company Huawei.Neither China or the Soviet Union bought Crypto encryption devices, suspicious of the company’s origins, but it was sold to more than 100 other countries.Carolina Bohren, a spokeswoman for the Swiss defence ministry, said in an emailed statement: “The events under discussion date back to 1945 and are difficult to reconstruct and interpret in the present day context.”Bohren said that following media inquiries about the company, the Swiss government appointed a former federal supreme court judge, Niklaus Oberholzer, in January to “investigate and clarify the facts of the matter” and report back to the defence ministry in June.Meanwhile, Switzerland has suspended foreign sales of Crypto products.At their height, Operations Thesaurus and Rubicon provided the US with a powerful intelligence edge. When Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin were hosted by the former president Jimmy Carter at Camp David in 1978 to negotiate an Egyptian-Israeli peace accord, the US was able to monitor all Sadat’s communications with Cairo.Iran was also a Crypto customer, allowing CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA) to spy on the revolutionary government in Tehran during the 1979 hostage crisis. US intelligence was also able to eavesdrop on Libyan officials congratulating each other on the 1986 bombing of a Berlin disco.According to the CIA’s history, the US passed on intercepted communications about Argentinian military plans to the UK during the Falklands war, exploiting Argentina’s reliance on Crypto encryption equipment.The CIA and BND agreed the purchase of Crypto in 1970 but, fearing exposure, the BND sold its share of the company to the US in the early 1990s. According to the Washington Post, the CIA continued to exploit the company until 2018, when it sold the company’s assets to two private companies.One of those companies, CyOne Security, which is run by former top Crypto employees, issued a statement saying it could not comment on Crypto’s history.The firm did not respond to follow-up questions over how it could be completely independent of Crypto, having inherited its top staff.Crypto’s foreign sales business was sold to a Swedish entrepreneur, Andreas Linde. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment but expressed shock when informed by journalists last month about Crypto’s history.“If what you are saying is true, then absolutely I feel betrayed, and my family feels betrayed, and I feel there will be a lot of employees who will feel betrayed as well as customers,” Linde was quoted as saying by the Washington Post, which described him as “visibly shaken”.In a later interview, Linde said his company was checking all its products for hidden vulnerabilities.“We have to make a cut as soon as possible with everything that has been linked to Crypto,” he said.Crypto’s origins lie in the great conflicts of the 20th century. Its founder, Boris Hagelin, was born in Russia but fled to Sweden during the Russian Revolution. He escaped to the US when the Nazis invaded Norway in 1940, and sold his portable encryption machine to US forces.In the US, Hagelin became friends with William Friedman, who is considered the father of American cryptology, and they remained close after Hagelin moved his company to Switzerland after the war. The two men made a secret agreement in 1951, in the Cosmos Club in Washington, to restrict sales of its sophisticated encryption products to countries approved by the US.When encryption technology evolved from mechanical to electronic in the 1960s, the NSA manipulated the algorithms used by Crypto devices, so they could be quickly decoded. The company started making two versions of its machines – secure models sold to friendly governments and rigged systems for everyone else – before being taken over outright by the CIA and the BND.The security of Crypto equipment began arousing suspicions after Ronald Reagan made public claims about US intercepts of Libyan officials involved in the 1986 bombing of the Berlin disco, La Belle. Iranian intelligence became suspicious and questioned a Crypto salesman, Hans Buehler, but took no action until about six years later, when they arrested Buehler as he was about to fly out of Tehran. Iran released him only after the company agreed to pay $1m, with funds provided by the BND.Most of Crypto’s workforce was unaware of the company’s secret, but in 1977, an engineer who had grown suspicious of its algorithms was fired after he traveled to Damascus and fixed the vulnerabilities in the firm’s products operated by the Syrian government.The link between US intelligence and Crypto was first reported by the Baltimore Sun in 1995, leading several countries to stop buying from the company. Bizarrely, however, Iran continued to purchase Crypto equipment for several years. Asked why he had not asked more questions about the company he was buying, Linde, the new owner of Crypto International, said he viewed the allegations as “just rumours”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8558740d2f2d629d6378964da0aa74a530bc7e0c/0_108_3233_1939/master/3233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=171bb79943fb0f7839a42928258c7d44","title":"judges should not rule by own beliefs says conservative clarence thomas","story":"‘We are not mass media icons,’ says supreme court justice, the subject of a new biography and film, as he opens judicial centre in AtlantaJudges must not bend rulings to their own racial, religious or partisan preferences and instead uphold the rule of law even when it leads to unpopular decisions, the US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas said on Tuesday.“Each time a judge sidesteps or manipulates the law to achieve his or her desired outcome, the rule of law suffers and is undermined and eventually compromised,” Thomas said in Atlanta, during the dedication of a judicial centre that will house Georgia’s supreme, appeals and business courts.In some circles, his remarks might be met with skepticism.Thomas is widely held to be the most resolutely conservative member of a court now controlled by a rightwing majority after two controversial appointments by Donald Trump.In a 2014 analysis, for example, the New York Times rated the George HW Bush appointee “the member of the court most likely to disagree with its liberal wing”. In 2016, the New Yorker said that though Thomas had a “highly idiosyncratic” view of the US constitution, he was “a great deal more conservative than his colleagues, and arguably the most conservative justice to serve on the supreme court since the 1930s”.Last year, Thomas urged his colleagues on the court to be less devoted to upholding the principle of legal precedent. In a case involving gun possession, he wrote: “When faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it.”Analysts suggest that such an approach could lead to the overturning of such decisions as Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court ruling which legalized abortion and remains a key target of the conservative movement.Thomas has also been influential in key conservative victories, including around gun controls and campaign finance. In the words of the website Oyez, a project run by Cornell University and Chicago-Kent College of Law which seeks to make the supreme court accessible to the public: “Though Thomas is known for his lack of engagement in the oral arguments, his intellect is indispensable to his conservative cohorts.”Thomas, who was born in Pin Point, near Savannah, noted on Tuesday that it was not long since courthouses like the one being dedicated were segregated. Segregation endured not only because of prejudices and a lack of understanding, he said, but because of a “lack of courage among those who knew or should have known better, especially in the judicial branch of government”.Having the courage to uphold the rule of law may lead judges to decisions that are not popular, Thomas said.“Our decisions should not be driven by a desire to be revered or lionised for reaching certain outcomes,” he said. “We are not mass media icons. We are judges, nothing more and nothing less.”Though perhaps not the “mass media icon” that fellow justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has become to many on the left, Thomas is well-known.In 1991 his confirmation hearings were attended by high drama over accusations of sexual misconduct. Two decades later, he is the subject of both a new biographical study, The Enigma of Clarence Thomas, and a new documentary film.In the film, Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words, the 71-year-old justice, known for rarely asking questions in supreme court hearings, speaks to camera for close to two hours.In its review, Variety called the film “a monologue of self-justification, a two-hour infomercial for the decency, the competence, and the conservative role-model aspirationalism of Clarence Thomas”.Director Michael Pack, meanwhile, told the Federalist: “I think he just got tired of having his story coming out in a distorted form. He got tired of his enemies and the people who don’t like him spreading half-truths and misrepresentations and outright lies, actually, sometimes about him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/462f56bc421a7af779240ea3208f2ea7155d79cd/0_113_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e89b0a158237b4529663ca705a4646ab","title":"new hampshire primary results exit poll live bernie sanders pete buttigieg latest 2020 updates","story":"Addressing supporters in South Carolina, Joe Biden shrugged off his disappointing showing in New Hampshire, where he is currently in fifth place.“We need to hear from Nevada and South Carolina and Super Tuesday states and beyond,” Biden said. “It ain’t over, man. We’re just getting started.”Biden’s campaign manager echoed that sentiment over Twitter:However, Biden’s back-to-back disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire could make some of his supporters, including African-American Democrats, question whether he is capable of defeating Trump. Some polls indicate black voters are already drifting away from Biden after he finished in fourth place in the Iowa caucuses, so he will need a strong performance in next week’s Nevada caucuses to shift the narrative.As the New Hampshire results show Elizabeth Warren in fourth place, Trump insulted the Massachusetts senator, saying she is having a “really bad night” and once again referring to her as “Pocahontas.”Tom Steyer just released a statement to make clear that he is definitely not dropping out of the race, despite a previous false report to the contrary:Just as we saw in Iowa last week, tonight’s results from New Hampshire show that the race for the Democratic nomination is wide open. Until Nevada and South Carolina have the chance to vote, we won’t know which candidates can build the erse and unified coalition we need to win in November.To beat Donald Trump, we need to expose him as a fraud and failure on the economy, and we need to build a erse, national coalition. I believe the candidates who do well in Nevada and South Carolina will head into Super Tuesday with the proven ability to build such a erse coalition. Joe Biden addressed supporters at his primary night event in New Hampshire via livestream, as the former vice president campaigned in South Carolina.“Now we are moving on Nevada and South Carolina and beyond, beyond,” Biden told a small group of his supporters gathered in Nashua. “We’ll see you in the general.”Despite a previous report to the contrary, billionaire activist Tom Steyer has not dropped out of the presidential primary.Correction: A previous version of this post cited an incorrect report that Steyer had dropped out of the race.It’s becoming increasingly clear that Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren will not be able to break into the top three tonight.Biden has spent the week since the Iowa caucuses lowering expectations for his performance in New Hampshire, insisting his campaign will take off once voting reaches more racially erse states like Nevada and South Carolina.However, it will still be difficult for him to explain his performance if he cannot reach double digits.Still, tonight’s results in New Hampshire might be even harder to spin for Elizabeth Warren, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts. Warren had climbed to the top of New Hampshire polls in the fall, and her disappointing performance will almost certainly spark questions about what path she now has to the nomination.But Bennet, who focused his campaign efforts on New Hampshire, recently told CNN that he wanted to see the primary through before dropping out.In a sign of how terribly this night is going for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, neither candidate is expected to win any delegates from New Hampshire.Tonight’s New Hampshire primary has claimed its second victim: Colorado senator Michael Bennet. Echoing Andrew Yang, Bennet said he would suspend his campaign after a disappointing finish in New Hampshire, where he needed a standout performance.Addressing supporters in Manchester, Andrew Yang said the numbers were not there for him to claim a path to the nomination, calling his decision to drop out “bitterly disappointing.”Yang said he would support the eventual Democratic nominee and expressed hope that his campaign had offered “caution and guidance” on how to confront Trump.

In fact, it has been established for at least two decades that there is something called the 2080 rule – that a small core group of about one in five people transmit infections to far more people than the majority do.It seems so. The third British case, after the first two diagnosed in York, was a man in his 50s who contracted the coronavirus infection at a conference in Singapore. He then travelled to France where he stayed with his family in a ski chalet in the Alpine resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie. Five people who were in the chalet, including a boy of nine, have tested positive for coronavirus since the man came back to the UK on an easyJet flight and was diagnosed in Brighton. Another Briton who was on holiday in the chalet flew back to his home in Mallorca and was admitted to hospital in Palma. The chief medical officer said four more people had tested positive in England – all of whom were also on the skiing holiday in France.Among delegates to the Singapore conference was a man who flew in from Wuhan, China, who may himself have been a super-spreader. A number of others who were there and returned to other countries, in addition to the British man at the centre of the ski chalet cluster, are said to have fallen ill.There are a number of theories, but no definite answer. Some speculate that it is to do with the immune system of the super-spreader, which may not be good at suppressing the virus or alternatively may be so good that they do not feel symptoms themselves so carry on transmitting it to others. But it is likely to be caused by multiple factors, possibly including getting a higher dose of the virus in the first place or being infected with more than one pathogen. One thing seems certain – it is impossible to know who will be a super-spreader and who will not.Yes. Super-spreaders have been documented as far back as the early 1900s, when one woman infected 51 people with typhoid, even though she had no symptoms herself. More recently, one student at a high school in Finland infected 22 others with measles in 1998, even though eight of them had been vaccinated. Two people are thought to have infected 50 others with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1995. In the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, most people were not very infectious, but a few super-spreaders in Singapore appear to have transmitted the virus to as many as 10 people each.The government says the measures, including powers to detain people in quarantine or in isolation, are in line with other countries and the risk to the UK remains “moderate”. But the cluster of cases emerging from the Singapore hotel followed by the French ski chalet and arriving in the UK will reinforce the ease with which any virus can travel the world via super-spreaders. There will be particular concern that people can be infected without any symptoms that would alert them or other people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7943b8bbf8f9a494017823d3fddec9e82853b7bf/0_198_4084_2451/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a96cb8f85cffb0df22663f897382313","title":"coronavirus vaccine could be ready in 18 months says who","story":"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says vaccine for COVID-19 virus could be 18 months awayThe new coronavirus devastating Chinese cities and spreading into many other countries around the world is “a very grave threat”, the director general of the World Health Organization has warned, comparing its potential with that of terrorism.“Viruses can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, after an international meeting of 400 scientists and other experts convened in Geneva to look for solutions to the crisis.With an estimated 18 months until the first vaccine is available, “we have to do everything today using available weapons,” he said. The rising number of diagnoses in patients who had never visited China could be the “tip of the iceberg”, he added.Tedros said the virus had been named COVID-19, explaining that it was important to avoid stigma and that other names could be inaccurate.Under a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika – where those diseases were first identified, and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public mind.People’s names – usually referring to the scientists who identified the disease – are also banned, as are “terms that incite undue fear” such as “unknown” or “fatal”, the WHO said.The world must “wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one,” said Tedros.Earlier Hong Kong’s leading public health epidemiologist, one of the experts called to Geneva for the meeting, told the  that the coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it could not be controlled.The virus has killed more than 1,000 people, infected more than 42,000 and reached at least 25 countries, with the WHO declaring a global health emergency.Leung planned to tell the WHO meeting that the main issue was the scale of the growing worldwide epidemic, and the second priority was to find out whether the drastic measures taken by China to prevent the spread had worked – because if so, other countries should think about adopting them.The meeting brings together more than 400 researchers and national authorities, including some participating by video conference from mainland China and Taiwan. To date, China has reported 42,708 confirmed cases, including 1,017 deaths.Experts also need to know whether restrictions in the centre of Wuhan and other cities have reduced infections. “Have these massive public health interventions, social distancing and mobility restrictions worked in China?” he asked. “If so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?”If China’s lockdown has not worked, there is another unpalatable truth to face: that the coronavirus might not be possible to contain. Then the world will have to switch tracks: instead of trying to contain the virus, it will have to work to mitigate its effects.For now, containment measures are essential. Leung said the period of time during which people were infected but showed no symptoms remained a huge problem. Quarantine was necessary, but to ensure people were not still carrying the virus when they left, everybody should ideally be tested every couple of days. If anyone within a quarantine camp or on a stricken cruise ship tested positive, the clock should be reset to 14 days more for all the others.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.Some countries at risk because of the movement of people to and from China have taken precautions. On a visit to Thailand three weeks ago, Leung talked to the health minister and advised the setting up of quarantine camps, which the government has done. But other countries with links to China appear, inexplicably, to have no cases – such as Indonesia. “Where are they?” he asked.Tedros asked countries to be “as aggressive as possible” in fighting the coronavirus.“If the world doesn’t want to wake up and consider the virus as public enemy number one, I don’t think we will learn from our lessons,” he said. “We are still in containment strategy and should not allow the virus to have a space to have local transmission.“We are not defenceless,” Tedros added. “If we invest now … we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.”No specific treatment or vaccine against the virus exists. The WHO has repeatedly urged countries to share data in order to further research into the disease. “That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences. To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity,” Tedros told the scientific conference.He said he hoped the scientists could agree a roadmap “around which researchers and donors will align”.Several teams of experts in Australia, Britain, China, France, Germany and the US are racing to develop a vaccine – a process that normally takes years.Efforts to come up with a vaccine are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.Ultimately, however, scientists may end up in the same situation they were in during the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) – which died out before a vaccine could be fully developed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5c909ed0b198dc4530ce751650ba37f4338050/1103_478_3759_2255/master/3759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=795cc79f358541cbbc05ec80c4e07fb2","title":"ireland election sinn fein irish americans","story":"The victory for the party that backed the IRA during the Troubles was focused on bread-and-butter issues, not a united IrelandMany Irish Americans supported Sinn Féin when it was the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles, and then during the peace process that helped shepherd the party into the political mainstream. A generation later, did Irish Americans play a role in Sinn Féin’s breakthrough in Ireland’s general election?The election revolved around bread-and-butter topics – the cost of living, insurance premiums, pension reform. Sinn Féin rode a wave of young voters seeking an alternative to the socio-economic status quo represented by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, centrist rivals that have taken turns ruling Ireland for almost a century. For such voters Sinn Féin’s backing of the IRA during the Troubles was a long time ago in a land far away.But stepping back in history, Irish America did hinder, then help, Sinn Féin’s electoral rise. In the 1970s and 80s, Noraid and other US-based republican front groups provided cash and encouragement to a brutal campaign that made Sinn Féin toxic to Irish voters.In the 1990s the so-called four horsemen of Irish American political influence, Edward Kennedy, Tip O’Neill, Daniel Moynihan and Hugh Carey, helped persuade Bill Clinton to back the peace process and grant the then Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams a US visa, paving the way for the 1994 IRA ceasefire and 1998 Good Friday agreement. This marked the start of Sinn Féin’s gradual electoral ascent.Will McDonald be the darling of the St Patrick’s day parade in New York next month?Tricky. She caused a stink last year after marching behind a banner reading “England Get Out Of Ireland”. The Irish government and unionists branded it offensive, isive and an embarrassment. Sinn Féin’s support tumbled and McDonald sort-of-apologised.Should Irish Americans start a countdown to a united Ireland?Premature. Sinn Féin wants a referendum on unity within five years. But in Northern Ireland that decision rests with the British secretary of state, who can call it only if a majority for unification appears likely. That prospect looks remote, notwithstanding Brexit. However, if Sinn Féin ends up in government in Dublin – after weeks, possibly months of coalition talks – it could use a citizens’ assembly, policy papers and other ways to put the dream on the political agenda."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125a1957a172170e7f475a83c4412c274e4512af/0_180_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab31d9a569470d97e7c89ff3aae08183","title":"what coronavirus precautions are you taking","story":"We’d like to hear from readers how they are reacting to reports of new infections in the UKAs the number of people in the UK who got infected with the coronavirus has risen to eight and a second Brighton GP surgery has closed temporarily because of the outbreak, the risks associated with the new virus have become more concrete in Britain.A leading health epidemiologist has claimed that the coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it cannot be controlled, and the British government has declared the virus an “imminent threat”.We would like to hear from  readers in the UK how they are responding to these warnings.

They also believe in the Force – the ubiquitous energy field described in the Star Wars movies – and mindfulness is central to their belief system. “The foundation of who we are is meditation,” says Thompson. “I will meditate for about 30 minutes, but it’s not always the same kind of meditation. So, I don’t sit there all the time and just hum. Meditation comes in many forms and that’s what I try to teach in the community.”To most people, Jedis are the priestly, lightsaber-wielding warriors that existed a long time ago, in a fictional galaxy far, far away. Their creator, the Star Wars writer and director George Lucas, seems to have been heavily influenced by real religions and philosophies such as Buddhism, Taoism, Kabbalah and the medieval code of chivalry. This gives verisimilitude to the Jedi religion in the films. However, the real-world religion arguably has origins in an internet prank almost 20 years ago.Yet among the hundreds of thousands of pranksters were people who truly believed they could feel the Force. Since the census, various attempts have been made to codify Jedi beliefs into a coherent religion, such as the Church of Jediism, founded by 20-year-old Daniel Jones in 2006 in Anglesey, Wales.But with its roots in a film aimed at children, Jediism is wide open for mockery. For instance, followers have to explain that they don’t worship Yoda and, in fact, spend most of their time striving for spiritual growth and self-improvement rather than trying to shoot lightning bolts from their fingertips.Today the UK Jedi community is estimated to have about 2,000 members – similar to the number of Scientologists in the country. However, their sincerity and numbers didn’t sway the Charity Commission, which in 2016 rejected an application for charitable status from the Temple of the Jedi Order, a Jedi organisation started in Beaumont, Texas.This rejection may be just as well, as many Jedis consider Jediism a philosophy rather than a religion, a spiritual operating system on which any religious programme can run. Followers say you can be a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Christian or even an atheist Jedi.Thompson herself had a complicated journey to Jediism. Her early childhood was difficult and she was taken into foster care. After she returned to her mother’s home a year later, she was raised as a Catholic. But she became disillusioned after learning how the church regarded Mary. “It bothered me that this belief system would say you only worship one deity, but they treated Mary like a goddess,” she says. When she was 13, Thompson decided to worship the Sumerian gods Inanna and Enki. Then a close friend introduced her to the Force Academy.There was one sticking point: “I hate Star Wars!” she says. “I felt like it was a Western space opera.” She was convinced only after hearing that the Force Academy aims to make Jediism compatible with other faiths.Today, Thompson credits the spiritual practise with making her more tolerant, contemplative and empathetic. The Jedi, she says, had a “solid plan” on how she could become a “helpful force in the world”. Others say it has even saved their lives. Vishwa Jay, 45, lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is a teacher of Buddhist philosophy, as well as the founder of a Jedi school. His early life was chaotic he was taken into care aged seven and, before turning 18, had lived in five children’s homes and had more than 70 foster placements. This unrelenting displacement meant Jay emerged as an angry young man without meaningful relationships. His anger got him into fights, but he says even this was because he was trying to connect with people. “I got into underground fighting. Suddenly, I had friends for the first time and I didn’t know how to handle it.” Jay was put off the bare-knuckle scene only after an opponent attacked him with an aluminium baseball bat.In his early 20s, Jay got in trouble with the police. He ended up going to see a Hindu swami called Mrs Stone. “I tend to try and be fairly rational about things. I was having a hard time accepting the reality of anything that she was trying to teach me on a spiritual level,” Jay explains. Stone asked him what he held sacred. “Being the rather smart ass that I was, I said Star Wars. She said: ‘Star Wars, hmm, that’s a great place to start.’ Immediately, at that moment, I knew I was doomed,” he says.Jay began by studying the philosophy in the films and meditating. “One of the things that I learned from the Jedi philosophy was that being emotionally stable means facing the darkness within you. One of the foster homes I was living in had farms. And one of the things they do is take cow manure. After a while, it turns into fertiliser. So, the way that I explain it is you have to work through all of your bullshit in order to get something to grow.”Jay, now a father of five, is no longer an angry young man using fists to make friends. He says much of his new happiness is down to Mrs Stone. “I’m pretty sure that I would have ended up in the grave by now because I had no knowledge of myself. I had no real concern about anyone other than myself.”Jay promised his partner, who is not a Jedi, that he would not steer his children to Jediism, although his eldest daughter has found it herself. “She decided that, since it worked for me, it will probably work for her. In the last year she’s started learning a bit about the philosophy.” Does his Jedi Zen help, looking after five kids? “It does. Most people would be completely off their nog just trying to keep up.”Jay Tepley, 38, is a meditation teacher based in London. Before she had even watched the films, people called her a Jedi. “Because of mind mastery. I teach people to make their minds stronger and repel other people’s mental influence. I teach people to become better, stronger versions of themselves,” she says.Is she a real Jedi? “Well, it depends what you mean. I’m not a Jedi in this world’s understanding in terms of people being fans of the films and just dressing up in some peculiar way. I’m more of an actual Jedi from the film. If it were possible for them to travel here, they would recognise me as one of them.” This is not to say she doesn’t wear robes and, as well as teaching meditation, she teaches fencing at her lightsaber club. “Fencing is a great way of training your muscles, your focus and your sense of balance at the same time,” Tepley says.A true Jedi is never without their lightsaber. After all, in Attack of the Clones, Obi Wan Kenobi tells Anakin Skywalker: “This weapon is your life.” Everett Ratcliffe, who goes by the Jedi name Arisaig Winterthorn, concurs. “I use a lightsaber because it’s really, really fun to use and it gets me out there every single day.” Ratcliffe, 26, is from Canada, but lives in Loughborough, Leicestershire. He discovered Jediism after leaving the Canadian army. “When I came to the Jedi path, I was using a cane to walk from an injury acquired in training during my time in the forces. I was fat, I hated myself and my mind was slipping as my life lacked direction. Now, I’m healthy,” Ratcliffe says. After recovering from his injury, Ratcliffe began practising lightsaber flow, a fencing form that entails spinning a sword or staff in intricate spirals. “It’s really intensive on the body and there’s just so much to learn to keep getting better at it.”In the Star Wars films, the Force is the supernatural energy that allows Jedis to levitate objects, confuse Stormtroopers and attack people from a distance. Among followers of Jediism, the Force is interpreted in many ways, but most consider it a metaphor rather than something that helps them choke people like Darth Vader. For Ratcliffe, it is an omnipresent energy field. “I gave myself to the Force and the Force gave me everything,” he says. Can you feel this Force? “Of course. Anyone can. Every time you drink a glass of water you’re feeling the Force. Anything that can be experienced is an experience in the Force.”But he says: “You ask 10 Jedi, you’ll get 10 different answers.” He is not wrong: for Tepley, the Force is the energy that underlines our entire existence Thompson thinks it accounts for miracles Jay believes it might have been responsible for the big bang. Richard Sroka, a programme analyst from Portland, Oregon, says the Force feels like a wellspring. “It feels like being a lot more alive, a lot more energetic,” he says. “You’re not worrying about tomorrow, you’re not worrying about yesterday. You’re living precisely when you are.”Like Jay, Sroka struggled with anger, and the nostalgia he had for the films drew him to Jediism. “It’s the first thing that clicked,” he says. After immersing himself in Jedi philosophy, Sroka felt better able to control his temper. “When I start to feel angry, I take a step back, view where it’s coming from, identify what’s causing it and find the solutions to it. That’s where a lot of my connection to Jediism begins. It also taught me that sometimes you’ve got to disengage you’re not always going to be able to get through the situation.”Should we be mocking this belief system that sprung from our local multiplexes? Speaking to Jedi followers, it becomes clear that the lessons Jediism teaches are things that can be learned at Sunday school: help others, help yourself, embrace the light and resist the dark. In other words, be righteous and resist temptation. Sroka is philosophical about the fact most people won’t take it seriously. “It came from a movie and people don’t quite get it and that’s fine,” he says. Yet, he points out, that doesn’t mean it cannot help people. “When I go to work out, I have the mental image of Kratos from God of War,” he says referring to a popular video game. “Am I going to be able to hold two axes and do all those crazy stunts? Am I going to have those giant muscles? No. Am I going to have a great beard? Probably not, but if that’s what gets me up and moving then why is that a bad thing?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd47aab20a01be4cdd5cacb0302350df8de3c361/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bed6bd9363dde58a1f3cbbc7d20687c9","title":"how novel coronavirus spread across the world visual explainer","story":"Confirmed cases of flu-like virus  29 countries, with about 1,000 deaths mostly in mainland ChinaThe coronavirus epidemic began in Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people and the capital of the Hubei province in China.

It said the photographs were processed to produce a template that allows comparison with other images to detect cases of identity theft or double claiming of benefits.The previous version of the privacy statement contained no reference to biometric processing.Carrying out biometric processing is controversial among civil liberties and data-protection advocates.Fred Logue, a solicitor and data-protection expert, said it was debatable whether the benefit of a minimal reduction in welfare fraud was strong enough to outweigh the risks and intrusion on fundamental rights associated with the creation of a national biometric facial recognition database.“The creation of a national database of facial recognition images, for which there’s no specific legislation and no safeguards in law, is very risky and could well be illegal,” he said. “You have to balance that against the financial benefit, and you have to question whether it’s proportional.”Suspected fraudFacial matching technology has been used to detect 220 cases of suspected fraud since 2013, leading to savings of €4.74 million, according to information provided to the Oireachtas last year.The extent to which biometric data is captured and processed as part of the PSC programme has proved to be a contentious part of the long-running debate on the card. Previously, outgoing Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty said the department did not hold biometric data.“We’re not holding biometric data. And I can categorically say that that’s true, because the only thing we hold is your photograph,” she said in a Newstalk interview in 2017. In a tweet the same year, Ms Doherty said: “We do not collect biometric data.”The department insisted last night that its position on the biometric processing of data had not changed.“The department has always been clear that, as part of the Safe Registration process, a standard photograph is taken and is used for two purposes. First, for use as a visual identity on the public service card – this photograph is not biometric. Second, as part of a separate process, a biometric template is produced from the photograph for the department’s own internal use.”The department also confirmed that it was changing its privacy statement in several ways due to “deficiencies” identified by the Data Protection Commissioner during its investigation into the PSC, which was completed last year. However, the department is taking a legal challenge against the findings of that investigation. It would not comment on whether this challenge was affected by its decision to implement the changes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4170208.1581417526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"flying in storm ciara four landing attempts vomiting passengers diversion to germany","story":"Eyewitness footage from around Europe shows pilots struggling to take off and land as Storm Ciara - known as Storm Sabine in Germany - makes its presence felt around Europe.

As I sat at the gate I received a text saying my flight was cancelled, so was delighted when staff moved me onto a 10.50am flight. Others around me faced a wait until 5pm.That joy soon evaporated. We boarded at 10.30am. The woman beside me was visiting her pregnant daughter and joked they would have to call the baby Ciara.As the plane wobbled alarmingly in the strong winds on the ground, the captain said we could not leave for an hour.It looked wild outside, but I saw other planes taking off and was not too worried.When we finally took off the plane shuddered and shook, sending my adrenaline soaring and prompting expressions of concern among other passengers.An hour later, when we descended towards Gatwick, the plane jumped and shook.We swooped down and back up violently while attempting to land four times.People were shouting and breathing deeply into their sick bags. I gripped the armrests as tightly as I could, terrified. Others were getting sick – or crying.After repeated attempts to land, lasting around one hour, the plane climbed above the clouds.The captain said because we were unable to land safely at Gatwick we needed to go to Luxembourg to refuel.We’d been in the sky for almost three hours.There was a rush to the toilets despite the seatbelt signs being on, and many people ran up the aisles cupping full sick bags. The air stewards – upbeat, kind and calm – asked passengers to remain seated.That wasn’t going to happen . . .The captain then said Luxembourg airport was full and that we had to fly to Frankfurt.Everyone laughed initially at the catalogue of mishaps, but the mood quickly changed to concern that we could run out of fuel, especially if there were problems during landing.Eventually we landed at 3pm in Frankfurt Hahn, and people started phoning relatives to say we had arrived very late, somewhere very far away from Gatwick after a four-hour flight.Some tried to recount the events of the flights others sought to downplay what happened.We remained on the plane.The stewards tried to serve refreshments, but the aisles were full of restless, hungry people, exhausted from adrenaline and seeking answers.Some people refused to stay on the plane and insisted on getting off even though they would have to find and fund their way back.There are no direct Dublin flights from Frankfurt Hahn.Eventually we were told “the powers that be” wanted the plane back in Dublin, and that Gatwick was accepting very few flights.Despite the frustration, the camaraderie among passengers was great: one man joked his daughter was delighted she would miss school the next day.Someone handed out bags from a souvenir multi-pack of Tayto. We giggled from nerves.At 5.30pm, the captain confirmed we were returning to Dublin and the tirelessly helpful stewards prepared for takeoff for the two-hour flight.As we descended into Dublin, dipping lower and lower, the plane suddenly whooshed up again and people started laughing and screaming. Were we ever going to be on the ground again?The captain said it was too windy to land on this approach so we were going to try again.My neighbours had their head in hands as I reassured them we were wobbling closer and closer to the ground.Finally we landed, at 8.30pm.

She said she has “always been open to serving in government” but that it must address the need to build public housing on public land.She said she would “certainly” serve in a government with Sinn Féin if the numbers were there.She said that the next government must not “pay lip service” to climate change and must take significant action.\u0027Open to all offers\u0027Galway East Independent TD Seán Canney also said he is “willing to play a part in government, I would be available and would talk to all parties if they want to talk to me”.He said he will insist that the National Broadband Plan is fully rolled out as a red line.Donegal Independent TD Thomas Pringle said he would serve in a government of the left, but would not play a role in any government which involves Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.Peadar Tóibín, Aontú leader and Meath West TD, also said that he had contacted about five Independents in a bid to find a “common platform” to negotiate a place in a coalition.Peter Fitzpatrick, who was re-elected as an Independent TD in Louth after resigning from Fine Gael in 2018, said that he was “open to all offers” and that he was “a listening person.”“I will do what I can to do what is best for my constituency,” he said.Mr Fitzpatrick said that he hoped that a government was formed that would create “a bit of stability with Brexit coming down the road and everything else - there is a lot of uncertainty.”\u0027Runaway rents\u0027On Tuesday evening, Mr Doherty suggested that Fianna Fáil “have shifted their position and are now open to discussing with Sinn Féin and they have realised this election has changed everything.”“Our first job of work is to reach out to those parties who have recieved a mandate for change... but we’ve made it clear we will be discussing with all political parties,” he said outside the Sinn Féin headquarters in Dublin.“It’s about reflecting the views of the public the public have said very clearly, to the entire political system that they want change from the broken systems of the past, the Fine Gael domination, and Fianna Fáil.”He said the party had no red lines on ministries it had targeted, and had not decided its position on drawing full salaries. “The position from Sinn Féin is we would like to see TDs, Senators and Ministers’ salaries cut.”He recommitted to the party’s promises on rent, saying “not only do we need a rent freeze but we need a rent reduction.”“That’s very much on the agenda, that’s very much part of our core message to stop runaway rents happening in this capital and right across the state. Not just having a freeze, but making sure there is a reduction on those rents.”He said a deadline on talks is “not in our gift” but that there should be no delay on government formation. “We need to inject urgency on this.”Mr Doherty will lead negotiations alongside the party’s health and housing spokespersons Louise O’Reilly and Eoin Ó\u0026nbspBroin, and newly elected Cavan-Monaghan TD Matt Carthy.In an unprecedented election result, Fianna Fáil has secured 38 seats, just one ahead of Sinn Féin on 37 and three ahead of Fine Gael on 35.The Green Party has increased its seats from three to 12 and the Social Democrats have tripled their seat count from two to six.Solidarity-People Before Profit has five seats – partially thanks to sizeable transfers from Sinn Féin – while the Labour Party is returning to the next Dáil with six. Aontú has retained its one seat and there are 19 Independents.The Dáil is scheduled to reconvene on Thursday, February 20th, but before then talks to form a government will intensify.Uncertain outlookThe prospect of a Sinn Féin-led leftist government looks uncertain despite claims from leader Mary Lou McDonald that she could yet be taoiseach.A majority of 80 seats is needed to form a government.Left-wing TD Richard Boyd Barrett on Tuesday played down the prospect of such a government.“If you look at the numbers . . . it appears we don’t quite have the numbers,” he told Newstalk.“We will explore what we can do in that regard, but looking at the raw numbers, it would seem we are short of a majority to be able to do that.”Mr Boyd Barrett said he believed there would be discussions between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil about a possible coalition and also between Fianna Fail, Sinn Féin and the Greens.Ms McDonald has said her first preference would be to form a coalition involving neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael.The Sinn Féin leader indicated she will hold talks with Solidarity-People Before Profit, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour as well as Independents.Ahern commentsFormer taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern suggested there was a possibility of Sinn Féin forming a left coalition with like-minded Independents.“I can’t see that being a success, but it could be,” he said.“There is a sizeable number of rural Independents, probably a group of at least 10 who are like-minded enough, who got strong votes.”Mr Ahern told Newstalk that over the last 30 years “new things come up” out of “Dáil and election chaos”.On the possibility of a Fianna FáilSinn Féin coalition, Mr Ahern said he didn’t think there would be a “a sizeable number of Fianna Fáil people” who would have an appetite for it.Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy said the “numbers are going to be tight” in the party’s efforts to forge an administration without Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil but said “we have an obligation” to talk to the left-wing parties first over the coming days.Fine Gael’s outgoing Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said the “onus is on Mary Lou” to try and form a government.Rotating taoiseachDespite her stated preference, Ms McDonald has said that “of course” she intended to talk to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about the possibility of government formation. Both parties had previously ruled out working with Sinn Féin after the election.She said that the question of a rotating taoiseach would be “part and parcel” of any negotiations with the other big parties.Fianna Fáil is deeply ided over whether it should seek a coalition with Fine Gael or with Sinn Féin.A view has taken hold among party TDs that it should enter opposition and allow Sinn Féin to attempt to form a minority government.Senior Fine Gael sources reiterated the view that they would not consider entering government with Sinn Féin, with some senior figures favouring a spell in opposition for the party after nine years in government.Some party sources said a coalition with Fianna Fáil could come on to the agenda after some weeks if no other government was formed.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Many defeated TDs are expected to seek nominations to run for the Seanad in an attempt to save their political careers.As the political casualties stretch across the electoral battlefield, among them 15 former Fianna Fáil and 12 former Fine Gael TDs, the parties are to decide over coming days who they should prioritise and nominate to run for a seat in the Upper House in next month’s election.Should they wish to continue in public life, Fine Gael is expected to nominate a number of high-profile former TDs including Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty, chief whip Seán Kyne, Minister of State Michael D’Arcy as well as Kate O’Connell, Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy and Tom Neville.Unsuccessful Fianna Fáil candidates Lisa Chambers and Fiona O’Loughlin, whose shock defeats stunned the party, are likely to be priority candidates for nomination to the Seanad.Catherine Ardagh, who had been expected to win a Dáil seat in Dublin South-Central, is likely to be offered a chance to return to the Seanad and other incumbent Senators are also expected to be selected again.Twenty-three Senators ran in the general election and seven were successful including Fine Gael’s Kieran O’Donnell, Colm Burke and Neale Richmond Fianna Fail’s Jennifer Murnane O’Connor Ged Nash and Aodhán Ó Riordáin of Labour and Sinn Féin’s Pádraig Mac Lochlainn.Fianna Fáil former TD Eugene Murphy from Galway-Roscommon has also confirmed he is hoping to get a nomination following his defeat in the three-seater rural constituency, which no longer has any Fianna Fáil TDs.Labour is to decide this weekend at a meeting of its central council on about four nominees and is expected to focus on young candidatesIt will be some days before final decisions are made and other candidates are likely to be considered or to put themselves forward.One Seanad observer suggested there “could be blood on the floor” in the rush to get nominations.Electoral systemUnder the complicated Seanad electoral system, a total of about 1,200 politicians – local councillors, outgoing Senators and incoming TDs – vote in 43 of the 60 seats in the Upper House, often seen as the practice ground for those aspiring to hold a Dáil seat in the future and those who failed to retain theirs.The taoiseach of the day nominates a further 11 and six senators are elected by graduates from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College.Candidates for the 43 seats can go through an “inside” route where they must get their nomination signed by four members of the Oireachtas who are only allowed to sign one such paper. This allows a maximum of 55 candidates across all parties. Under the “outside” route anyone can apply to a so-called nominating body for a nomination.There are currently 111 nominating bodies – generally civil society bodies across agriculture, business, arts, culture, industrial and union groupings – which apply for the right to nominate candidates.Three outgoing Senators – Fianna Fáil’s Denis O’Donovan, Independent Victor Boyhan and Independent Brian Ó Dómhnaill – have already secured their nominations which must by law be displayed on notice boards hanging outside Leinster House for the duration of the nomination process.Nominations for outside bodies close on February 24th while nominations for inside panels close a week later on March 2nd.It is a postal ballot process which runs from March 16th until the deadline of 11am on March 30th.

Photograph: Tom HonanSinn Féin’s attempts to pull together a government that excludes Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have begun to stutter, with smaller parties expressing scepticism such a coalition can be put together.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald would need to bring most of the 20 Independents in the new Dáil into government, as well as the Green Party, People Before Profit-Solidarity, Labour and the Social Democrats, to command a majority.Several Independents have indicated a willingness to serve in government provided their demands are met.It comes as Micheál Martin began to make contact with the leaders of the smaller parties yesterday, and a Fianna Fáil-led minority administration underpinned from Opposition by Fine Gael is not being ruled out by senior Fianna Fáil figures.Mr Martin would have the numbers in the Dáil if he won the support of the Greens, Labour, Social Democrats and some Independents and got Leo Varadkar to commit to a confidence-and-supply arrangement.But Labour leader Brendan Howlin is expected to tell his parliamentary party today that his party, which won six seats, did not achieve enough critical mass in the election to enable it to enter government. Sources said Mr Howlin would leave open the prospect of Labour supporting a government from opposition on a number of key policy areas, such as housing.SF negotiating teamSinn Féin yesterday appointed a negotiating team, to be led by finance spokesman Pearse Doherty, which will seek to begin meetings with smaller parties and Independents on Wednesday.Solidarity-People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd-Barrett said he did not believe there would be sufficient TDs for an alternative coalition of progressive parties led by Sinn Féin.Social Democrats joint leader Róisín Shortall also said it appeared that the “numbers aren’t there” to construct a government without Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.The Green Party met on Tuesday morning and agreed to talk to all other parties.

He also wanted to see a rural resettlement programme and said he would “not support any crowd” that had a role in a potential downgrading of Bantry Hospital.Sources in both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael say they will stay out of the way and let Sinn Féin try – and fail, most expect – to put together a coalition.Few TDs expect that the Dáil will elect a taoiseach when it meets on February 20th.If Leo Varadkar is not elected taoiseach, he will resign his post, but he and his Ministers will continue in office as a caretaker Government until the Dáil approves their successors.

Photograph: David AbelFacebookPA WireChina’s coronavirus outbreak poses a “very grave threat for the rest of the world” and should be viewed as “public enemy number one”, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to step up measures to detect and contain the virus, especially in at least 30 countries with weaker health systems, where it could “create havoc”.The virus has been named Covid-19, for coronavirus disease 2019, with no geographical association, he said.Mr Tedros, referring to some governments’ counter-terrorism measures, said: “To be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack.“A virus can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action. If the world doesn’t want to wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one, I don’t think we will learn from our lessons,” he said.China has reported 42,708 confirmed confirmed cases, including 1,017 deaths, Mr Tedros said, noting that there were fewer than 400 cases in 24 other countries with one death.The WHO began a two-day meeting in Geneva, where it appealed for sharing virus samples and speeding up research into drugs and vaccines.“The first vaccine could be ready in 18 months. So we have to do everything today using the available weapons to fight this virus while preparing for the long term using the preparations for the vaccines,” Mr Tedros said.“With 99 per cent of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,” he told more than 400 researchers and national authorities, including some taking part by video conference from mainland China and Taiwan. Hong KongMr Tedros, speaking to reporters on Monday, had referred to “some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China”, citing cases this week in France and Britain. Five British nationals were diagnosed with the coronavirus in France, after staying in the same ski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore. “The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now it’s only a spark. Our objective remains containment,” he said.Hong Kong residents evacuated from a residential building where a man and woman confirmed with coronavirus live tested negative for the virus, health authorities said on Tuesday, easing concerns of a cluster of the outbreak in the Chinese-ruled city.Many questions remain about the origin of the virus, which emerged at a wildlife market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, and is spread by people in droplets from coughing or sneezing.“We hope that one of the outcomes of this meeting will be an agreed roadmap for research around which researchers and donors will align,” Mr Tedros told the meeting. China’s foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, said numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month. “I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” said Mr Zhong (83), an epidemiologist who won fame for his role in combating an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003.Off Japan’s port of Yokohama, the Diamond Princess cruise ship with 3,700 passengers and crew remained quarantined, with the number of confirmed cases at 135.

Photograph: Jean-Francois BadiasAPBoris Johnson’s suggestion that the UK could be prepared to accept an Australian-style relationship with the EU without a formal trade deal has “surprised” Brussels. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen pointed out that even Australia wants a better trading relationship with the bloc than the one it currently has.She said the UK and EU should be “way more ambitious” about reaching a full trade deal.In a speech setting out the UK’s negotiating objectives, the British prime minister said the question was whether to seek a Canadian-style deal or an Australian-style relationship, “and I have no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper”.But speaking in the European Parliament, Ms von der Leyen said both models fell short of a deal which would meet the goals of allowing trade without tariffs and quotas.That aim, set out in the political declaration, would require a “level playing field” with both sides guaranteeing “fair competition and the protection of social, environmental and consumer standards”.“We are ready to discuss all different models of trade agreement. But all these models, whatever you choose, have one thing in common — they all come not only with rights but also with obligations for both sides.”The Canada deal eliminates most, but not all, tariffs and quotas and “we still have our standards that have to be respected”, she said.Ms von der Leyen added: “Honestly, I was a little bit surprised to hear the prime minister of the United Kingdom speak about the Australian model.“Australia, without any doubt, is a strong and a like-minded partner. But the European Union does not have a trade agreement with Australia.“We are currently trading on WTO terms and, if this is the British choice, well, we are fine with that, without any question.”But the EU was trying to negotiate a trade deal with Australia to end the current situation.“Of course the UK can decide to settle for less, but I personally believe that we should be way more ambitious,” she said.Javid plansMs von der Leyen’s speech in Strasbourg came as the UK government set out further details of its plans for January 1st, 2021 after the Brexit transition period expires.Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government will aim to conclude a full range of equivalence assessments by June 2020 – allowing the UK and EU to respect each other’s rules.But he said the UK would also have the freedom to erge and regulate in a different way from the rules set in Brussels.Writing in City AM, he said: “Each side will only grant equivalence if it believes the other’s regulations are compatible.“But compatible does not mean identical, and both the UK and the EU have at different times recognised the importance of focusing on regulatory outcomes.“We will no longer be rule-takers, but we remain committed to the highest international standards of financial regulation and to shaping global rule-making.”But Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: “I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear to certain people in the United Kingdom bearing authority that they should not kid themselves about this – there will not be general, open-ended, ongoing equivalence in financial services.”The EU would “retain a free hand to take our own decisions”.Senior cabinet minister Michael Gove confirmed on Monday that goods coming to Britain from the EU will face import controls from January 1st.The British Retail Consortium said the government would have to move fast to get infrastructure in place for the start of 2021, warning that without adequate preparations the availability of goods on shelves would be disrupted, with fresh fruit and vegetables especially vulnerable.Mr Barnier told MEPs it would not be “business as usual” after January 1st.“Come what may, on January 1st we will be imposing checks on all products entering the single market, just as we do to every other third country in the world,” he said. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.New Hampshire Primary 2020: Bernie Sanders leads in early results with all polls now closed - live updates Coronavirus latest news: Japan cruise ship has 39 new cases, including quarantine officerDavid Hockney\u0026#39s The Splash sells at Sotheby\u0026#39s for more than £23 millionMichel Barnier tells Sajid Javid not to \u0026#39kid\u0026#39 himself over long-term financial services deal with EUArmy hits recruitment target for first time in six years Britain\u0026#39s economy will be hardest hit in Europe by climate change, study finds Row erupts at General Synod over LGBT rights in the churchSocial media sites could be blocked from UK, as Ofcom gets job of  policing duty of care lawsCabinet reshuffle: Remainers back in favour, but Boris Johnson steers clear of top table \u0026#39revolution\u0026#39Coronavirus threat spreads to British schools and prisons Teenager who came into contact with coronavirus superspreader targeted with abuse BBC Chairman says scrapping licence fee would \u0026#39weaken the nation\u0026#39London-based security expert faces fresh call from US to give evidence to Russian election interference probeComment: With HS2, Boris has rediscovered the can-do spirit of the VictoriansComment: HS2 and quicker, local projects will transform the way people travelThe carnage in Syria\u0026#39s Idlib should not come as a surprise to anyoneRussian bride and groom face jail over wedding pictures featuring spyCoronavirus threat reaches schools as UK warned crisis \u0026#39will get worse before it gets better\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brighton known party atmosphere untilcoronavirus washed foreign","story":"Since 1981 Brighton barber Tony Wheeler has welcomed customers with open arms. But with the city declared the epicentre of Britain’s coronavirus outbreak he has in recent days been keeping his hands firmly to himself.“I have to admit I am worried about it,” says Wheeler, who yesterday was steering clear of shaking hands and leaving the haircuts to his younger members of staff despite his nickname ‘Lucky Tone’ proudly embossed on the shop mirror. “My problem is I always catch everything.” Not, he adds, that there have been many customers to even shake hands with at his barber shop on London Road. “It is killing business. People are very scared about everything and they don’t want to come out.”Brighton is normally better known for its party atmosphere and invigorating sea air, but that was before coronavirus washed up from foreign shores.Now residents are instead reaching for surgical masks and avoiding bodily contact as five of the eight confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK are in the city.For an indication of how seriously some are taking the outbreak, a few hundred yards up the road from Wheeler’s barbers, Chinese supermarket Yun Feng Oriental Food Store yesterday had a sign displayed in the window saying it was closed for deliveries and would only accept customers wearing masks and disposable gloves – which were being made available in store.Over the road Yagmur Mete, the 22-year-old manager of an organic fruit and veg shop, was rather more relaxed, although admitted a new staff member recently arrived from Turkey had grown so concerned about the outbreak that he had just rushed into the city centre to buy himself a mask. “I told him we have always had outbreaks,” she says. “A couple of years ago it was the same with swine flu and everyone panicked then.”Some here are still treating the outbreak with similar sangfroid. In primary school playgrounds yesterday children had even invented a new game: coronavirus tag. But along the waymarks visited by the Hove scout leader and coronavirus “super spreader” Steve Walsh, a rising sense of anxiety is gripping the city.The 53-year-old Walsh called in at the pub for a drink on Saturday February 1 after picking up the disease at a Singapore conference at the end of last month and returning to Hove via a skiing holiday in the Alps. Five staff members at the pub who might have come into contact with Walsh have since been instructed to self-isolate” though yesterday afternoon a gaggle of hardened drinkers were still propping up the bar.A far more popular destination seemed the pharmacy over the road where staff said they had sold out of hand sanitiser gel and face masks. Demand is running so high that according to the pharmacy even the main warehouse in Croydon which supplies the protective masks has run out.Prior to being quarantined at an isolation unit at London\u0027s St Guy’s Hospital, Walsh also attended a yoga class at the Cornerstone Community Centre in Hove. The centre has since closed for the week with manager Jonathan Burrell (who attended the class) in self-isolation awaiting his fate.His colleague, Paul O’Connell, says he is yet to report any symptoms although will remain in isolation until next week. “On Monday morning we had a couple of children’s groups at the centre and all the parents came to take their kids out,” he says. “People have been worried and there has been a bit of panic around.”Outside the community centre, local resident Angi Drew was surveying the noticeboard for upcoming activities. But the 64-year-old admits even after it opens she will give the centre a wide berth for a while. Drew will also be avoiding the communion cup if it is passed around her church this Sunday (during the 2009 swine flu outbreak church leaders withheld the communion cup). “I imagine I am going to be very cautious,” she says.The outbreak has led to some unpleasant reports of discrimination against the city’s large Chinese community, many of whom are students.Near Brighton station 22-year-old Sussex University media student Olivia Loi was recording a film with fellow Chinese classmates - some of whom were wearing masks. She said two friends from the Philippines had in recent days had eggs thrown at them for wearing masks in Brighton.“I feel there is discrimination towards Asian people if they are wearing masks but it is just common sense,” she says.Loi, who comes from the Chinese city of Macau, also has a word of warning for those still not taking the arrival of coronavirus in Britain seriously enough.“Most people in the UK don’t know how dangerous it is,” she says. “But people should be as worried about the virus as we are because it spreads really fast.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus super spreaders links schools sparks panic brighton","story":"The coronavirus threat has spread to schools and prisons, with warnings from the Health Secretary that the crisis facing Britain “will get worse before it gets better”.Matt Hancock on Tuesday announced plans for hospitals to build emergency isolation facilities, saying the Government would take all necessary precautions to keep the public safe.Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, said everyone “should be confident and calm” about Britain’s response to the virus. Four schools in Brighton were on Tuesday allowing children to stay home, or had pupils in “self-isolation” amid growing panic across the city. Four GP surgeries and a nursing home have closed as a result of links with coronavirus, with two GPs among those diagnosed in recent days.On Tuesday Steve Walsh, a Hove businessman, was identified as the man who had inadvertently passed on the virus to 11 Britons, including five Brighton residents.The father-of-two had joined friends skiing in France on his way back to the UK from a conference in Singapore.Two prisoners in HMP Bullingdon, Oxfordshire, were being tested for coronavirus on Tuesday after coming down with flu-like symptoms. One had recently been transferred from a Thai prison. Both are being kept in isolation in their cells, with restrictions placed on access to the prison wing as they await test results.Meanwhile, senior GPs claimed that NHS 111 had directed patients with flu-like symptoms to consult their GP, without checking if they had travelled from regions worst-affected by coronavirus.Those at risk of the virus are supposed to be sent to take tests in NHS isolation pods.But NHS England insisted that the protocols given to advisers ensured those from China and other countries most at risk were being directed to get help without putting other patients at risk.On Tuesday the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged countries to be “as aggressive as possible” at containing the virus, warning that it should never have been allowed to get beyond China.Director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the virus was “public enemy number one,” and said every country must use every weapon in its armoury to control the virus.Health chiefs warned that it could be 18 months before a vaccine is available.On Tuesday Mr Hancock told the Commons: “The situation will get worse before it gets better. We will be guided by the science. Be in no doubt, we will do everything that is effective to tackle this virus and keep people safe.”“Today I can announce to the House the immediate launch of a capital facility to support any urgent works the NHS needs for the coronavirus response, such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities.”Mr Hancock added that efforts to trace anyone who had been in contact with the first four UK coronavirus cases were “complete”, while work relating to the latter four, all of which were infected by Mr Walsh, was “ongoing”.On Tuesday the WHO announced a name for the virus - Covid-19.Its director general told a press conference a name was decided that “did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an inidual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease”.Earlier, Professor Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director of Public Health England (PHE), said “contact tracing” run by PHE was “working very well”.He added: “I should say that the people who are of concern are those who have had very close contact with somebody with coronavirus, face-to-face contact or within a two-metre range for 15 minutes or more.”A total of 13 British people are now confirmed to have the virus - all but one linked to Mr Walsh - while a further two Chinese citizens, one of whom was a student at the University of York, are being treated in Newcastle.An NHS spokesman said: “NHS 111 does not advise patients with concerns about coronavirus to visit their GP.” More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000224289211_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFQfAtbbiWQ9LTv4s2yIts_GH8TDIoV-pDol7ykUJZu8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"new hampshire primary 2020 live results latest democratic vote","story":"Pete Buttigieg won the first vote of the primaries, claiming the Iowa caucus. Can he maintain momentum and win New Hampshire?Tuesday night is the second Democrat contest, in New HampshireAll polls now closed as results start to dropBernie Sanders is currently favourite to winColorado senator Michael Bennet suspends his campaignJoe Biden, fourth in Iowa, hits out at winner Pete Buttigieg Bernie Sanders is leading the New Hampshire primary with the first results dropping. The progressive senator from Vermont appears to be around six per cent ahead of his nearest rival, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg.Moderate candidate Amy Klobuchar is currently in third place, with around a fifth of the votes counted. It appears to be a very bad night for Joe Biden, the former US vice president, who is currently in fifth place. Meanwhile tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who campaigned on giving every adult American $1,000 a month, suspended his campaign for president Tuesday after failing to make an impact in the New Hampshire primary.Our signature proposal, universal basic income, has become part of the mainstream conversation, Mr Yang told cheering supporters as he bowed out.Expert insight and exclusive analysis on the 2020 election, written by our US team.New Hampshire is the second contest of the US presidential nominating cycle, and while few votes are on offer, it gives candidates a chance to build momentum for their campaigns in a crowded field.Bernie might be heading for victory tonight but that does not mean all his supporters think he is home a dry, Ben Riley-Smith writes. Daniel Perea-Kane, a 25-year-old teacher who has been knocking doors for the Sanders campaign in the state, has worries about what comes next. He believes Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg are not out of the race yet, seeing them as the key moderates to beat. But that is not his real fear. I\u0027m more concerned with the party, he tells The . I think they\u0027ll take any measure they can to stop him taking the leadership.If it seems like Bernie is winning a lot they might try to create enough opposition to give it to someone else at the convention. Others are more optimistic. Ian Root, a 38-year-old software engineer and campaign volunteer, thinks his candidate can defeat Donald Trump. I think when people have Bernie and Trump on stage the authenticity Bernie brings will ring true and also the policy knowledge, Ian says. He dismisses the idea that the only way to win back supporters who went for the US president in 2016 is with a centrist. I think it\u0027s nonsense, he says. People talk about moderates as though it is people with opinions all down the middle.If you can find the right unifying issue then you can pull them to you, even if that policy is quite extreme. Joe Biden\u0027s surrogates are doing their best to mask a disappointing night for the absent candidate at his campaign\u0027s New Hampshire watch party.Mr Biden originally planned to attend, but his campaign announced on Tuesday that that he would instead hold an event in South Carolina.That left former New Hampshire Governor John Lynch and Mr Biden\u0027s sister, Valerie Biden Owens, to take his place.Ms Biden Owens said this was the very beginning of a long marathon to the nomination. And we\u0027re ready to go the distance.While the results don\u0027t seem to be what we hoped, we\u0027re going to take our campaign to every corner of this country, she said.Appearing to the audience via live stream, Mr Biden vowed to return to defeat Mr Trump in November\u0027s general election.I do love New Hampshire, Mr Biden said. And I mean it.Mr Steyer\u0027s press secretary has insisted the candidate is just getting started amid reports the billionaire was about to end his campaign. Just as we saw in Iowa last week, tonight’s results from New Hampshire show that the race for the Democratic nomination is wide open. Until Nevada and South Carolina have the chance to vote, we won’t know which candidates can build the erse and unified coalition we need to win in November.Mr Steyer has currently got just 3.6 per cent in New Hampshire, but he has set his sights on South Carolina and Nevada where he has spending huge sums on advertising. South Carolina, the fourth state to vote, will offer the first indication of how candidates fare with African American voters. Mr Biden has hitched his campaign\u0027s success to winning the state, but Mr Steyer is closing in on him in the polls.Progressive candidate Mr Sanders has maintained his lead in the primary with almost half of the votes counted, with a four point margin over moderate Mr Buttigieg, who has received 23.4 per cent of the vote share. Another moderate, Ms Klobuchar, has had a strong night with almost 20 per cent of the vote share. It is a poor night for Ms Warren, who represents neighbouring Massachusetts in the US senate. She is currently on just 9.5 per cent - ahead of Mr Biden who is currently in fifth place with 8.6 per cent. The New Hampshire primary has claimed a second scalp with Michael Bennet announcing he is dropping out of the race tonight. The Colorado senator was a late entrant to the race and had staked his bid largely on trying to win New Hampshire.  Once tipped to be a rising star by Barack Obama, Mr Bennet ran on a centrist platform but ultimately struggled to break out of the crowded field. The 55-year-old told supporters shortly after polls closed in New Hampshire that it was fitting to end his presidential effort in the state, where he had actively campaigned.Elizabeth Warren is addressing supporters with early results showing her in fourth place in New Hampshire. Despite the poor performance, the Massachusetts senator insists her campaign is in it for the long haul. We are just getting started, she says. Ms Warren conceded that Mr Sanders and Mr Buttigieg had strong nights. But she added: I also want to congratulate my friend and colleague Amy Klobuchar for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out. Ms Warren has previously claimed Mr Sanders told her a woman could not win the White House.The senator also warned that Democrats have to be honest with themselves, saying: we might be headed for another one of those long primary fights that lasts for months.Framing herself as the unity candidate, Ms Warren said: The fight between factions in our party has taken a sharp turn in recent weeks, with ads mocking other candidates and with supporters of some candidates shouting curses  about other Democratic candidates. But if we’re going to beat Donald Trump in November, we are going to need huge turnout within our party, and to get that turnout, we will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels they can get behind.In case you missed the Andrew Yang phenomenon here is Nick Allen\u0027s interview with him in September.  Mr Yang explained how he wanted to give $1,000 a month to every American adult, much of it funded by taxing large businesses like Amazon, Google and Facebook.  I\u0027m peeling off Trump supporters,” Mr Yang told The  . “There were many people who voted for Donald Trump because they believed his solutions, but his solutions were garbage and nonsense.Our signature proposal, universal basic income, has become part of the mainstream conversation, Mr Yang told cheering supporters as he bowed out tonight.The 45-year-old was polling at a lowly three per cent with 20 percent of polling stations reporting, placing him well out of contention.Without a doubt, we accelerated the eradication of poverty in our society by years, even generations, Mr Yang added.Ben Riley-Smith, our US editor, has this: Hello from what is effectively Bernie HQ tonight - a vast sports hall in Manchester, New Hampshire.  It is still only just filling up but those already sitting on the bleachers are expecting a mighty night. Whoops, cheering and chants of Bernie! Bernie! rung out as the clock turned just past 8pm, the moment all the state\u0027s polls closed. We still have a long night ahead, but the lead Mr Sanders has on his nearest rival, Pete Buttigieg, is substantial.  A double first for Bernie - tied top in Iowa and then winning here - would mean he is most likely to take the Demcratic nomination.  Imagine a Trump-Bernie battle? The electoral map scrambled, two fired-up septuagenarians going toe-to-toe. Is that where we\u0027re heading?All polls are now closed in the Granite State. Around 14 per cent of the votes are now in and we\u0027ll be bringing you the remaining results as they arrive.We are hearing that Andrew Yang, the maverick outside candidate who surprised everyone to make the national debate stage, is planning to suspend his campaign tonight. Sources say that the disappointing early results in New Hampshire are behind the decision. If the reports are true, Mr Yang\u0027s departure will further diminish the ersity of the candidate field.The Republican primary is also being held in the Granite State today, but since Mr Trump does not have any serious competition it has gone largely unreported. However Mr Trump, who was campaigning in New Hampshire on Monday night, has sought to inject chaos in the process.The Republican president suggested that conservative-leaning voters could affect the state\u0027s Democratic primary results, saying: I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats.My only problem is I\u0027m trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate. I think they\u0027re all weak, he added.There is one problem with this tactic: it is only registered Democrats and independent voters who can participate in New Hampshire\u0027s Democratic presidential primary.We have an early estimate from voting wards in Concord and Dover, New Hampshire, which show Bernie Sanders ahead. Pete Buttigieg is in second place. Here is CNN\u0027s estimates at this early stage:The first polls have closed in New Hampshire. Early exit polls show the majority of voters were undecided until very recently. By the night\u0027s end, New Hampshire could begin culling the crowded Democratic field, which still features nearly a dozen candidates battling for the chance to take on Donald Trump in November.This ballot box dates back to 1888Roughly 6 in 10 people said they prioritise a candidate who can beat Donald Trump over one who agrees with them on the issues, an exit poll found. Just over 1 in 10 voters said they were very confident that their party\u0027s process for choosing a presidential nominee was fair, according to a wide-ranging AP VoteCast survey. At the same time, nearly 8 in 10 also viewed the economy as unfair, although there was little consensus on which candidate would do the best job of stewarding the world\u0027s largest economy. Most polls close at 7pm but a few remain open until 8pmMr Biden will be absent from his campaign\u0027s results night party in New Hampshire tonight. The former vice president will instead be in South Carolina, the state he has staked his campaign\u0027s survival on. But his campaign has acknowledged Mr Biden needs a strong finish tonight if he is to remain in contention in the next phase of the race. I spoke to some of the surrogates driving his campaign in the Granite State earlier this week. Have a read here.This from David Millward in New England:Politico has been leaked a memo from Unite the Country, a super Pac backing Joe Biden, warning of a split convention with Bernie Sanders squaring off against Mike Bloomberg - the billionaire former New York mayor who, despite having already reportedly spent more than $300 million on advertising, decided against setting foot in Iowa or New Hampshire.Pleading with donors to stay loyal to Mr Biden, Larry Rasky, the Pac treasurer wrote: “Donors hedging their bets on Biden because of Bloomberg could be creating a doomsday scenario for Democrats everywhere. “The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention.It\u0027s a sign of increasing desperation in the Biden campaign, which is bracing itself for another bad result in New Hampshire.Mr Biden has already cut his losses and has headed off to South Carolina where, at least according to the latest polls, he still enjoys a healthy lead over his rivals.Despite leaving New Hampshire for South Carolina, Joe Biden is still asking for late donations in the “Granite State”. He just sent out this email:“As I write this email to you today, New Hampshire is voting in our country’s very first primary. “My team tells me we need another $120,000 before 8pm in order to fully execute our Get Out The Vote efforts in the Granite State. “Will you be the one to push us over the top? Pitch in $5”Nick Allen is at a polling station in the quiet rural town of Henniker.It\u0027s not a record turn out here. There have been 1,276 votes so far in the Democrat and Republican primaries combined, according to the machine that counts the votes in a polling station at the local school. About 70 per cent of the votes are in the Democrat primary. The election moderator says the turnout is about average.Outside, Rod Pimentel was standing with an Amy Klobuchar sign. He said: I\u0027m a progressive, I like everything Bernie and Warren have to say. But we need somebody at the top of the ticket who can reach out. I\u0027d like to see Amy with a running mate from the left of the party. We can\u0027t go into this ided. His friend Scott Osgood, 67, was encouraging people to vote for Elizabeth Warren. He said: She\u0027s got all the best plans, real plans. I think she\u0027ll do good today, good would be the top three. I met Amy too, and that would be OK.Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, greet people campaigning for him outside a polling station  Mr Sanders and his wife, Jane, greeted people campaigning for him outside a polling station in New Hampshire.Michael Bloomberg is the elephant in the room in New Hampshire. His shadow over the Democratic race lengthened today after the billionaire former New York mayor was the surprise winner in Dixville Notch, a hamlet that traditionally votes first in New Hampshire\u0027s primary.Mr Bloomberg has taken an unorthodox approach to the race, opting to skip the first four states to vote and focusing all of his energy in the larger, bigger prize states.  He is not on the ballot in New Hampshire, however residents of Dixville Notch opted to write his name in, resulting in him receiving three of the five votes cast after the stroke of midnight.The ritual in Dixville Notch, dating back six decades, gives a candidate brief bragging rights, as state law does not require polls to even open until 11 am.Bloomberg\u0027s campaign was quick to seize the moment.We\u0027re not competing in NH, but Mike still wins Dixville Notch, his campaign said.While the number of ballots cast there is tiny in the context of the full-state Democratic primary, which drew almost 250,000 voters in 2016, the victor in Dixville Notch has gone on to win two-thirds of the contested major party primaries in the state.Ben Riley-Smith on the reaction \u0027Mayor Pete\u0027 gets from some of his supportersThe nation has comedy show Saturday Night Live to thank for dubbing Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend mayor picking up support, the White Obama. That nickname was going viral over the weekend after it was used in a skit the show did on the Democratic presidential debates. But it is a comparison I found being made by some voters at Buttigieg events back in December when I saw him on the Iowa stump for this magazine profile.Pete Buttigieg greets supporters outside a polling station in Nashua, New HampshireIt also appears to be something Joe Biden, his moderate rival, is concerned about. This guy’s not Barack Obama, Mr Biden said recently. Mr Buttigieg shot back: “Well, he\u0027s right. I\u0027m not, and neither is he. Mr Obama aside, it is clear that some of Mr Buttigieg\u0027s most ardent supporters do see him as embodying a similar sense of hope and optimism. That was true at the campaign event he did in a university hall on Monday morning in the New Hampshire town of Plymouth. Charlene Joyce, 64, stood up at the end of questions before Mr Buttigieg left and declared “I have never, ever felt as energised by anybody as I am by Mayor Pete.She said he was bringing “grace and dignity back to American politics and then started signing \u0027the sun will come up tomorrow. Ms Joyce told The Daily  afterwards: This is a time when we really need kindness in this country. I think Donald Trump has turned us from one of the most powerful countries in the world to a laughing stock.”Another Mayor Petet superfan, 89-year-old Pat Provencher, was covered in Buttigieg badges. She had seen Mr Buttigieg speak in the state in April 2018 and had been supporting him ever since. He has far exceeded our expectations, she said. This is a time when we really need kindness in this country.“I think Donald Trump has turned us from one of the most powerful countries in the world to a laughing stock.”Nick Allen, on the ground in New Hampshire, is picking up strong support for the US senator...She\u0027s the funniest candidate in the race. Regardless of their politics, or choice of candidate, New Hampshire voters have been leaving Klobuchar rallies with a smile on their face.Ms Klobuchar\u0027s anecdotes include how her first campaign slogan was All the way with Amy K, which she doesn\u0027t use any more after realising the connotations.Her zingers include a Sarah Palin-esque one about how she can see Canada from my porch in Minnesota.She also talks emotionally about her roots, including her miner grandfather.The crowds have been getting bigger, and late tracking polls had her in third place behind Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.Ms Klobuchar is something of an open book as politicians go, and it is clear the wave of support for Mr Buttigieg has annoyed her.While he has been a small town mayor she has passed over 100 bills in the US senate, and won every election she\u0027s ever fought, including in Republican areas.Amy Klobuchar on the campaign trail todayI was really impressed with her and I wasn\u0027t expecting to be, said voter Marie Lee, 77, who was wearing a Pete sticker at Ms Klobuchar\u0027s event, and may change allegiance.She\u0027 s got the experience that Pete lacks. She\u0027s been challenged, she added.Joe Foster, the former attorney general of New Hampshire, who\u0027s endorsement is sought after by candidates, said he was backing Ms Klobuchar.She\u0027s a rare talent. I\u0027ve seen a lot of presidential candidates. They all have charisma, but she has an ability to connect with people I haven\u0027t seen in a long time. I saw it with Bill Clinton, it\u0027s a gift. She\u0027s smart, she\u0027s tough, and she speaks from the heart. Ms Klobcuhar appeared confident as she visited a polling station today.Ben Riley-Smith with the significance of tonight\u0027s vote for the leading hopefulsIf the 78-year-old can win again in New Hampshire, as he did four years ago, Mr Sanders will be the front-runner and America will be a big step closer to having a democratic socialist presidential nominee. A political unknown this time last year, Mr Buttigieg, 38, will want to build on a joint-first finish in Iowa. Coming in the top two here will give him a chance of boosting support when the race goes national on Super TuesdayThe former US vice president is expected to have another difficult night. If he comes fourth again - or even fifth? - his campaign will be fully on the rocks, given he has been the front-runner practically since the 2016 election result. The left-wing Massachusetts senator actually did well in Iowa, getting just 6 percent points fewer votes than Mr Sanders and Mr Buttigieg in the second round. But with fellow progressive Mr Sanders dominating she needs to break beyond him somehow. Three months ago few would have predicted the moderate Minnesota senator would have performed this strongly. She came fifth in Iowa and is third in some New Hampshire polls. If she beats Mr Biden here she can claim momentum is building. Only slightly more Democrats voted in Iowa\u0027s caucuses last week than in 2016 - and that has party operatives worried about voter enthusiasm going into November.Will New Hampshire\u0027s Democratic voters surge to the polls or also stay home?New Hampshire\u0027s secretary of state has predicted a healthy 292,000 Democratic voters, which would be about 40,000 more than voted in 2016.As Democratic presidential candidates canvass the state, Nolan Pelletier wears a cape of stars and stripes for a haircut on his 10th birthday at the Parliament Barber Shop in Manchester, NHThe turnout question hangs heavily over the field for two reasons.The start of Democratic voting in the long primary season coincides with a rise in anxiety among that party\u0027s voters about the presidential election and an increase in confidence among Republicans. Low turnout would be a sign of Democratic weakness at the ballot box, at least for now.Second, the candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is premised on the theory that his ultra-liberal platform will turn out new voters, but that didn\u0027t happen in Iowa. Whether more voters cast ballots in New Hampshire may carry big implications for Sanders\u0027 argument.Nick Allen has been speaking to Bernie Sanders\u0027 team.Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ice cream, who has been campaigning for Mr Sanders, told The :“l saw Pete’s got a new ad out, well produced ad. A lot of people just see the ads. You can come up with great ads but Bernie’s been fighting for justice for 40 years.” Without naming names Mr Cohen said other candidates had been saying nice things for three to six months while Mr Sanders had been pursuing his agenda for decades.People could vote for a candidate funded by Wall Street and corporations, or a candidate funded by millions of Americans being screwed by Wall Street and corporations.Habiba Choudhury, 28, a Sanders volunteer who came from New York to knock doors, told The  the media appeared to be backing Mr Buttigieg,and that wasn\u0027t helping Mr Sanders.I think the media focus on Buttigieg is affecting it. They say there’s no bias in the media but there is.As votes are counted in New Hampshire, Joe Biden is shifting ahead to South Carolina, where success is critical to his campaign.Mr Biden\u0027s Democratic presidential campaign says he and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, will travel to Columbia on Tuesday night for a launch party.South Carolina is key to Biden\u0026#39s successRep. Cedric Richmond is Mr Biden\u0027s campaign co-chairman and had already been planning to attend the event.The campaign says Mr Biden will address supporters in New Hampshire via livestream while his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, will thank them in person.Mr Biden has a lot at stake in South Carolina, where he has led polling and has long relationships with the heavily black electorate. But other candidates including Bernie Sanders and billionaire Tom Steyer have been campaigning hard in the state.Mr Biden says in a release he plans to travel later in the week to Nevada, which holds its caucus vote later this month.Ben Riley-Smith, our US Editor, has this from snowy Henniker, New Hampshire:It is easy to read too much into the number of people who turn up to some candidates\u0027 campaign events and not others. Their voters may be less available, like working parents. The events could just be at tricky times of day or especially remote locations. But with that said, the numbers that Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg have been drawing in over the last few days in New Hampshire is telling. Mr Sanders, the left-wing Vermont senator, on Monday night held an eve of poll rally that attracted more than 7,500 people at the Whittemore Center Arena in Durham, New Hampshire. Yes, a lot of them were nearby students and, yes, the allure of the US rock band The Strokes may have played a role. But there was huge energy in the room. Mr Buttigieg, the former South Bend mayor, has not hit those numbers but over the weekend he held a succession of events which drew in more than a thousand people. That has dwarfed the efforts of other candidates like Joe Biden, the former US vice president. His flagging campaign has seen meetings in gym halls with only a few hundred voters. It all points to a critical factor in these races - enthusiasm. It is the lifeblood of campaigns, convincing people to both get involved, knocking doors and making calls, and also turn out to vote. The evidence is, in New Hampshire at least, Mr Sanders and Mr Buttigieg are enthusing their supporters and Mr BIden is not.My colleague David Millward put $5 on Mayor Pete to win the Democrat nomination a year ago.He\u0027s now feeling pretty pleased with himself...Buttigieg fans in New Hampshire on February 9Quite simply, the more people see of Pete Buttigieg, the more they like him – and so do party donors. He raised $24.7 million in the final quarter of 2019 with 326,000 people chipping in. Significantly Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan, has the backing of VoteVets, a political action committee backing liberal veterans for public office.Contrast that with Joe Biden, who was seen as the likeliest standard-bearer of the establishment wing of the Democratic party. His campaign has, to put it mildly, been disastrous.Nick Allen reports from New Hampshire:It\u0027s a big responsibility being a primary voter in New Hampshire. Along with their compatriots in Iowa those who want to can see, even meet, all the candidates and size them up personally. It\u0027s their role to kick the tyres on behalf of the nation, and see if the politicians are up to the job.And they are famed for getting all the information they can - and then deciding late.A child holds a sign supporting Pete Buttigieg, at a rally in Portsmouth, NHAfter seeing Pete Buttigieg making a passionate appeal for votes at a campaign stop, Donna Salviati, 58, a local teacher, was still unsure.He was exciting...but I’m not ready to choose. Pete’s made it into my top three. I’m not telling you who the others are. “I know what my top three issues are. One of those is the opioid crisis. Now, I’m going to have to go back home, look again at what they’ve all said about those issues, read their websites, and newspaper editorials about them. Then I’ll make my choice.Elizabeth Warren says anyone looking for contrasts between her and fellow progressive Bernie Sanders can find them.The Massachusetts senator is stopping at polling stations across New Hampshire on Tuesday to greet people voting in the state\u0027s primary.Elizabeth Warren in Manchester, NH, on February 8Asked if she\u0027d done enough to differentiate herself from Mr Sanders, Ms Warren said there were key differences that were obvious to voters.Ms Warren says she doesn\u0027t want to denigrate Mr Sanders but says she has a deep political record of accomplishments, including helping to create a federal agency to protect consumers during the Obama administration.Both Ms Warren and Mr Sanders have been careful not to criticise each other harshly for months as they compete in the Democratic presidential primary.Elizabeth Warren offers donuts to supporters at a polling site in New HampshireNear a polling station at Portsmouth Middle School, Ms Warren handed out doughnuts to supporters and spoke to a man on a bike, even using his cellphone to urge his daughter to vote.Asked if she had any advice for those heading to the polls, Ms Warren quipped:Vote for me.Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar has visited two polling places in New Hampshire\u0027s largest city on primary day.She\u0027s savouring what she calls her landslide win in two tiny northern communities that voted just after midnight.Ms Klobuchar said in Manchester on Tuesday she was feeling good and had just met a lot of people who voted for her.Amy Klobuchar, pictured during the February 7 debate in Manchester, NHShe says she feels good about those early results in those gigantic voting locations up there.Ms Klobuchar won the Democratic primary in Hart\u0027s Location with six votes and in Millsfield with two. But former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg won Dixville Notch with two write-in votes.Ms Klobuchar says Bloomberg needs to be on the debate stage and then she can be on equal footing with him.She says she\u0027s never going to beat the billionaire on the airwaves but can beat him on the debate stage.Sanders, 78, is forecasted to win an average of 28 per cent of the vote in New Hampshire, according to FiveThirtyEight\u0027s analysis. In 80 per cent of simulations, he wins between 20 and 36 per cent of the vote.He has a 2 in 3 chance of winning the most votes, much better than the second most likely winner, Buttigieg, who has a 3 in 10 chance.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is the favourite to win tonight\u0026#39s pollJoe Biden is portraying himself as an underdog in Tuesday\u0027s New Hampshire primary.The former vice president noted on MSNBC\u0027s Morning Joe that Bernie Sanders of Vermont won New Hampshire by 20 percentage points in 2016 and has a next-door neighbor advantage and real enthusiasm going for him.But Mr Biden says Mr Sanders\u0027 label as a democratic socialist will not be helpful in the South and other places.Mr Biden says I think I\u0027m an underdog here in New Hampshire but he still feels good and is in the race for the long haul.Joe Biden is not expected to win New HampshireMr Biden says their party\u0027s 2020 presidential nominee will need significant support from African Americans as well as keeping working-class white folks, two areas the former vice president sees as his strength.If you can\u0027t win in Pennsylvania, if you can\u0027t help win Senate seats in North Carolina and Georgia, then it\u0027s going to be awful hard to beat President Donald Trump.Mr Biden also took a swipe at billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg for the hundreds of millions of dollars he says they\u0027ve spent on TV advertising.Mr Biden says he\u0027s looking forward to debating Mr Bloomberg because he can\u0027t compete with his money.Asked about polling suggesting Bloomberg is cutting into Biden\u0027s support among moderate Americans, Mr Biden says:It\u0027s amazing what $500 million can do.Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of tonight\u0027s second contest in the race for the Democrat nomination- the New Hampshire primary.Only twice since 1972 have Democrats ultimately chosen a nominee who did not win either Iowa or New Hampshire.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lycra-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And in addition to the strange holes, it also has a mysterious bright spot on its surface.It is also quite large: the rock, known as Pallas, is the third-biggest object in the asteroid belt, and about a seventh the size of our moon. It was first discovered in 1802, but many of its details have remained mysterious.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow scientists have revealed the holey surface of the asteroid in images for the first time – and suggest they could also help solve some of the other mysteries about the object.Over the centuries since it was discovered, astronomers noted that Pallas takes a strange route through the asteroid belt, following a tilted journey when compared with most of the other objects that surround it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

As it moves around the Sun, it has to smash its way through to take its lonely course. Because it comes at an angle, the collisions are especially damaging, leaving the cratered service that has now been revealed in the images.“Pallas’\u0026nbsporbit implies very high-velocity impacts,” says\u0026nbspMichaël\u0026nbspMarsset, the paper’s lead author said in a statement.Asteroid that ended dinosaurs acidified ocean causing mass extinction“From these images, we can now say that\u0026nbspPallas\u0026nbspis the most cratered object that we know of in the asteroid belt. It’s like discovering a new world.”The scientists also found one huge crater on the object\u0027s surface, which is thought to be about 400 kilometres wide. Research suggests that such a large basin would probably have been caused about 1.7 billion years ago, when Pallas was thought to be hit by an object between 20 and 40 kilometres wide, which would have thrown the pieces out into space.As well as the huge variety of holes, Pallas also has a bright spot in its surface, researchers discovered while examining the object.Scientists don\u0027t know where that is coming from. The most likely theory is that it is a huge chunk of salt, which may have been exposed after one of its collisions.People have proposed missions to Pallas with very small, cheap satellites, Marsset says. I don\u0027t know if they would happen, but they could tell us more about the surface of Pallas and the origin of the bright spot.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That requires precise control, and engineers have so far been unable to do it.This is life under the longest internet shutdown in historyNow researchers think they have found a way of controlling that very fast modulation, using sound and light.This is exciting research,\u0026nbspsaid John Cunningham, Professor of Nanoelectronics at Leeds. At the moment, the system for modulating a quantum cascade laser is electrically driven - but that system has limitations.Ironically, the same electronics that delivers the modulation usually puts a brake on the speed of the modulation. The mechanism we are developing relies instead on acoustic waves.When an electron passes through the optical part of the laser, it travels through a host of quantum wells that throw out a pulse of light energy. An electron can emit a number of those photons, and that is controlled – using soundwaves\u0026nbspto vibrate those quantum wells – in the new experiment.Essentially, what we did was use the acoustic wave to shake the intricate electronic states inside the quantum cascade laser, said\u0026nbspTony Kent, Professor of Physics at Nottingham. We could then see that its\u0026nbspterahertz\u0026nbsplight output was being altered by the acoustic wave.The research is not perfect, and more control is still needed before the lasers could be used reliably to transmit data. But with further work they could lead to major breakthroughs in transmitting data.We did not reach a situation where we could stop and start the flow completely, but we were able to control the light output by a few percent, which is a great start, said Professor Cunningham.We believe that with further refinement, we will be able to develop a new mechanism for complete control of the photon emissions from the laser, and perhaps even integrate structures generating sound with the terahertz laser, so that no external sound source is needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brighton’s County Oak medical centre was closed amid reports of workers wearing protective suits cleaning the surgery.On Tuesday evening it was revealed\u0026nbspa healthcare worker at Worthing Hospital, near Hove, is\u0026nbspamong the confirmed cases. Staff at the West Sussex hospital received a memo on Tuesday telling them an employee working in the A\u0026ampE department had been diagnosed with the disease.Public Health England confirmed the newly announced cases were “closely linked” as efforts were made to trace other people who may have been exposed to the virus.The Singaporean authorities are said to be investigating the business meeting, attended by Mr Walsh with his company Servomex, alongside more than 90 other foreign nationals.\u0026nbspServomex said “a limited number of its employees in different countries have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and are now being treated”.Officials hunt for patients of coronavirus-infected healthcare workersTrump cautioned for insisting ‘coronavirus will be gone by April’Should I pick up my family from the airport amid coronavirus outbreak?The Grand Hyatt Singapore, a five-star hotel with 677 guest rooms, said Singapore’s Ministry of Health informed it that three people who attended the conference experienced symptoms after returning to their home countries of Malaysia and South Korea and have now been diagnosed with the virus.The hotel said 94 foreigners stayed at the Grand Hyatt at the same time as the Servomex conference, including people from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak.The hotel said it is now deep-cleaning guest rooms, meeting spaces, restaurants, the fitness centre and other public areas.In Brighton, where several cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed, the County Oak Medical Centre closed its doors after reports one of the doctors working there had contracted the virus. A second branch of the surgery is also closed.Meanwhile in the US a patient in San Diego was accidentally discharged while carrying the virus after being given the all clear.In a statement UC San Diego Health confirmed one of four patients admitted after being evacuated from Wuhan had to be readmitted after further testing found evidence of the virus.The patient had been released into quarantine quarters at an airbase where they were being held for the duration of the virus’s incubation period.“The confirmed positive patient was returned to UC San Diego Health for observation and isolation until cleared by the CDC for release,” the hospital added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is a scandal of our own,” he said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves crash over a lorry on Blackpool waterfront as weather warnings for wind, snow and ice have been issued across large parts of the country.

If this were the case, banks and other financial institutions could base themselves in the UK knowing they might not be frozen out by EU regulators one day to the next.As a result of Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, City firms will lose their automatic passporting rights to keep doing business on the continent.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

The interest from the tech giant could\u0026nbspdraw more tech industries\u0026nbspin the coming years, bringing in\u0026nbspjobs and people.\u0026nbspAlthough the home prices continue to grow in Arlington,\u0026nbspwith the median household costing $729,477, the ersity and potential job opportunities boosted the city onto the list.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 30 most dangerous cities in the world Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The most populous city in Idaho has seen a boom in the last decade from people moving away from areas in\u0026nbspCalifornia in favour of a more affordable market —\u0026nbspa point of frustration for longtime Boise residents.\u0026nbspJob opportunities, specifically in the health and tech industries, aided in the boom of people moving to Boise.

Prices remain affordable for newer residents with Madison\u0027s median home price $277,252Minneapolis experienced a real estate rush in recent years with the interest to redevelop the downtown area into a booming metropolis. Now the city is determined to focus on housing density and keeping homes affordable in the coming years.\u0026nbspWhat helped place Minneapolis on the list is its accessibility for people to get around seamlessly, whether it be by car or on one of its many bike paths. The city also offers a strong\u0026nbspeconomy with the help of giants like Target in town.\u0026nbspHousing prices are anticipated to increase, but\u0026nbspthe rates currently remain affordable with $277,252 as the median home price.\u0026nbspThe least-known city on the list is Provo, Utah. Although the Mountain West city might get overlooked compared to Salt Lake City, it\u0027s seen a 20 per cent population growth between 2014 to 2019 due to interest from millennials.\u0026nbspInterest in Provo is, in part, due to\u0026nbspa range of job\u0026nbspand housing options, attracting people away from the nearby Silicon Valley.Although ersity and the town\u0027s size is lacking, it still earned a place on the list as the city continues to develop into a larger metropolis.\u0026nbspIn recent years, Raleigh\u0027s transformed from an industrial hub to providing jobs in the tech space for workers. These companies have then changed the warehouses scattered around the city into the ideal spaces for them to grow their businesses.\u0026nbspBesides growing job opportunities, the city also reconstructed its downtown area to provide a space for more businesses.\u0026nbspSt\u0026nbspLouis was not a top contender for the list given its issues with ersity and declining population, while also\u0026nbsphigh rankings in areas like walkability and transit. Curbed\u0026nbsplisted\u0026nbspthe city for its potential to grow into a new Midwestern hub, though, with companies like Microsoft and Square\u0026nbspcoming in.\u0026nbspThe city has to answer for its low appeal for a erse population, but there is potential for it to encourage startups to join the larger companies in developing the area.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it. This year a black actor, Micheal Ward, won the Rising Star Bafta for gang film Blue Story. Six years ago,  Years A Slave won Best Picture, competing with epic Hollywood fare like Gravity.If the film or performance is good enough, then the Baftas is colour blind.The real lack of ersity is among British actors. These days most of them went to Eton with Prince William. Now that’s what I call a lack of ersity.A SURVEY reveals that  per cent of Canadians are against paying the £million to-£million-a-year security bill for Harry and Meghan’s new le.Wherever they lay their hats, from Toronto to Tinsel Town, there is only one sucker who will ever pay for Harry and Meghan’s security.

But providing it does so through democratic means only, that should not upset many people.After all, it is up to the people of Northern Ireland, through a referendum, to decide whether they want to remain part of the UK or to join Ireland.Sinn Fein can, however, be relied upon to be even more hostile than Leo Varadkar — up until now Ireland’s leader — towards Britain in trade negotiations with the EU.If the party can score some kind of victory by opposing UK proposals, it will do so, making it more likely we will have no trade deal by December .Sinn Fein has used Brexit to its advantage, trying to drive a wedge between Britain and those in Northern Ireland who traditionally want to stay part of the Union.By negotiating a deal which puts some kind of border down the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson’s government has helped Sinn Fein’s cause. Former Irish leader Bertie Aern claimed yesterday that a referendum on a united Ireland will now come before the end of the decade.“I think a border poll is inevitable,” he said. “I think it’s probably five years off at least but the Sinn Fein position is it should be held within five years.”It is easy to see a scenario in which Northern Ireland votes to leave the UK and join Ireland, followed by a Scottish vote for independence.I am not sure where that would leave Boris’s plans for a Belfast to Stranraer bridge, which of course would have been paid for mostly by English taxpayers.All this said, however, there is little to suggest that those who voted for Sinn Fein on Sunday were motivated by concerns over Brexit or by a desire for a united Ireland.Strip away its dubious past and Sinn Fein is now a party of the Corbynite Left — it wants far greater social programmes, all funded by the wealthy.This could have serious consequences in a country whose economic success is founded on low taxes, especially company taxes. Ireland’s corporation tax rate is just . per cent, compared with  per cent in the UK. That has helped it become a magnet for investment.In terms of GDP per head, Ireland was poorer than the UK  years ago, but now it is signicantly richer.But whatSinn Fein was able to do what Jeremy Corbyn promised to do and soak the rich We might no longer have a Celtic Tiger on our doorstep, but a Celtic Sloth. The likes of Amazon and Google, which have established big presences in Ireland for tax purposes, might want to sht operations to Britain instead.Leo Varadkar had hoped he would be rewarded at the ballot box for holding a tough line in Brexit negotiations, but Ireland’s housing crisis seems to have been a far stronger concern.Ireland, even more so than Britain, has suffered from property booms and busts over the past two decades.Many young people have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to even rent. Sinn Fein did well because it promised a three-year rent freeze and , new homes.These pledges helped the party — which has dominated Republican politics in Northern Ireland — come out of the margins south of the border and break the duopoly of the two main partiesIt won . per cent of the vote, while Fianna Fail, a socially conservative party, won  per cent, and Fine Gael, the more economically and socially liberal party of Leo Varadkar, won just  per cent.If Ireland had Britain’s first-past-the-post system, it would have been a landslide — Sinn Fein topped the poll in  of the country’s  constituencies.But given Ireland’s system of multi-member constituencies, it is far from guaranteed that Sinn Fein will even be in government at all.Before the election, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael both said they would not go into government with Sinn Fein. They could go into coalition with each other.In fact, Fianna Fail was already propping up Fine Gael in a confidence and supply arrangement. But with Sinn Fein topping the poll, this might prove a more dficult position to hold.Sinn Fein says it is exploring trying to put together a government without either of the main parties.But despite winning the biggest share of the vote, Ireland’s political establishment may yet succeed in keeping it out of power — and away from messing up the Irish economy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

between WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations we had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an inidual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease.Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising.It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks.Scientists said last week that they had been grappling to find a proper term for the virus.Crystal Watson, senior scholar and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the BBC: The naming of a new virus is often quite delayed and the focus until now has been on the public health response, which is understandable.But there are reasons the naming should be a priority.The WHO had previously recommended using the temporary name -nCoV, which includes the year it was discovered, n to denote new or novel, and CoV for coronavirus.But it didnt stick and people continued to call it coronavirus.Dr Watson added: The name it has now is not easy to use and the media and the public are using other names for the virus.The danger when you dont have an official name is that people start using terms like China Virus, and that can create a backlash against certain populations.Coronaviruses are named for their crown-like spikes when viewed through a microscope.Health professionals are working to contact anyone who has been in close contact with people who have coronavirus.The majority of those who have been infected with the virus so far have either visited China or been in close contact with someone who has.Butyou are concerned known the signs is one of the best ways to protect yourself from -nCoV.Symptoms usually include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene.If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.If you have ed from Wuhan in the last  days:If you are in Northern Ireland, call your GP.Please follow this advice evenyou do not have symptoms of the virus.Meanwhile, leading symptom-checking provider to the NHS Doctorlink has been updated to help identy patients risk of having coronavirus.Source: NHSDuring a WHO meeting in Geneva today, Dr Ghebreyesus also revealed that the first vaccine targeting the illness could be available within  months.Dr Ghebreyesus added:So we have to do everything today using available weapons.He also urged the world to unite efforts on coronavirus to avoid far more cases and far higher costs.Dr Ghebreyesus asked countries to be as aggressive as possible in fighting Covid-, adding: If the world doesnt want to wake up and consider the virus as public enemy number one, I dont think we will will learn from our lessons.We are still in containment strategy and should not allow the virus to have a space to have local transmission.It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned the spread will get worse before it gets better as he announced greater powers and funding to help tackle the spread of the disease.In a Commons statement, he told MPs: Dealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint. The situation will get worse before it gets better.He also said that new funding was being launched immediately to support any urgent works the NHS needs for the coronavirus response, such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities.Mr Hancock added: Be in no doubt, we will do everything that is effective to tackle this virus and keep people safe.As of Tuesday afternoon, a total of , people have been tested for coronavirus, of which , were confirmed negative and eight positive, the Department of Health said.Earlier, Dr Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, issued a statement on Twitter.He said that, with  per cent of coronavirus cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No mention of economics.So what knowledge, pray tell, could he possibly impart to a room full of high-flyers connected to Wall Street banking giant JP Morgan, particularly when the rumoured fee was million Well, after a brief speech by his we Meghan at the “Alternative Investment Summit” in Miami, Harry was brought on stage as the headline act and, once again, dug deep to mine the deeply painful memory of his mother’s death.Fair enough when he’s using his experience to highlight the work of a mental health charity and help others.But is it really a suitable subject for a big-bucks event where he’s simply being wheeled out like the latest must-see arrival at a freak show As the new royal escapee on the block, his kudos is currently high.But in the law of ever diminishing s, how long before the American big-hitters tire of his well-trodden trope about “one’s mental health” and move on to the next big thing Not long, I’d wager.Then, Harry and Meghan will really start to feel the bite of their brave new world of “financial independence” and that’s when they will become more of a potential liability for The Queen than they already are.As part of the Royal Family, Harry was largely protected from the potential pitfalls of mingling with unvetted people whose activities might later jump up and bite him.Though, admittedly, it didn’t stop Prince Andrew from getting bogged down in the swamp of Jeffrey Epstein’s questionable lestyle.But outside of The Firm The risks are even greater and, given Harry’s obvious naivety and his we’s towering ambition to be a change-maker, they are sitting ducks for any unscrupulous wolves in sheep’s clothing.This appearance at a corporate shindig shouts loud and clear that they are now “royals for sale”.But ultimately, the cost to the reputation of the monarchy could be irreparable.MARGOT ROBBIE’S husband Tom Ackerley was caught casting a wary eye as she enjoyed a hug with her former co-star Leonardo DiCaprio on the Oscars red carpet.He shouldn’t worry.At , she’s far too old for him.JONTY BRAVERY is “scarily intelligent” and built like a rugby player.He is also mentally ill and currently awaiting sentencing for throwing a six-year-old boy over a ft drop at London’s Tate Modern art gallery.He is being detained at a top security hospital, but before the incident he lived in a flat in West London where a team of six carers worked around the clock to make sure he was never left alone.One of them told a court he was, “one of the most challenging mental patients I’ve ever encountered”, ­particularly given his size, aggression and relentless determination to try to escape from them.As we know, something went terribly wrong on the day he was able to grab the poor boy, who is still in hospital.But it doesn’t detract from the fact that whatever his carers are paid to deal   with such a powerful, high-octane charge, it isn’t enough.I couldn’t wouldn’t do it.How about you A COURT has rejected jihadi bride Shamima Begum’s bid to win back her British citizenship.Judges at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission concluded that, despite being  when she ran away to join IS in Syria, it was her own choice and she is no longer Britain’s responsibility.Whatever your view of Ms Begum’s plightthis decision is surely the right one in hopefully serving as a deterrent to any other young people who might be thinking of doing the same.WHILE Hollywood’s glitterati were enjoying the post-Oscars parties, spare a thought for poor Emily Ratajkowski, who was woken in the early hours by a fire alarm at her hotel.As you can see, she was forced to leave her room with only a couple of towels to protect her modesty.What  Oh, apparently this is the dress she wore to the Oscars.Sorry about that.Yep.

He blamed the eye-watering sums - which some MPs want to be spent on local transport instead - on “poor management” by the firm responsible. The Government plans to appoint a minister whose full-time job it would be to manage the project.But Labour accused ministers of being unable to properly manage big infrastructure projects or “keeping a lid” on the costs.And it warned that Mr Johnson had promised much to the people of the Midlands and North during the election - but they would end up “sorely disappointed” when they saw how it worked out.Outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed the PM was fond of announcing “big shiny projects” which didn’t amount to much. Mr Johnson’s own record on such projects includes a Garden Bridge and Thames Estuary Airport which flopped when he was London Mayor. The first stage of High Speed , which will kick off next month, will go from London to Crewe, reducing journey times considerably.  Delivery of the Northern stages to Manchester and Leeds will be reviewed to try to cut costs and speed up the timetable. Mr Johnson wants to integrate the final stages with existing - and future - rail links across the North.   This includes Northern Powerhouse Rail which would stretch from Liverpool to Hull, adding £bn to the total bill.  The PM told the Commons: “We face a historic choice, we can try to get by with existing routes from North to South or we can have the guts to take a decision, no matter how dficult and controversial.” But Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, whose constituency will be cut in two by the HS, said HS was “unloved, unwanted and has been grossly mismanaged”. And Greenpeace’s John Sauven said Mr Johnson’s decision would give him the “dubious honour” of being this century’s largest destroyer of ancient woodlands. Where will HS go  The high-speed railway line will go from London to Birmingham and then a Y-shaped extension in two phases - the first from the West Midlands to Crewe followed by the second from Crewe to Manchester, and Birmingham to Leeds. It will carry m-long trains with as many as , seats each, running at mph and  times an hour in each direction. Building work will begin on the route to Birmingham next month. Whose idea was it Gordon Brown’s Labour government backed the high-speed line in  to address capacity issues on the West Coast mainline. They suggested it should eventually extend to Scotland. But the UK’s first high-speed link came with the opening of the -mile line between London and the Channel Tunnel. HS was supported by the coalition and Theresa May’s government, and now by Boris Johnson.Why do we need it  Britain’s crumbling rail network dates back to the Victorian era and trains are limited to speeds no greater than mph. Demand for both passenger and rail freight has increased dramatically over the last two decades but the capacity of the network has not. With HS more people will be able to use the train and journey times will fall - boosting the economy of the North and Midlands. How much will it cost   The official price tag for HS was announced in the  Budget and came in at just under £bn. The Government now estimates the cost has increased to between £bn and £bn for the whole route. The Oakervee review into the project recommended ministers should proceed - but his deputy didn’t agree and put the final bill as high as £bn. Adding HS right across the Pennines would add at least £bn to the bill.  What went wrong  The PM has blamed poor management by HS Ltd, the firm set up to run the project. The cost has spiralled in part because of unrealistic land and property valuations for the areas it cuts through and the expense of tunnels underneath the Chilterns and central London. Whitehall spending watchdog the National Audit Office blamed the complexity of the project and said risks were under-estimated. Is it worth the money  Successive prime ministers - now including one-time sceptic Boris Johnson - think it will deliver a huge boost to the economy. Doug Oakervee, who led the review into the project, claimed it would give aof £ to £. for every £ spent over  years. But his deputy Lord Berkeley thought it would deliver aof just p. Ministers now think the figure is around £. for each pound invested. How long will the project take to build  Stage one from London to the West Midlands was due to open at the end of . But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admitted last year it could now be - before the first trains run, which has been pushed back to . The second phase to Manchester and Leeds was due to open in -, but that has now been delayed to -. The PM has said he wants the North to feel the benefits well before then. What dference will it make to my journey The DfT claims it will cut journey times from London to Birmingham from one hour  minutes to just  minutes from London to Birmingham.Journeys from London to Manchester will go down from two hours seven minutes to one hour seven minutes, while going from the Midlands to Leeds will take just  minutes. The PM claims journeys from Glasgow to London will be  minutes quicker."},{"url":null,"title":"number 10 steps up revenge","story":"NewsNumber  steps up revenge on judges plan after humiliating deportation blowDominic Cummings said the ruling showed an \"examination\" of judicial review was needed - but others warned Boris Johnsons team is gearing up for a bitter revenge attack on judges after the Brexit battles of last yearShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It comes after the Court of Appeal ruled against the government, preventing them from deporting  foreign offenders scheduled to be on a deportation flight this morning. The Prime Minister has already announced a “constitution, democracy and rights commission” tasked with ensuring judicial reviews are not “abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays.”Mr Johnson was left fuming after judges unanimously ruled his plan to shut down parliament and ram his Brexit plan through was unlawful.Judicial reviewis the process where members of the public can take the government to court to rule on whether their actions are lawful. It’s a crucial power of the court system, and exists to make sure governments - however strong their hold on power - have to operate within the law. The Conservative manesto promised to examine the JR process to ensure it is not abused for political reasons. Downing Street said it bitterly regretted the Court of Appeal decision and Government sources said the row over the deportation flight showed why an examination of JR was needed.  A dozen separate applications for JR were filed in recent days in relation to the deportation flight, sources said. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: The legal process for removing these offenders, which has included repeated appeals and judicial reviews, has already cost the British public tens of thousands of pounds. Dominic Cummings, one of the Prime Ministeraposs closest aides, said there must be urgent action on the farce that judicial review has become following the Court of Appeal decision, ITV News reported. The Tories also seized on Labouraposs criticism of the flight and claimed it showed they have not learned the lesson of the  electoral drubbing. A senior Government source said: The Westminster bubbleaposs view in trying to halt this flight with repeated JRs makes the case perfectly to the public about why such a review is needed and why certain parts of Westminster still havenapost learned the lesson from the  election. Labour has challenged the Government in Parliament about allowing the flight to take off before the findings of the review into the Windrush scandal have been published.Amanda Pinto QC, chair of the Bar Council, said: Judicial review is a hugely important tool in a democratic society by which decisions of public authorities, including government, are subject to legal scrutiny. Far from being a mark of dys, judicial review is an appropriate check on decision-making, of which a nation should be proud.  She added: We have not yet seen details of what a aposreviewapos of the judicial review process might look like, but anything that seeks to limit the ability of ordinary citizens to challenge decisions of those with power is a red flag. Caroline Goodwin QC, of the Criminal Bar Association, said: Judicial review is a process to keep a check on authorities acting beyond the legal remit that may have been granted to them by the law, thus playing a part to ensure the law applies equally to everyone this is what the rule of law means.Shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti said: There is no democracy without the rule of law. These attacks on journalists and judges are chronic symptoms of an entitled Tory Government that is desperate to avoid scrutiny, and is out of control. When the review was first mooted last month, Baroness Chakrabarti told the Mirror it was revenge for losing -nil in the Supreme Court. She added: It’s like losing -nil in the cup final and coming with a baseball bat for the referee.” Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: These Tory attacks on our courts, judicial review and the Human Rights Act are all designed to weaken ordinary people and enable ministers to act with impunity. They are the actions of despots, not democrats.

As of Tuesday afternoon, a total of , people have been tested for coronavirus, of which , were confirmed negative and eight positive. But announcing greater powers and funding to help tackle the spread of the disease, Mr Hancock said there was still a struggle to come. In a Commons statement, he told MPs: Dealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint. The situation will get worse before it gets better. Mr Hancock said the risk to the public remains moderate and the eight patients with confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK are receiving expert care. Tracing those who have been in contact with the first four cases is now complete and tracing those who have been in contact with the remaining four cases is ongoing, he told MPs. On new powers to force people to remain in quarantine, he said: The powers are proportionate and will help us slow down the transmission of the virus and make it easier for NHS and public healthstaff to do their jobs. Mr Hancock also announced new capital funding for the NHSthey need to create further isolation areas and other necessary facilities. He said: Today I can announce to the House the immediate launch of a capital facility to support any urgent works the NHS needs for the coronavirus response such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities. Responding, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: I understand why the Secretary of State has invoked the regulations that heaposs entitled to do under the Public Health Act. He has our support. Quarantine arrangements must be seen to be necessary, proportionate and in accordance with law.  And enforcement of those arrangements including with powers of restraint where necessary must be fully transparent and the rights and freedoms of the quarantined evacuees must be fully understood, so as to ensure they are treated with dignity and respect. So we agree that a legislative framework for this is far preferable to ad hoc contracts that were the original basis for the quarantine and in order to maintain public confidence in these arrangements that framework must be understood and scrutinised by Parliament.

People such as the sales executive, who picked it up in Singapore, are victims too. The ease and speed at which this virus is unknowingly transmitted is causing serious concern and isolating the strain is a priority. However avoiding panic is vital or the health teams responding will be overwhelmed by  alarms and irrational fear. The old wartime advice to keep calm and carry on is as apt as ever though we can all improve general personal hygiene by, for example, washing our hands frequently and never sneezing near others. But this is a moment to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Tracking down and isolating those infected is the best way of slowing, then ending, the spread of this killer.

Scout leader Steve Walsh, , today told of his concern for the  Brits he has infected from his hospital bed in a London isolation unit. Health authorities are trying to trace hundreds of people he and other Brits he infected came in to contact with since theirto the UK. The group of friends who have tested positive include two GPs and the outbreak has seen two doctors surgeries and a care home closed in the Brighton area. Two teachers at sales executive Mr Walsh’s daughter’s school were today ordered to “self isolate”. He is in quarantine at London’s St Thomas’ Hospital after picking up the disease at a Singapore gas conference at the end of last month. He then come home to Hove in East Sussex via a skiing holiday. Friends who he stayed with in a chalet in the French Alps have also tested positive and half of the groups had ed to the UK.  Mr Walsh said in a statement: “I would like to thank the NHS for their help and care. “Whilst I have fully recovered, my thoughts are with others who have contracted coronavirus. “As soon as I knew I had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus I contacted my GP, NHS  and Public Health England. “I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. “When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves. “I also thank friends, family and colleagues for their support during recent weeks and I ask the media to respect our privacy.” Mr Walsh is assistant cub scout leader at the rd Hove St Leonards Scout Group where the children know him as Shere Khan. Ian Henshall, a -year-old author, has lived next door to Steve Walsh for  years.  He said: “I’ve spoken to his we Cathy directly and to Steve by email and they are absolutely terried of being made scapegoats for all this which would be totally unfair. “He acted as quickly as he possibly could as soon as he got ill. They are a lovely family. He is feeling fine now and Cathy is hoping he will be able to leave isolation and come home soon. “They are just obviously very concerned about being made scapegoats in all this.” Two teachers at the primary school where one of Mr Walsh’s two children normally attends were today in “self-isolation”. Authorities at Cottesmore St. Mary Catholic Primary in Hove have now told parents they are allowed to keep their children at homethey are at all concerned. It is understood Mr Walsh’s young daughter is usually a pupil in Year Six at the school. And head teacher Rachel Breen has now written to parents telling them of the two “staff isolations” which were being carried out to “reduce the risk of the virus spreading”. Mrs Breen explained: “We have been informed that two people, from our school, have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate for  days after coming into contact with a Coronavirus case.  “I appreciate it may be concerning that people have been told to ‘self-isolate’. However, this is a purely precautionary measure to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading. “As part of self-isolation neither person is in school.” Parents were told they could keep their children off schoolthey wish. Steve lives with his we Catherine and contracted the virus during a conference at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore organised by Servomex, a British gas analytics company he works for, more than two weeks ago. He then travelled to Les Contamines-Montjoie, near Megeve, for a ski break to stay with friends Bob Saynor and his we Dr Catriona Saynor, who own the chalet where  people were exposed to the virus. They are both believed to have coronavirus and so has their nine-year-old son. Mr Walsh flew from Geneva to London on an easyJet plane with -plus passengers and crew before going to his local pub, The Brigadier in Hove. He also attended a yoga class at a local community centre. He went on to call NHS  with concerns about coronavirus and was advised to go to Royal Sussex County Hospital Brighton, for testing. Separately two prisoners at Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire were being tested for the bug and awaiting results. They were reportedly tested after a man who transferred from a jail in Thailand collapsed in his cell tonight. All prisoners on C-wing were being kept under lockdown in their cells last night. The Saynors live in France for most of the year and school pupils and teachers who came in close contact with the nine-year-old boy have been told to self-isolate for two weeks.  Dr Saynor and another male GP were among the recent four Brits to test positive in the UK, bringing the total to eight. Before being isolated it is feared they came in to contact with patients and staff at two branches of the County Oak Medical Centre as well as Patcham Nursing Home. All have been closed and are undergoing decontamination. One of the GPs’ patients, a -year-old mother-of-four from Brighton, said: “I was here on the February rd and the th and they will not tell me the risk even though I am immunosuppressed with lupus. “Nobody knows anything. It’s a farce. Everybody is worried about it. No-one can protect themselves and we can’t protect the public. I am going to ring  and [Public] Health England until I get some answers.” GP surgeries across Brighton are questioning patients on their possible exposure to an infected person before they are being granted an appointment. Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director of Public Health England , said: “I should say that the people who are of concern are those who have had very close contact with somebody with coronavirus - face-to-face contact or within a two-metre range for  minutes or more.”  “A small number of them will be patients who these healthcare workers have been involved with treating but it is actually a relatively small number.” The eight cases in the UK include Mr Walsh, the five friends he infected, and two Chinese visitors who had been staying in York. Five more Brits staying at the French chalet have tested positive. Four are under quarantine in France while one man had ed to his home in Majorca. Public health officials have been accused of ‘losing control’ and keeping ‘secrets’ from the public. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: “Patient confidentiality is important but we may now be at the point where the public’s need to know more information is greater. “It would be helpful to know[Mr Walsh] got a taxi straight home or got a bus and stopped off at the supermarket. Letting the public know this timeline will reassure many that they are not at risk.” It comes as the head of the World Health Organisation announced a name for the new coronavirus - Covid-.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailCampaigning mum Marie McCourt was praised for her “bravery and determination” in the House of Commons as ‘Helen’s Law’ moved one step closer to reality. Marie, , attended Parliament with husband John Sandwell, , to hear the second reading of the bill passed unanimously. For over an hour MPs from all parties gave emotive speeches in support of the law - with one describing it as being of “particular public interest and importance”. Justice Minister Chris Philp added: “We are striking a blow today for the rights of victims, a blow for the rights of their families who deserve to be able to move on with their lives following crimes of the most appalling kind.” Marie’s MP Conor McGinn also publicly thanked the Mirror for supporting the campaign for many years. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: “This is a short bill, it consists of just three clauses but its importance cannot be underestimated. “It responds directly to real-le issues that we know have caused, and continue to cause, immense distress to the families of victims of serious crimes. “Despite its full and proper title this is a bill that we have all come to know as ‘Helen’s Law’. “...Helen’s mother Marie McCourt has long campaigned for this change in the law. “I want to take this opportunity, and I’m sure the whole house will want to join me, to pay tribute to her bravery, her determination and her tenacity.” Helen McCourt, , was murdered by pub landlord Ian Simms as she walked home from work in . Her body has never been found despite three decades of searches by her devoted mum and family.  Many of the MPs who spoke during todayaposs session have constituents who have suffered similar heartbreak. Stephen Metcalfe MP referenced Linda Jones, whose -year-old daughter Danielle was murdered by her uncle in . The schoolgirl’s body has never been found but her killer Stuart Campbell is up for parole next year. MP Metcalfe said: “This is not some technical law change, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is about real people, real victims, real families and real hurt and anguish.  “This is about Helen McCourt and her family, about my constituent Linda Jones and her family and her murdered daughter Danielle Jones. “And it’s about all the families who have been denied the opportunity to put to rest a loved one killed or murdered in the most distressing way.” Justice Minister Philp challenged Campbell directly saying: “The message that Stuart Campbell and other people like him should hear loud and clear, on this day, from this house, is that their failure to disclose is unacceptable.  “It is abhorrent and they should make that disclosure right away.” Helen’s Law, launched by the Mirror in , means parole judges will be legally obliged to consider “non-disclosure” by prisoners when considering release requests. There was anger in the House that the legislation may have come too late for Marie, who received the news last week that killer Simms, now , had been released. But she has pledged to keep fighting against his freedom and is still awaiting a Judicial Review of the decision to grant him parole. MP McGinn, of Saint Helens North, said: “It is bittersweet because as many in the House will know, just last week Helen McCourt’s murderer was released from prison.  “...The parole board in my view made an appalling decision.” The PrisonersBill contains a second section relating to non-disclosure by sex offenders. Vanessa George recently walked free from a  year prison sentence after abusing children at the nursery where she worked. Parents of the youngsters who attended the nursery still have no idea whether their kids were among her victims.

Having read up on ‘gentle’ parenting, she follows the method based on mutual respect and willingness, rather than demands and rules. Her kids decide for themselves what and when to eat and when to sleep - usually falling asleep between pm and am. And Nic insists her technique has tackled meltdowns and made for a happier home. It all began when Nic discovered a rigid routine did not work well with her aposspiritedapos eldest George, eight. But now Nic, , swears by ‘unschooling’– where children learn only what they want to, rather than following a set curriculum. The blogger from Rochdale, who studied childcare at college, lets her kids choose how to structure their days. And Nic, who is also mum to Ellie, seven, and Aimee, six, insists her brood are creative, kind and love learning as a result of their bohemian upbringing. She explained: “There is no schoolwork - it’s mostly discussion. Children are naturally curious. They will ask questions, and we will offer them an answer, or research it together using the internet or books. “I learn myself alongside them. For example, Aimee will ask me how something works, like the veins in her wrist, and we talk about that. “They love to listen to me read classic literature, so we will read Shakespeare and Dickens together. At the moment, we’re reading Percy Jackson, which is teaching us about Greek mythology. “I respect them as people and as equals. I guide them and teach them - but we are still equals.” Nic, who co-parents her children with their father - her ex-husband, factory worker Kyle Dex,  - had a conventional upbringing herself, but found that attending a mainstream school took the joy out of learning. Her early experiences with education were also marred by the fact that, growing up, she was bullied at school. She added: “I had a fairly average upbringing. My mum was neither strict nor lenient, and I was educated at school. I found it killed any love of learning for me, because everything was forced.”  Then, having learned about dferent styles of parenting whilst studying childcare, she decided to adopt an ‘authoritarian’ approach after George was born in April . “I was taught a very linear punishment and reward type system, which I was using at first,” she said. “But I soon realised that wasn’t going to work with George. “He was a very spirited child and would have meltdowns. The punishment and reward system wasn’t making either of us happy.” So, when George was around two and in nursery, Nic decided to change tack, having read up on ‘gentle’ parenting - a method based on mutual respect and willingness, rather than demands and rules, where a parent will offer guidance, but ultimately, children make their own decisions.  She recalled: “I noticed a dference immediately. I told George, ‘You choose what you want to do,’ and from then on, we weren’t struggling anymore. Before, he’d have several meltdowns a day. He was losing it over everything we tried to control and getting frustrated with us telling him what to do - but we changed our methods and they reduced to just a couple a week.” George remained in nursery for just eight weeks, then Nic and Kyle agreed to remove him. She added: “We weren’t happy with him being there. It felt wrong to have him away from the family.” Since then, George has not set foot in a mainstream school – and neither have his siblings. Nic added: We did try home-schooling where we focused on set topics, but this didnapost really work, because we were missing out on things we wanted to learn. Then, we learned about unschooling online in parenting and home education groups. Describing her family as being at the aposextreme endapos of unschooling, Nic said that the first drastic change made was to their daily routine - scrapping mealtimes and bedtimes.  “We allow the children to come to us when they are hungry,” she explained. “I will leave snacks out for them to pick at, like breadsticks, bits of fruit and veg and sweets and chocolatethey wish, orthey want a meal, we will decide together what they are going to have, so it gives them control. “We have taught them about food, what their bodies need and the dferent nutrients and will cook together. “They usually go to sleep between pm and am. They have never gone to sleep on their own. I will sit with them and we will sing or listen to a podcast. “I remember as a kid feeling sad waiting to fall asleep, or having a nightmare, and I never want them to feel like that. I want it to be this lovely, cosy experience for them. “They fall into a natural rhythm and will sleep and wake when they want to. I’ll only set an alarmwe have to be somewhere.”  With no set bedtime either, the family spend the evening watching movies, reading books, doing arts and crafts, or learning. Curiosity, rather than curriculums, dictate exactly what the children learn each day, and a lot of their education is very hands-on. Nic continued: “As long as they are not breaching health and safety, they can do what they like. We love getting out in nature and spend a lot of time camping. We learn about foraging and dferent animals. “George became interested in bushcraft and started making bowls from branches. He also likes trains and trams, so we went on a tour to find out how they – and electricity – work. “He does a lot of video gaming, like Minecraft, so has learned how to type, read and write notes to his friends through that. “We have never sat down and done a lesson on reading and writing. They are just picking it up. The girls’ vocabulary is unbelievable. “I can’t imagine them being sat in a classroom. When I compare what they would have to do at school with what they do today, I realise it would never work for them.” When it comes to discipline, Nic believes that by having healthy discussions, rather than punishing her children, she will guide them towards making their own decisions. If any family members are ever feeling frustrated, they will have apostable timeapos, where everyone gathers to discuss their issues.  She said: “The conventional thinking is that you have to tell children what to do otherwise they won’t do it, but from my point of view, when you give them the information, they are good at processing that information and meeting their own needs. “I’m not perfect and will lose my temper but we do not do punishment, we try to do everything through discussion.” Hoping that she is raising three independent children who know their own minds, Nic also allows the children free reign over their appearance, letting them dye their hair or wear make-upthey want to. Ellie is creative and loves cosmetics and colouring her hair bright green, while Aimee previously insisted on wearing odd shoes for a year-and-a-half. “They like to decorate their clothes with paint,” Nic said. “If they want to wear pyjamas in the daytime, they are allowed to. We have a single box of clothes and they can choose from there.“As long as it’s safe, the clothes are clean and weather appropriate then I don’t mind. It’s allowing them to be creative.Although she cannot see them wanting to, Nic says she would enrol the children into a mainstream schoolthey expressed a wish to go. “You can’t say have autonomy in one area and not another - although I can’t see why they would choose formal education over the freedoms they have now,” she said. She says people do question her methods, but they are mostly just curious, or surprised that unschooling is legal. Under current UK law, parents are permitted to teach their children at home, either full or part-time, and do not have to follow the national curriculum. However, they must ensure their children are in full-time learning from the age of five, and councils can make informal inquiries to check that a suitable education is being given. On one occasion, Nic was told by a stranger that her children aposwill never get on in leapos unless she puts them into a mainstream school – but she disagrees, and has high aspirations for George, Ellie and Aimee.

We used to be jealous of what other clubs were doing before but we’re now probably one of the frontrunners.“We’re doing a lot of things other teams are aspiring to do. Because of the money and finance put in, it certainly makes your job a lot easier and helps a long way.“When you’re attracting young players to join the club, you want the kids to come into an elite environment rather than what it was before.“We weren’t bad before but there was no finance to do it properly. Andy Goldie is driving it on and we’ve managed to get to Elite status which is brilliant.“Restructuring the whole thing has meant new faces have come in with new ideas.“It’s about evolving all the time, you can’t just sit and accept it because that’s what was happening  or  years ago.”That said, Bow still believes attitude is what will help players get to where they want to be, citing former United man and Liverpool star Andy Robertson as an example.“That’s one of the biggest things I see with kids that are talented,” he added.“It’s how you install it into them to give that extra %. When you come out the other end of an academy, that’s the bit that will help you.“You need to be disciplined. Even since I played, and it’s changed a lot since then, football’s been like that.“You can’t go out every night, you’ve got to practice things and get the basics right first before you work on your game.“We’re wanting to give them the whole package by putting all the fragments together and glue them so we get better players at the end of the day. vw, px\"  “I’m a great believer in always getting to where you want to go.“You could stay here, play in the first team and,you’re good enough, you could always move.“We’ve had one recently with Banksy .“Andy Robertson is a fine example, to have came from Queen’s Park then come up here.“From us he probably could’ve gone straight to a Liverpool or a higher team but he went to Hull and earned his stripes.“Sometimes they want to accelerate it and get from down at E right up to A straight away, rather than working their way up.“That’s the way it goes sometimes and I’ve seen others like wee Gauldy .“I’d have put my mortgage on wee Gauldy being a success at Sporting eventually but, unfortunately for him, things turn out dferent ways.“He’s still playing in Portugal, of course, but he was the one I thought would’ve kicked on.“If I’d looked at Andy and Gauldy back then I’d have probably said Gauldy was the better player.

It was very late in my international career and very early in his to be fair!“But you just have to look at his career to see the quality he’s got. You don’t play in the Premier League for as many years as he did without being a very, very good footballer.“These are the guys that can turn it round for Dundee – the big characters.“The season I captained the team to the Championship title, we had loads of characters in that dressing-room, and it kept us going through what was a rollercoaster season.“It was touch and go at times but guys like Peter McDonald, Ian Davidson, myself, Kyle Benedictus and Christian Nade kept it ticking over.“You need leaders in any successful team, and with Christophe and Graham in the current side, they should be the ones setting the standards.”Standards of late have not been high enough at Dens Park.A run of four Championship games without a win since the festive season has seen the Dens men drop out of the play-off places.For a side who started the season with designs on a title charge, that is a cause for concern.But Rae believes the talent peppering the Dee squad ought to be enough to turn the tide – and ensure at least a shot at a quickfireto the Premiership.“If you look at the Dundee side, there are guys with plenty of Premiership experience there,” he said.“You’ve got Jack Hamilton at the back, Christophe in front of him, Dorrans in the middle, Kane Hemmings up top . . . the list goes on.“These are the guys James McPake will be asking to drive the team on in the second half of the season. vw, px\"  “They’ve been there and done it – some of them at a very high level.“So you have to think thatthey turn it on, they’ve got enough about them to get Dundee firing again.“Things have been tough in recent weeks and being out of the play-off places is not good.“The players have to fight to turn that round because another season in the Championship isn’t ideal – and it could easily happen.“But, for me, there should be enough experience and quality there to turn the tide.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/19831881-940x552.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 partick hemmings double earns dark blues first win of 2020 with dominant display","story":"Dundee finally picked up their first victory of  with a dominant - victory over bottom club Partick Thistle at Dens Park.Two first-half Kane Hemming goals did the damage for the Dark Blues as they moved back into the play-off places with a first three points since beating the Jags at Firhill on December .Dens boss James McPake made three changes after Cammy Kerr and Jordan McGhee underwent surgery during the week.That saw Josh Meekings come in to join Christophe Berra and Jordon Forster in a back three while Paul McGowan ed to partner Kane Hemmings up front and Christie Elliott made his first start.Andrew Nelson was on the bench after recovering from surgery himself alongside new signing Tom Field.The home side made a positive start and got the all-important breakthrough on  minutes.It stemmed from Meekings launching a throw into the Partick box and earning a corner. Declan McDaid lofted the kick into the box for Forster to steam in and head goalwards, only to see striker Hemmings knock it in on the line.Minutes later Dario Zanatta flashed a low shot wide of Conor Hazard#s post before Hemmings got his second of the afternoon on  minutes.Shaun Byrne#s long punt up top was miscontrolled and McGowan was all over the mistake. He played in his strike partner, who brushed off the Partick defence to fire past Scott Fox.Partick came out with more le about them in the second half with Zanatta a threat but Dundee were still creating chances and went close six minutes after the restart.First, McDaid saw a low cross kicked away by goalkeeper Fox before Ross Callachan was played in but could only hit the keeper with his effort from inside the area.On the hour, Christie broke forward but took the wrong option in choosing to shoot rather than pass before Fox again beat out a dangerous McDaid cross on  minutes.On  minutes, Dundee lost Callachan as he was stretchered off injured with Nelson replacing him.With six minutes to go, Brian Graham looked to have the chance to give the Jags a leline but he handled when controlling and the chance was gone.In the closing stages the Dark Blues were happy to see the game out as they moved back to fourth spot, three points behind second-placed Inverness.Dundee: Hazard, Forster, Meekings , Berra, McDaid, Christie, Byrne , McGowan, Dorrans, Callachan , Hemmings .Subs not used: Hamilton, Field, Cameron, Strachan.Partick: Fox, Penrice, O#Ware , Brownlie, Cardle , Bannigan, Graham, Cole, Zanatta, Barjonas , O#Connor .Subs not used: Sneddon, Robson, Austin.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/02/Dundee-v-Partick-350x564.jpg ","title":"field set to make bow against jags","story":"Left-back Tom Field is set to be thrust straight into the Dundee starting line-up this weekend.The -year-old joined the Dark Blues late last Friday after news of first-choice Jordan Marshall’s injury came back worse than first feared.Scan results on the thigh injury Marshall picked up in training arrived around lunchtime on the day of the transfer deadline.That forced manager James McPake into swt action to add cover in the shape of Field, who had left boyhood club Brentford earlier that day.With the late arrival, last weekend’s clash at Greenock Morton came too soon to make his debut with Jordan McGhee playing in the unfamiliar role on the left of defence.After meeting his new team-mates and training all week, Field is now likely to make his bow in dark blue against Partick Thistle on Saturday.To give him some match action, Field took part in a bounce game at Stirling Albion on Tuesday in which Andrew Nelson and Paul McGowan also featured after missing out at Cappielow through injury.Nelson, who scored in the match, has been out since the turn of the year after surgery to fix a broken hand.After seeing Christophe Berra and Christie Elliott make their debuts at Morton with Conor Hazard making a second bow after ing on loan, Field is likely to make his first outing against the Jags.Manager James McPake said: “Tom Field trained this week.“Jordan Marshall being out is disappointing because he’s been excellent.“He will miss eight weeks at least, maybe .“It’s a problem deep in the thigh muscle so it’s dficult to know when it has healed.“Jordan is an explosive player so we have to make sure he is right with that one.”Berra, meanwhile, made his first appearance in over a month last weekend and manager James was pleased with his start to le at the club.He added: “Christophe was good. At the end, he admitted he was tired, it was his first  minutes in six weeks so, for that, he was really good.“Jordon Forster was really good beside him and the full-backs did well.“It’s not easy when balls come into your box constantly but I thought they held their own.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d809951299439.77376504-910x564.jpg ","title":"michelin pledges 5m investment in dundee area with at least 850 jobs expected to be created","story":"Michelin is relaunching a scheme which the company says will help create hundreds of jobs in Dundee and Angus, worth around £ million.Michelin Development will provide funding and advice to firms with the potential to expand – providing high-quality, long-term employment, bosses have said.The firm said #at least  jobs are expected to be created# and Michelin Development has also #targeted support for  new jobs#.Funding from Michelin Development could be used to attract companies involved in the green transport industry to the new Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc .MSIP is a joint venture between Dundee City Council, Michelin, and Scottish Enterprise.It aims to drive growth and ersity in the Scottish economy while addressing the global climate emergency.Bosses aim to deliver #a world class innovation centre, driving global research  while influencing and supporting breakthroughs in sustainable mobility and low carbon energy#.The news comes as politicians and business leaders from across the region will attend an event today to learn more about the £m programme.Successful applicants could receive unsecured, heavily-subsidised loans and free, independent and expert advice to pave the way for growth, Michelin Development said.It was announced in November  that the firm would close the plant, with the loss of all  jobs.The tyre factory is due to cease production by the middle of   after the French firm deemed it #unsuitable# in the current climate.Michelin Development said it will target inward investment by providing grants for companies looking to set up in Dundee.Bosses are urging businesses with high potential, and medium-sized enterprises in and around Dundee, Arbroath, Carnoustie and Forfar – or businesses considering investing in these areas – to get in touch.Mike Cole, head of Michelin Development in the UK, said: “Manufacturing, engineering or business to business service companies with fewer than  employees are eligible.“If you have a solid business plan and the potential to create high-quality jobs, but you just need that bit of extra help, then we want to hear from you.“Michelin Development is here to support employment in and around Dundee by helping high-potential firms and entrepreneurs turn their ambitions into reality.”Loans of up to £, are available, and they can be used to lever additional funding from other sources.The event will take place at the MSIP – and funding from Michelin Development could be used to attract companies involved in the green transport industry to the new facility.At least  jobs are expected to be created at MSIP, and Michelin Development has also targeted support for  new jobs.John Reid, Michelin Dundee factory manager and the chief executive of MSIP, said: “This is a signicant announcement for MSIP, for the Michelin Group and for the Dundee area as a whole.“When we announced in  that the Michelin Dundee factory was to close in , we pledged to support our employees and deliver a legacy that will benefit the regional economy for generations to come.“We are determined to create at least  jobs on the Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc and Michelin Development is another string to our bow.

the s.From horse-drawn affairs to the more modern electric offerings, trams were a popular and easy way to travel around the city.A new book illustrating the forgotten history of Aberdeen’s famous trams is to be published later this month.Author Peter Waller’s The Lost Tramways Of Scotland: Aberdeen is due to hit the shelves on February .It explores the rich history of the mode of transport.Published by Graffeg, the book aims to draw attention to the transport system, and documents how it was developed in Aberdeen throughout the years, and how it affected the community.It also looks into the social history of the city from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries.Each page includes stunning photos of the historic vehicles, taken from the Online Transport Archive, which show the layout of the streets at the time.Mr Waller, director and secretary of the Online Transport Archive, has been writing about transport for the past  years.Aberdeen had two electric tramways – the corporation’s services within the city and the Aberdeen Suburban Tramways Co, although this was short-lived.The vehicles covered a large portion of Aberdeen, going as far as Bankhead, Bucksburn, Woodside, Kittybrewster, Bridge of Don, the Beach, Torry, Duthie Park, Bridge of Dee, Woodend and Hazlehead and into the West End as far as Bieldside.City centre areas such as Queens Cross, Rosemount, Union Street and Ferryhill were also serviced.Depots were created to house the vehicles.The first such depot to be built was in Queens Cross.It opened on August  .In the years after Second World War it was also viewed as one of the safest tramways in the United Kingdom.Mr Waller said it had been hoped that the Aberdeen trams would have enjoyed a secure future at the end of the Second World War.However, they were rendered obsolete by the introduction of the diesel bus. The final trams ran on May  .A final procession was made up of a restored horse tram which was followed by six electric cars.Following this event all of the remaining trams were burned at the beach, including the modern, streamlined cars.In the book Mr Waller states: “These had been offered to both Blackpool and Glasgow, but neither was interested in acquiring them.“Although no Aberdeen electric tramcar was preserved following closure, one of the horse trams operated by Aberdeen District Tramways, built by R  J Shinnie in  and converted into an electric car in about , was preserved on withdrawal in  and restored as a horse tram.“The preserved horse tram is normally on display at the Grampian Transport Museum.”A book on Dundee’s tramways has also been published as part of the Lost Tramways of Scotland series.The series also exists for England and Wales, and includes many cities, including Southampton, Nottingham, Coventry, Bristol, Brighton and Bradford."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"north east bursary scheme open to community groups","story":"A bursary of £, for north-east groups has been opened.Housebuilder CALA Homes is inviting community groups, good causes, charities and schools in the area to apply for a share of the funding.Since it launched in , more than  groups in the north-east have benefited from the money.Mike Naysmith, managing director at CALA Homes , said: “CALA is committed to making a positive and lasting contribution to communities.“We look forward to hearing from an even wider breadth of local charities and good causes, and discovering not only the vital dference they make to the community, but also how we can support, sustain and amply the great work that is being done in the area.”To apply, visit cala bursaryApplications for the CALA community fund close on March ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50211893-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"derek mcinnes hopes aberdeens struggles are behind them after win over hamilton","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes hopes his team can #build some momentum# after tonight#s - Premiership win at Hamilton.The Dons ended a five-game goal drought after  minutes against Accies, with summer signing Curtis Main lobbing Luke Southwood for just his second counter of the campaign.Niall McGinn and Connor McLennan added two more for the Reds before the break, with Marios Ogkmpoe netting a late consolation for the home side.McInnes, who had been under the most pressure of his Pittodrie reign going into the game following Saturday#s - Scottish Cup draw with Kilmarnock, told BBC Sportsound: #It#s was an important three points for us.

It has happened to other good sides.“There is no substitute for hard work and we have been doing that Monday to Friday.“In the training sessions the manager has been analysing and the players have also been analysing things.“We are looking at our own game, looking to bring more responsibilty for ourselves and bring more all over the pitch.“Of course it is frustrating that we are not getting results we as players want or the supporters want.“We could hear their frustration at the end and the players are exactly the same.“It is just not happening for us at the top end of the pitch and we need to find answers to that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.33243395-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.33243395-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.33243395-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.33243395-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen end goal drought to jump to third in the premiership","story":"Aberdeen ended their five-game goal drought to leap-frog Motherwell into third spot in the Premiership.The Dons beat Hamilton -

up at half-time.Main#s introduction was one of three changes to the starting XI held - at the weekend by Kilmarnock in the Scottish Cup fth round.Also coming into the team were McLennan and Dylan McGeouch.Shay Logan and Dean Campbell dropped to the bench.Although Aberdeen dominated early possession. it was Hamilton who created the first opportunity when David Templeton broke in on goal and lted the ball over the out-rushing Joe Lewis, but the shot went wide.MAIN ended the goal drought  after  minutes when a long ball down the left flank from Andy Considine found the re-instated striker who broke past Sam Woods with an angled run.Collecting with a superb first touch, Main raced into the box then brilliantly lofted a chip over keeper Luke Southwood.An Aberdeen bar had promised to give every punter a free pintAberdeen scored from open play tonight.The pints were on the Dons!Seven minutes later Aberdeen were - up when Main, with his back to goal, flicked a pass to Lewis Ferguson.The midfielder then passed to McGINN, who confidently fired home.Aberdeen#s attacking edge was back.Hamilton suffered a blow in the th minute when Brian Easton was taken off injured having landed awkwardly and injured his collar bone.He was replaced by Shaun Want.Aberdeen made it -

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory. The first part of the race ended at Ardrishaig, after which the yachts went through the Crinan Canal.The winners at Ardrishaig were:-Class . st Sally of Kamesh m s.nd Fulmarh m srd Vandah m sExtract from the Glasgow Herald of Monday, July :-Clyde Cruising ClubThe  yachts which raced from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory under the burgee of the Clyde Cruising Club got a rare dusting and with as much wind as they wished the bigger boats came into their own. The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages. The -metre yacht Cerigo arrived first at Tobermory from Crinan in  secs short of  hours.Results:-Class  Fulmar– h m s Sally of Kames– h m s Arcturus– h m sVandah m s. Helenh m s. Torridonh m s.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

At this stage of the nationrsquos history, to permit one party to control the narrative around the future of Scotland is to fatally wound the way our democracy should work. Independence needs a plurality of voices and of thought. A singular, clunking, hierarchical party machine isnrsquot fit for such a momentous task.But praise where itrsquos due, the SNPrsquos great success is the journey itrsquos taken from the fringes of political le to representing the status quo.

Many voters, who see independence as their prime political ambition, hold the SNP to lower standards than they would any other party.They turn a blind eye to the partyrsquos failings because the SNP is seen as the only vehicle which can achieve independence. You donrsquot shoot your own horse when itrsquos in a race ndash you cheer it on at the top of your voice.The SNPrsquos enmeshment in the Yes movement works like a force field, protecting it from flak and scandal that would destroy any other party.This is great for the SNP but not so much for Scotland. The SNP record on health, education, policing, drug deaths, homelessness and economics, is increasingly poor, yet it just keeps dodging bullets. That big Yes badge on the partyrsquos lapel keeps it safe. The Saltire has become a political bullet-proof vest.Even damaging scandals seem to have little effect. The Derek Mackay story wonrsquot fatally wound the party. Therersquos been much talk of the Mackay case spelling the beginning of the end for the SNP. It wonrsquot. Voters who want independence will take the shame and the scars and move on.However, the Mackay scandal will have negative political fall-out for the Yes movement. The great damage done is in the eyes of undecided voters and soft No voters, the swithering centre ground of the constitutional debate. The SNPrsquos increasingly alienating and uninspiring behaviour will deter those most needed to win independence. New voters wonrsquot be gained.Of course, the SNP is hammered in the Unionist press. But there are Nationalist journalists who make no bones of their bias too. One commentator said before the last election that theyrsquod not be making any criticism of the SNP until votes were cast and the party assured victory. It all feels a little incestuous on both sides. What we need is impartial debate for the good of the country.So the SNP gains from its controlling stake in the Yes movement, while the Yes movement is tarnished with the behaviour of the SNP. Thatrsquos the bottom line.This isnrsquot just a post-Mackay and pre-Salmond trial concern ndash this issue has been festering for years and rotting away inside the Scottish body politic.Reporting which holds the SNP Government to account is dismissed as an attempt to hamper the cause of independence. The net result  The SNP dodges proper accountability. If any other another party was in government, such scrutiny would be lauded for holding power to account. Thatrsquos no longer the case among a section of independence supporters. That wounds democracy.Perhaps, the best route out of this democratic dilemma is for an umbrella organisation like the old Yes Scotland to rise from the grave. We need to have a clear iding line between the SNP and the broader Yes movement.The SNP needs to be held to the same set of standards as other parties. It needs voted in and out of office according to its record. Itrsquos now becoming detrimental to good governance for the SNP to be able to continually hide behind independence.Similarly, a Yes movement set apart from the SNP machine, could represent independence without the issue being contaminated by party politics. This is in the best interests of Yes voters ndash of whom, Irsquom one.Why would I want an issue I believe in ndash in this case independence ndash made unnecessarily grubby by a political party  And why would I want the issue I believe in to be used as a shield by a political party ndash in this case the SNP ndash to prevent it being properly held to account Of course, the old Yes Scotland organisation, which shut up shop after the last independence referendum, had plenty of influential SNP members. But it was run by Blair Jenkins, a senior broadcaster not a politician, and Dennis Canavan, a former Labour MP who became an independent MSP.Yes Scotland didnrsquot feel asit were merely an adjunct to the SNP, intended to aid a party political machine. It felt like an organisation arguing for independence in a way that was best for the people of Scotland.This is why the debate around independence has become so toxic. All those old organisations which campaigned in , like Women for Independence or National Collective, represented ordinary folk making their voices heard. They did so mostly without bitterness or rancour.These citizensrsquo organisations operated by trying to win undecideds around with persuasion. Now that the debate around independence has been left to the career politicians itrsquos stagnated into ugliness ndash because thatrsquos what politics is: people are in it for power, money and ego. Thatrsquos not what the Yes movement was ever about, nor what Scotland needs.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11009892.jpg?type=article-full","title":"safer-internet-day---make-going-online-safe-simple-tips","story":"This is an International day celebrated in over  countries with the theme: Together for a better internet.

Mackay. Salmond. Schools. Hospitals. Ferries.This is emphatically not a Government in trouble no party polling consistently above  per cent after  years in Government, and certain to emerge from the next election as the largest party, can credibly be said to be in trouble. But it is a Government enduring a period of policy and internal dficulties the likes of which it has not seen since it replaced Labour as ldquoScotlandrsquos party in .The Scottish Tories are hoping that dficulties turn into crisis, and crisis turns into defeat. They have a vision ndash a hope ndash that the Mackay story, next monthrsquos trial of Mr Salmond, and anything  which emerges now that the media has the scent of sleaze in its nostrils, could create a narrative which might just turn the tide against the SNP.One can be sure that nothing  will. Whilst some Tories see the perceived mounting doubt over the SNPrsquos domestic record as a route to power, most realise that it is nowhere near sufficient to eject them from office. If the SNP is to lose in Mayitrsquoll be a personality issue, not a policy one.What a backdrop for the Scottish Toriesrsquo new leader to take office on Valentinersquos Day, with the top task to avoid a Unionist massacre in just over  months. Barring an upset of Leicester City proportions, that new leader will be Jackson Carlaw.Mr Carlaw is a highly accomplished politician who has acquitted himself well in both of his caretaker stints. He is personable, excellent company in private, and his decency carries into the public sphere, where he treats opponents with a level of respect not entirely replicated across the Parliament. But he has a ruthless streak, as we saw at First Ministerrsquos Questions last Thursday when he went for the First Ministerrsquos jugular on Mr Mackay.He may need that ruthless streak. For he will enter what may quietly but suddenly become the most important year the Scottish Tory Party has had.For whilst the party may be attracted to a campaign based on the perceived policy failings of the SNP, in the real world, and in real politics, there is only one issue at the Holyrood  election, and that is indyref .The Toriesrsquo strategic positioning on a second independence referendum is highly likely to be the key determinant of its success at that election, which would be fine but for one thing they canrsquot agree amongst themselves on what it should be. Not only that, but the positions are becoming so entrenched that I think there is a decent chance agreement will not be found.There are, broadly, two camps letrsquos call them the Ayes and the Noes. They agree one one thing, that the top priority is to stop nationalist parties winning a Holyrood majority. But beyond that, they dfer.The Ayes accept thatthe SNPwin a majority on a clear manesto pledge to agitate for a second referendum, in an election in which everyone understands what they are voting for, then the referendum must be given.They see a persistent refusal to accept the verdict of the Scottish people as a continuation of the failed strategies of the past, whereby London thinks it is ldquowinning by saying no to the SNP, while it is in fact fomenting discord and pushing moderates towards nationalism, repelled by centralisation and a lack of respect for Scotland.More acutely, they see the ldquono to Indyref  strategy as a vote loser. This is counter-intuitive, but with perhaps  per cent of voters committed to voting Conservative, the party is depending on another -or-so per cent of Labour and LibDem-voting Unionists to vote Tory rather than staying put, staying at home, or voting SNP.To attract these people, they need the threat of Indyref  to be on the table. In Decemberrsquos General Election, these Unionists were reassured by Boris Johnsonrsquos guarantee that there would be no Indyref , and accordingly did not feel compelled to vote Tory to stop it. There was no threat, so there was no compulsion. Several MPs lost their seats as a direct consequence.So the Ayes believe that not only is accepting Indyref  after an SNP victory democratically right, it is also electorally smart.But then there are the Noes. The Noes are scarred by the ldquonear miss at the first independence referendum. Although not all accept how poor the  Downing Street campaign was, they know they donrsquot want to do it again. Some are opposed primarily out of a deep pessimism about their chances of winning, but the greater number oppose the concept of Indyref  for the more noble reason that they see the extensive rupture that the issue continues to cause in Scottish politics and in Scottish public le, and they fear a deepening of the ide.They also tend to see the SNP as a party on the way down, and eventually out. They believe thatthey hold firm and create a competent-looking alternative government, the SNP will eventually fizzle out and lose an election, after which the independence issue is dead.They also believe that the ldquono, never strategy gives the SNP more or a problem than it gives them. If the SNP wins a majority in  and the Prime Minister still says no, what is the First Minister to do  She could ldquodo a Catalonia, but everyone knows that she wonrsquot, because she will lose all the international respect and legitimacy which she has worked so hard to build.So, the Noes suppose, the SNP will simply dial up the grievance agenda and double-down on perpetually talking about Indyref . The people will tire, wonrsquot they The fascinating truth of this Tory dilemma is that both the Ayes and the Noes have credible points. Either could be right, in the final analysis.

He was standing outside a hotel in the Highlands that he and his we Alice had recently purchased. ldquoWe sold our flat in London, bought this and still had change, he said, still looking stunned at the bargain.The viewer who had just switched over unawares to Channel  might have thought they had dropped in on some edgy political piece about the economic disparity between London and Scotland. But no. This was the first in a new series, Ben Fogle: Make a New Le in the Country, and the first stop was ldquoglorious Scotland as the presenter described it.ldquoThis is one of my favourite places on Earth, said Fogle. ldquoIrsquove often imagined what it would be like to bring my own family here and open a boutique hotel. Itrsquos the Scottish dream. Not to be confused with the Scottish play, of course.Fogle has a strong connection with Scotland, having taken part in Castaway , the reality show in which a group of strangers tried to start a new community on Taransay. From this he launched what has turned out to be a successful television career. From Countryfile to Crufts,there is a gig involving Barbour jackets and stout boots, Fogle has probably bagged it.Jade and Alice had a starter flat in Croydon, good jobs, two dogs, family and friends nearby, but London le felt like being on a treadmill. Alice, Scottish on her motherrsquos side, had spent many a holiday in Scotland with her grandparents, so north they came to Loch Tummel, ten miles from Pitlochry.With no experience running a hotel it was a bold move to buy a six-bedroom inn that had been empty for two years. The price was pound,, paid for by selling the Croydon flat for pound,. Although they had builders to do the big tasks, everything  was down to them.The story that played out was familiar reality show fare, with the couple going from initial excitement to exhaustion as reality set in. The first nightrsquos restaurant takings were pound.. ldquoOn balance it is a ****load of work for what on the surface looks like not a lot of gain, said Alice.There were the obligatory fraught moments, particularly when Jade tried to give his team of two, Alice and Callum their friend from London, a pep talk which consisted of clichesand portents of doom. ldquoThe worst pep talk in pep talk history, concluded Alice.Daughter of an Army officer, Alice was a practical, get-stuck-in sort. The production had sneaky ways of hinting her family were not short of a bob, as when they filmed her putting up paintings that she had borrowed from her parentsrsquo home, as one does.There was a major flaw in the format in that the programme began in , with Foglersquos visit, then looped back to  when the couple first bought the place.Since we knew from the off that they were still in business there was no sense of jeopardy. Moreover, since one assumes the film crew were not with them for every minute of the three years, there would have been moments that were missed. As Alicersquos mum said, there had been ldquolots of tears.Their biggest problem was attracting staff due to the remoteness of the location. Eight chefs came and went in three years before Alice decided to do the catering herself. You had to hand it to the pair they stuck at it. It had been tough but worth it, and they would not be going back to London.Fogle almost put his finger on it when he said that a beautul landscape and spectacular views were probably not enough on their own to make a success of a hotel.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt. HIE must be properly supported to continue their role in providing an alternative.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That draw will be made at the end of March.Details and updates on the draw can be seen on the Orkney Lucky Locals Facebook page, www.facebook orkneyluckylocals  where it is stated that books containing prize draw numbers for shoppers to fill in, are in the process of being distributed to participating retailers.Ticketyboo would also be keen to hear from any other local businesses in Orkney who are keen to get involved, which they can also do via the Facebook page or by contacting them via email at: info@shearersorkneycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The SNP must realise it#s time for radical change, writes Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.This Scottish Budget is one of the most signicant in years. This year, the Scottish Parliament has the chance to vote for a budget that will deliver the investment Scotland badly needs and bring about real change in our county.In the last few weeks, we have seen the cost of years of mismanagement and timidity. December’s AE waiting times were the worst on record. The number of homelessness deaths in Scotland is rising sharply and the rate is the highest in the UK. Scotland’s schools are slipping down the international rankings and there is to be a full and extensive review of the SNP’s botched implementation of Curriculum for Excellence conducted by the OECD .Unfortunately, while there is so much at stake determining the future of our country, the Derek Mackay scandal has overshadowed much of Thursday’s important debate on the Budget statement. Derek Mackay’s actions are nothing short of predatory and everyone at Scottish Labour sends their support to the schoolboy involved, his family, and the family of Derek Mackay.:Derek Mackay scandal will not bring down SNP - Brian Monteith: SNP urged to ‘remove independence roadblock’ to get budget through HolyroodSuch heinous acts by a man in a position of power and privilege are entirely intolerable. It is right that Derek Mackay has resigned from the Cabinet and it is right that the SNP have removed the whip, but the nature of his actions mean he is not fit to hold public office – he should go and go now.The long-awaited Budget statement, as presented by Kate Forbes on Thursday afternoon, was deeply disappointing. Though not without some positives such as the Scottish Child Payment which I have called for many times, the statement clearly showed the SNP has no intention of breaking with the timidity of the last  years and delivering the investment Scotland badly needs.Yawning financial black holeThat the SNP intends to use its resource-borrowing powers to borrow £ million in order to plug the £ billion financial blackhole is deeply troubling. This is money that must be paid back and the SNP need to come clean with the parliament and the people of Scotland and explain exactly where they intend to make the cuts that would be needed to pay this money back. Throwing good money after bad in order to try to plug the yawning fiscal black hole is not only unworkable, but irresponsible. Scottish Labour is willing to work with the Government, but onlythey commit to free bus travel for under-s that will promote public transport usage and break down barriers to opportunity provide a fair deal for our hard-pressed local authorities and take decisive action in response to the climate crisis.So far, the indication is that the SNP will not commit to free bus travel for under-s nor provide further and higher education with the resources they need after years of under-investment.The Government’s proposals for local authority funding have received deservedly short shrt from councillors and Cosla, whose president, Alison Evison, has said that in reality this Budget means local government faces “a cut to services, a cut to local jobs, a cut to the work councils do to tackle child poverty and respond to climate change”.The Budget as proposed also makes for dire reading on the subject of higher education. After a decade of cuts and neglect, it offers nothing of any substance to Scotland’s universities. Students too, who are now burdened with record levels of debt, have little reason to celebrate this Budget. As the president of the National Union of Students Scotland, Liam McCabe, has said, “Despite the rising cost-of-living, the support on offer to Scotland’s students remains largely unchanged, leaving them increasingly out of pocket and many struggling to get by, especially the most disadvantaged.” Nicola Sturgeon once said “judge me on education”. Well, the NUS have judged her and her Government, and it’s failing marks for the SNP.Tories offer to back SNPThe alternatives to a Scottish Labour-backed budget are either unpalatable or unthinkable. The Scottish Green Party, who have dutully helped pass the last four Scottish Budgets, have rediscovered their environmental zeal and have decided that they cannot back a Budget that has failed to provide a coherent or strong response to the climate crisis and has been described as “… more timid tinkering at the edges” by Friends of the Earth Scotland.The Scottish Tories, who helped pass the SNP’s Budgets between  and , have offered to lend the SNP their support this time around, but on condition that the SNP legislate for lower taxes. The SNP have made it clear that they will not lower taxesand so this scenario, quite apart from the constitutional animus, looks unlikely. The Liberal Democrats have said they will under no circumstances support any Budget proposed by the SNP.The option the SNP has is this: will they join with the Tories in passing a harmful and damaging budget or will they work constructively with Scottish Labour  It doesn’t have to be like this. Over the coming weeks, Scottish Labour will be fighting for the change we want to see and making the case for our transformative policies to the Government. We have a chance to turn the page on years of under-investment and SNP smoke and mirrors. Scottish Labour will fight for our proposals with the courage of our convictions.Our NHS is in crisis, with social care on the brink. Our education system is failing school pupils and leaving students burdened with eye-watering levels of debt. Our planet is on the verge of ecological disaster.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

The line will be open from am – pm Monday to Friday.The contact line is for use by three priority vehicle groups which include four year old cars due their first MOT, taxis and car dealerships. These groups are unable to avail of a Temporary Exemption Certicate being issued to other car and light goods vehicle owners.Speaking as the contact line opens, DVA Chief Executive Paul Duffy said: “DVA is continuing to work to contact priority vehicle owners as quickly as possible, however we do not have contact details for all of these customers.“We are therefore asking anyone with a four year old car due its first MOT, taxis and local car dealerships with vehicles due a test within the next two weeks to contact us on  , so we can move your appointment forward. Please state clearly when the vehicle test is due and have your booking reference to hand. This line will continue to be open to all relevant customers within the priority groups who need an urgent appointment within two weeks from the time of the call. “DVA can only bring an appointment forward after a booking has been made on the system, so it is essential that customers continue to make a booking when they get a reminder letter.”DVA continues to do everything possible to resume normal operations and two new vehicle lts are now in operation in Belfast and Newbuildings, increasing capacity at these sites. Three existing lts in Belfast and Lisburn have been independently inspected and are back in operational use. Two independent reviews announced by the Minister for Infrastructure have also now begun and an initial report in relation to the status of existing vehicle lts and any repair work necessary is due shortly. DVA would like to remind owners of cars of five years and older whose tests have been cancelled by the DVA, that they will automatically receive a Temporary Exemption Certicate , thereby enabling them to continue to drive and tax their vehicle.TECs are also being automatically issued to owners of three year old light goods vehicles. Testing of heavy goods vehicles, buses, motorcycles and re-tests remains unaffected by the current disruption and those customers should continue to attend appointments.Customers should continue to book an MOT when they get their reminder letter. This will ensure that, should DVA need to cancel the test later, a temporary exemption certicate can be issued automatically. Bookings can be made online at www.nidirect.gov.uk services book-motvehicle-test-online by ringing the booking line on    or in person at a Test Centre.The public can get more information at www.nidirect.gov.uk mot-latest  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2740917.jpg--.jpg?1581433158000\n","title":"wrightbus welcomes government plans for 4000 new zero emissions buses","story":" Local bus manufacturer Wrightbus has welcomed the Government’s announcement of their plans for  new zero emissions buses.The company believes that renewed investment in buses is vital to improve communities across the UK and decarbonise the economy.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

The figure emerged as the Health Minister said the sector would require extra funding of £m next year.Robin Swann said there were deep-seated problems across the health and social care system that will take years to put right.Official figures revealed how the Department of Health has turned to the private sector.Such firms are used so patients can be seen sooner and to help health trusts meet targets.In the five years to April last year, the cost topped £,, - equivalent to £, a day on average.The figures were disclosed by Mr Swann after an Assembly question from Jim Allister.Mr Swann said: The HSC utilises the private healthcare sector where in-house capacity is unable to meet demand.However, TUV leader Mr Allister said the spending should be properly scrutinised. Taken in totality, the level of expenditure is very considerable, he said.That is money that should be spent in the public sector, not the private sector. The fact it is going to the private sector shows that there has been too little focus and attention on building up a public health system.A breakdown of spending showed £.m was paid to private companies in  , with a further £.m in  . Expenditure fell to £.m in   and £.m in  . However, in the last year , spending started to rise again and reached £.m.Official figures show Northern Ireland#s waiting lists are continuing to grow. The latest statistics showed the number of people waiting more than  hours in emergency departments had more than doubled in a year - up from , in December  to , in December .Last week this newspaper revealed a patient waited  hours in the casualty unit at Antrim Area Hospital in December.Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association#s Northern Ireland Council, said expenditure on the private health sector was further evidence of the need to transform the health service. These figures are no surprise and are a side effect of years of poor workforce planning and chronic under-investment in the health and social care service, he added.Poor workforce planning leads to over-use of locums, decline in service delivery, stress on existing workforce and long waiting lists - waiting list times that are currently the worst in the UK and growing. The use of private providers to tackle waiting lists is a costly fix to a problem that can only be properly addressed through full-scale transformation, as outlined by Professor Bengoa. That includes implementing the workforce planning strategy and ensuring it is resourced effectively and takes in primary, secondary, community and social care.The Department of Health said: Where health service capacity is insufficient to meet demand for elective services, trusts have been funded non-recurrently to undertake additional activity to further increase the number of patients receiving assessment or treatment. Trusts are expected to maximise in-house capacity in the first instance. However, a proportion of patients will be transferred to private healthcare providers when insufficient capacity is available within the HSC.The HSC has arrangements in place to ensure that the sourcing and procurement of additional capacity is managed efficiently and effectively.On Tuesday Mr Swann said an extra £m would be required compared with this year#s budget just to maintain existing service levels. Meeting commitments on restoring pay parity and improving staffing levels will require another £m.He said the   budget his department receives next month would be crucial.Mr Swann accepted he was requesting a signicant amount of additional money.I very much welcome the priority attached to health by Executive colleagues both in public and in private. We are all facing up to the scale of the challenges in our departments, he said.I certainly owe it to patients and their families to be frank with them.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandHealth service in Northern Ireland needs £m extra, minister saysThe health and social care service in Northern Ireland will require extra funding of £ million next year, the minister has said.Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland GP reveals children as young as nine being referred to mental health services A Northern Ireland GP has revealed he is referring children as young as nine to mental health services.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most Read#Miserable# week of weather ahead for Northern Ireland with more snowLegal firm Carson McDowell recruits th solicitor in Northern IrelandJamie Bryson wants DUP chief Johnston as NAMA trial defence witnessCouple ‘living the dream’ after tying the knot in NI’s first same-sex marriageNorthern Ireland could be in dferent time zone to GB after Brexit,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The most recent Performance Improvement Report, issued in November, indicates that the Council has not performed to the standards expected or addressed the serious issues confronting it. Information from the Northern Ireland Audit Office has confirmed Causeway Coast and Glens is performing well below the other  councils.“This cannot be ignored by elected representatives and this is why we called for the appointment of independent consultants to examine root and branch the senior workings of this council.They continued: “As elected representatives, we are required to adhere to a code of conduct based on the  principles of public le. Principally, we are servants of the public and stewards of public resources.We have a moral responsibility to our constituents to take control of the situation, to correct it and to ensure that it does not happen again. We also have an obligation to demand openness and transparency.The SDLP group concluded: “The harsh reality is that this Council is at financial breaking point and is quickly losing the trust ofthe public. This huge debt is seen by an increasing number of people as poor management and we need to recty that.“We are delighted that our motion was passed to call in independent experts to meticulously detail what the problems are and more importantly, what the long-term solutions are. Only then will it be able to regain the public’s confidence”.A motion, proposed by Sinn Feacutein Councillor Cara McShane on the appointment of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancyinto Causeway Coast and Glens was also passed on Tuesday.The council agreed to appoint CIPFA and to defer any decision on rates ahead of the legal timeframe of  February.They said this was to allow CIPFA to make recommendations, report to members and work with council to prepare a medium term financial plan and financial resilience review. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a great era.You had to go out that was the only way to meet up, you couldnt bring a girl round to the house.Youd have to go to the pictures or go for a walk.The smitten couple went to great s to see each other because Mr Boyle lived in Lishally while his sweetheart was from the city.We walked everywhere so we used to go out with our dancing shoes under our arm, said Mrs Boyle.Very few people had cars and a night out could involve all manner of transport, especiallyyou were going to Borderland in Muff.Myra got the bus to Enagh Lough and I would walk her in to the Red Cross Bar and then we would get the boat across from Lisahally to Culmore and then walk from Culmore out to Borderland, said Mr Boyle. googletag.cmd.push Jimrefused to let living out in Lisahally get in the way of his social le.I used to stick my galoshes [waterproof shoes] in a hedge and pick them up on the way home, he recalled.I got a lt on a motorbike a few times and I went on the back of lorries with pigs in them.It could be scary walking down the Lough Road at night because it was pitch black.I used to say youll never see anybody as long as you walk backwards.You had to know every street in Derry too.Becauseyou offered to walk a girl home you had to know how far it was going to be.The Derry girls were well known for their sense of style and were always impeccably dressed.They were always very well turned out, said Mr Boyle.The Derry ladies were always dressed up.Especially at the Embassy. Even the bouncers at the Embassy wore a tabby bow.Thats the only thing that has changed is the dress, said Mr Boyle.In those days you wouldnt have got in without a collar and a tie.You had to get all dressed up and the bands would be all dressed up too.There was no turning up in jeans and a oul top.You used to see the girls walking around on a Friday with their curlers in.Sometimesthey asked you out they would say no, Im washing my hair.That was a handy way of refusing.Dancing was a big thing for people of all ages in the city and most of them were self taught.You might have had an older sister who would show you the steps, or you would teach yourself pushing off a door handle, said Mr Boyle.Mr and Mrs Boyle both recall the excuse me dances where someone could cut in and take your partner.It was mostly your mates who would cut in, Jim recalled.You had to rescind to them and give them your lady friend.There were strict rules about the style of dancing too and how close you could get to your partner.You werent allowed to jive unless it was a jive session, and you couldnt dance too close to your partner, said Mrs Boyle.The parish priest would come along and tap you on the shoulderhe thought you were too close, whether you were married or not.A girl could get a tap too. I remember getting one at the Whitehorse when we were married.And the couple, who have been wed for  years, have no intention of hanging up their dancing shoes any time yet.We cant stop now we would seize up, joked Mrs Boyle.Its much better than sitting in the house, agreed Mr Boyle. The doctor should put it on prescription, dancing gets you out and exercising and talking to people. googletag.cmd.push If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the second half we werent clinical enough. We should have been finishing that game with -, - at our ease. googletag.cmd.push “We played much better last week than we did this week. Its old school tradition but I felt we didnt get enough blocks on last week, we didnt put enough pressure on the ball going in and today we did that much better and thats probably resulted in Tipp being held scoreless from play.”Gallagher admitted that the uncertainty in the build up to the game was not at all helpful, with the Derry boss expecting the game to be postponed after witnessing the rain at Celtic Park on Saturday night.“In the morning we probably felt that it wasnt going to be on,” he said. “It was a bit of a lottery and you could see the way it cut up there. To be brutally honest I stayed up last night and witnessed the rain. “We were up at the Brunswick and the kids were coming out and it was absolutely baltic and the rain was coming in.“In fairness the pitch improved and to be fair thats part of the challenge of being a sportsman or athlete because you have got to be mentally strong and to be fair the lads started the game strong and that didnt seem to impact them.”Yesterdays game was certainly not the most entertaining nor memorable of games, but for Gallagher and his players it was all about the result.“When it was -, - you would like to have seen us push on but to be honest I thought there were one or two soft frees again,” he continued. “We didnt push on but we overplayed the ball and dropped a couple short and maybe Alex had a couple of shots we missed and we had Sammysgoal chance and we had Dannyschance.“Those things, maybe instead of stretching the game out to -, or  or  points maybe leaves it a wee bit more nervy than it should but I suppose the boys are saying that we havent beaten a team ranked like Tipperary in a couple of years so it probably leads to a wee bit of fear.” googletag.cmd.push Important After disappointments of ious natures against Leitrim and Down, yesterdays win was important for Derry in the short term as well as in the bigger picture.“We need to have an open mind,” Gallagher continued. “We want to be better at the end of the league than we were at the start. Thats the approach we have taken because we are with a new group and we are trying to build a consistency here.“Im not from Derry but looking in from the outside the turnover in players, the in and out of the squad, the lack of consistency in selection, the lack of togetherness probably, were really trying to build on that.“We think the age of the squad is really, really good there and we know theres good talent thats come through in Derry but its a matter now of sticking together. Its a test of character and generally the people who are mentally toughest and the strongest characters win out.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Leo Doherty, an Upper-Sixth pupil at Lumen Christi College, has won first prize in the Intermediate Category of the British Council’s Mandarin Speaking Competition, which was held at the Victory Service Club last Wednesday. His win follows on from that of Thornhill Colleges Eve Flood, who took the beginners’ title last year. The competition aims to build interest in Chinese language and culture and saw Leo joined by students from  Secondary Schools from across the Britain – including fellow pupilsAnitta Sibin, who competed in the Beginners’ Category, andMatthew Rodgers, Niamh Fleming, Grace Martin, Vibhav Nthanankalva and Owen McFadden, who performed in the Group category. googletag.cmd.push The Lumen Christi pupils made it through to the final after competing in the Northern Ireland heat last November which was supported by the Confucius Institute at Ulster University. Leo, who has only been learning Mandarin for two years, said it was surreal to have won. “I’ve always loved linguistics and with Mandarin, it changes the way you think about languages – it’s almost like a problem to be solved. I also like that you can watch dferent TV, listen to Chinese music and communicate with people across the world. “I was shocked when I won. There were so many good competitors and I didn’t expect to come away with anything. I was just there for the experience, and it wasn’t really about the winning so to speak –it still feels very surreal. googletag.cmd.push “My teacher XU Honge helped me prepare - giving me lots of tips and tricks ahead of the competition as well as showing me how to manipulate the language. It was definitely a lot more work than I originally thought, but well worth it!” He now plans to study Maths at either Cambridge University or St Andrew’s. “At university I plan to study Maths as it’s just something I enjoy and hopefully it will take me into some job I like. I aim to keep learning Mandarin as I think it will be useful – you see jobs in London, Dublin and even Derry where they need people that can speak Mandarin and communicate with people in China.” Dr Marie Ferris, Vice Principal at Lumen Christi Collegesaid: “We’re just so tremendously proud of Leo, as well as the rest of our finalists. It’s a great achievement for all of them – they were very professional and performed at such a high level, especially considering the competition they had to face. “I must pay tribute to their Mandarin teachers from the Confucius Institute, who have worked so hard with them. As a school, we have been part of the Confucius project since  and it’s created so many opportunities for our pupils, helping them learn more about Chinese language and culture.” As the most spoken language in the world, Mandarin is recognised as a valuable skill for young people in the UK to acquire.  per cent of British business leaders surveyed in  said that speaking Mandarin will give school leavers a career advantage. Research by the British Council has found that Mandarin is the second most important foreign language for the UK’s influence on the global stage.Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland commended Leos achievement. He said: “Congratulations to Leo on such a fantastic achievement, which is testament to the hard work he and his teachers have put in throughout the past year. We hope that Leo is an inspiration to other students to think about learning Mandarin or finding out more about Chinese language and culture. “Language learning is an essential part of understanding and collaborating with other countries and cultures. With more than one billion Mandarin speakers in the world, it’s important that more young people in the UK learn the language – those that do will find it opens up exciting study and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world. “In the British Council we have a wide range of opportunities and resources available to support schools who are keen to get more involved in international work and would encourage other schools to get in touch with us to see how we can support their international ambitions.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved.

I would just like to thank Air Ambulance NI for all that they have done for me.Her mum explained that she desperately tried to avoid the collision.ldquoI saw her in the last two or three secondshellip and I tried to drive into the hedge but a telegraph pole stopped me and Ellie hit the front of my vehicle with the quad, she recalled.The sound of the collision has left an indelible mark on her.Kerry Anderson, head of fundraising for Air Ambulance NI, said the organisation is so glad to hear that Ellie is making such great strides in her recovery and that the medical team was able to provide her with the urgent medical care she needed.ldquoAir Ambulance NI is a vital service that depends on public donations, Kerry explained.ldquoIt costs pound, per day to keep our helicopter in the sky and accidents like this prove how important that is.The air ambulance operates seven days a week for  hours and since its first mission in July , it has responded to to more than , call-outs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Sofley.jpg","title":"Sofley doubles up for Saintfield aces as Rec get the boot  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United welcomed Wellington Rec to Pigeon Hill on a breezy afternoon, looking to build on a run of strong performances.Neither team gave anything away in the early exchanges and it took a moment of magic from James Sofley to break the deadlock, as he cut in from the right onto his left foot and fired a thunderbolt into the top corner.This gave the hosts a lt as they were well on top for the next  minutes, but they failed to capitalise with another goal.A sloppy ending to the half from both teams meant that the scoreline remained - at the break.The second half began with the visitors pushing to get onto level terms and they were nearly rewarded with Harper being called into action to make a smart save low to his left.Minutes later he was beaten, but the ball struck the crossbar.

He was in his early s.He was held in high regard by not only his party colleagues, but members of all the main political parties and a politician who was often sounded out for his advice and wise counsel on local authority business.A founder member of the SDLP in South Down, Mr Doris is also credited with playing a critical role in Eddie McGradyrsquos Westminster success in  when the nationalist party finally wrestled the seat from Ulster Unionist Enoch Powell. The former SDLP councillor was Mr McGradyrsquos election agent.Mr Doris joined the former Downpatrick Urban District Council and was re-elected to Down Council in  and served as the districtrsquos first citizen in  .He retained his seat during several council elections and retired from the council when it formally went out of business in  when it merged with its neighbour in Newry and Mourne to become one of  new super councils.Tributes to Mr Doris have been paid by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, South Down MLA Colin McGrath, former South Down MP Baroness Margaret Ritchie and fomer council colleague Dermot Curran.Tributes have also been paid by Rowallane DUP councillor Billy Walker and UUPrsquos Robert Burgess.Mr Eastwood paid tribute to the le and legacy of Mr Doris whom he described as an ldquoSDLP stalwart and founding party member.ldquoJohn lived his le in service of others, continued the party leader.ldquoHe had a deep passion for his community of Downpatrick, which he represented with dignity for many years, as councillor and Down Council chairman. John was also the election agent for former South Down MP Eddie McGrady and played a key role in the seismic election in which Eddie unseated Enoch Powell.Mr Eastwood said in addition to his love for his community and constituents, Mr Doris was ldquodeeply committed to the aims and values of the SDLP, working towards peace, social justice and civil rights throughout his le.ldquoJohn was a shining light in some of the darkest days. Even after his retirement, he remained a loyal SDLP member and provided wise counsel to the new generation stepping forward in South Down and across the North, said the party leader.ldquoI want to express my deepest sympathies to Johnrsquos we Mairead, his children and the whole Doris family. In this very sad time, I hope they find the admiration of Johnrsquos friends and colleagues of some comfort to them.Mr McGrath said his friend and former party colleague epitomised the term ldquogentleman.The Assemblyman described Mr Doris as a ldquogentle giant of politics and someone who took him under his wing, teaching him the ropes of being a good councillor.ldquoJohn was also a successful businessman in Downpatrick but never lost his social justice roots and always did what he could to help people, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHis quiet way and manner often won out and he delivered for people on the matters that meant most to them. He was there for people in their hour of need. I offer my sympathies to Mairead and his family at this time.Cllr Curran described Mr Doris as man who had the interests of his local community very much at heart. He said his friend put the people of Downpatrick at the top of his agenda and fought valiantly for them on a range of issues, not least, social justice.ldquoJohn was proud of his roots and Downpatrick was coursing through his veins. He was my colleague and friend and he will be sadly missed by a great many people. My sympathies are very much with his we Mairead and the family circle. Downpatrick and indeed the wider district has lost a great man who was held in high regard by all those who knew him, said Cllr Curran.He added: ldquoJohn and I were very close and had many conversations over the years about a great many things. I and many others from all walks of le will miss him very much. As far as John was concerned, people always came first.Cllr Walker described Mr Doris as a ldquogentleman and explained their paths first crossed in  when he was elected to the council.ldquoJohn was a man for whom I had the utmost respect. In all the years we served on Down Council I never once heard him say a cross word abut anyone and he never brought sectarian politics into the chamber.ldquoHe was a councillor for the people and I was very saddened to learn of his passing. My thoughts are with his we and family. The thoughts and prayers of many people are with them at this terribly sad time, added Cllr Walker.Rowallane Ulster Unionist councillor, Robert Burgess, said he will always remember attending his first council meeting when Mr Doris introduced himself.ldquoI had nothing but the highest respect for John. He was a man of integrity and while we may have dfered politically I regarded him as a friend and a man who had the interests of Downpatrick and indeed the wider district at heart, he said.ldquoJohn was an absolute gentleman and was someome whom I held in the highest regard.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18215389.birney-returns-sundance-new-documentary/resources/images/10992265.jpg","title":"bandstand paddy mulligan","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The mainbenefits of a bridge are:• a boost to Northern Ireland to Great Britain and GB-NI trade as transport costs would come down • the value of time saved , and • increased interaction between businesses in, say, Belfast and central ScotlandEven on the most optimistic of assumptions,one combines the sums of money in terms of benefits it will be less than the possible cost— £ billion or even £bn.None of this says for sure ‘do not build’— and it is worth pointing out that a bridge would help the regional economy in what is one of the poorest parts of Scotland, the South West.But it is indicative that a small amount of that project budget spent in other waysmight well yield greater s.• Dr Esmond Birnie is senior economist at the University of Ulster©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers. This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

The pupils were then asked to redesign the maps by using their knowledge of the local area.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid.

It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
