And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But using his skills to work as a mortuary technician was an experience that had a profound impact“If it was my mum, grandma or son, I’d want someone looking after them”, says ex-Royal Marine commando, Sam Murray, who in April found himself volunteering as a mortuary technician, in response to the strain key workers suddenly faced. Having served in the marines from 1988 through to 1996, Murray had spotted a plea for help from fellow former marine Richard Sharp on social media. As CEO of charity Re:Act Disaster Response (formerly Team Rubicon UK), Sharp had requested military veterans urgently lend their skills to the crisis, which Murray says he was eager to do.“When Covid-19 was starting, I could see it all unfolding and wanted to help,” he says. “I thought: ‘I can’t just sit here, I need to do something.’ I saw they needed veteran volunteers, so I rang Richard up and said: ‘Right, get me involved.’” It meant Murray was given the daunting task of selecting, training and heading up a team of 12 veteran volunteers to work as mortuary technicians for five weeks. Stationing the teams across two hospital mortuaries in the north-west, Murray worked across both for three weeks. What he saw changed his life.Tasked with handling the deceased before taking measurements for their coffins,the volume of work the technicians faced was staggering, he says. “In a normal 24-hour period in hospital you’d have one or two deaths occurring – not including people arriving in ambulances. At the spike, they were receiving 20 a day, sometimes more. I can’t imagine how the technicians did it before we got there.”Any discomfort Murray initially felt was quickly put into perspective. “At first it was horrible and one guy had to leave because he didn’t like it, understandably. Then I thought: ‘Well someone’s got to do it.’” But having previously suffered from depression and PTSD, friends questioned whether the role was a good fit. “People were asking me if it would be good for my mental health and I thought: ‘Well, it is, because I’m doing something.’ If the bodies had suspected covid, we’d put them into sealed coffins, which meant families didn’t even get to see them. I kept thinking: ‘I’m the last person who’s going to see them’, which gave me a sense of purpose and duty, like I was doing something worthwhile. It felt like I was helping my country, really, just as I did in the marines. At least I could make sure they were looked after.”Murray is one of a growing number of veterans who have lent their support during the Covid-19 pandemic. As Johnny Mercer, minister for defence, people and veterans, says: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”To date, Re:Act has deployed more than 200 volunteers and has helped to ensure 2,700 deceased patients have been cared for, 1,000 hospital beds have been installed and 5.4m PPE items distributed.Now Murray wants to share his experience so we can learn from it. “People need to know that Covid-19 kills people and if you don’t act sensibly, it’s going to happen again. I can see people out and about already forgetting and it can be frustrating when you’ve seen what I’ve seen,” he says.He is passionate about ensuring the work of the mortuary technicians – like the doctors, nurses and supermarket workers before them – is talked about. “Those technicians were on their own before we arrived. I dedicate everything I do to them, they were absolutely amazing, brave and cheerful. That’s the commando ethos – cheerfulness in the face of adversity. They’re incredibly brave, doing a job nobody wants to do.”But while many veterans are volunteering for the first time, Murray is no stranger to this work. After leaving the marines – where he specialised in Arctic warfare – he turned to security and close protection services, running his own surveillance business until last year. “It was a horrible world, but one of the last jobs I did was for an animal rights company,” he explains. “I remember thinking: ‘I’m doing something worthwhile – I’m helping animals and using my skills.’’’ It led Murray to change tack completely, leaving behind his successful business. “I thought: ‘I can’t go back to that world, I’m going to do good,’” he says.Having suffered from poor mental health after leaving the marines, Murray explains he attempted to take his own life five years ago. It meant he was put in touch with armed forces charity Rock2Recovery, which sparked a friendship with Dan Elliot. “I went to hospital and they helped me get back on my feet,” he says. “I formed a friendship with Dan, who is an amazing guy. You can’t put a finger on how many lives that man has saved. I’ve lost four close friends to suicide in the past four years and I’ve been in hospital in various states of PTSD or depression, whatever you want to call it,” he says.Murray’s involvement with the charity – and his friendship with Elliot – opened his eyes to the volume of military and blue light workers also suffering from poor mental health. Now in a stable, healthy place, Murray devotes his time to connecting withthese workers via social media, where he shares videos about his experiences. “There are thousands of people who want help,” he says. “I tell them about my problems and we speak for hours – they’ll call me at night to talk. Many of them have never opened up to anyone before.”They meet in person, too. Having discovered the Wim Hof method – which combines cold-water exposure, breathing techniques and meditation, and Murray credits with saving his life – he invites veterans and those still serving to visit his home in the Peak District, sharing the vital skills and techniques. “They drive hundreds of miles and I take them to the river and we do Wim Hof breathing and jump in the river,” he says. “I’ve had lads and girls saying: ‘You’ve saved my life.’ I think it shows young people that suicide is not the answer and that you can come through the other side. I’m starting to live my life now and I’ve never felt so alive. It saved me, so I teach it.”While his role in the mortuaries has come to an end, Murray is still volunteering with Re:Act, with his latest job safely housing homeless people in nearby St Helens. “I believe this is what I was supposed to do – helping people. It’s my calling”, he says, when asked why he’s doing it. “I think by doing good things and by volunteering, it helps them and it helps me. I also hope that by teaching – and showing people through doing – that they might volunteer more. I’m confident we’ll find positives during this terrible time.”Next, Murray plans to buy a camper van to travel throughout Britain, visiting members of the armed forces, blue light workers and now, mortuary technicians too, to further spread his message and teach the breathing techniques he practises daily. His hope for the country is simple: “During Covid-19, I noticed we’re a community and everyone was looking after the vulnerable and the elderly, which was great but we should be doing that anyway. My message? To keep that going and get people to be kinder, that’s all I’m trying to do.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

In 2018, 178mm fell. In 2019, only 127mm fell.So far in 2020, Wild says more than 500mm has fallen on the cattle and wheat property.Photographs Wild took in December 2019 and then again in March 2020 show the area escape from a moonscape of rocks, dust and dry creek beds.“It was probably the longest prolonged dry period in recorded history. We really did get to a dire situation with a lot of these townships looking at day zero and not knowing what was going to happen.”Merenele is now run by a caretaker with Benjamin’s father John, 71, and mother Vicky, 70, living in the nearby township of Warren.Benjamin Wild, an occupational therapist and poet, lives in Lismore, but goes back regularly to Merenele.“I had a really strong affinity with nature growing up,” Wild says. “I was very much attuned to it. I used to collect seeds and rocks and fill up my drawers with all the junk I found.”Benjamin was born and raised on the farm with his two older sisters Julia and Kate, and older brother Tom.“It was just a state of freedom but, on reflection, it’s growing up in a workplace. Mum and dad were always around and I’d be out shooting or doing farm work. It becomes ingrained in you.”In a good year, the farm now runs more than 400 Shorthorn Charolais cross cows but by December 2019 as Benjamin returned for Christmas, they had de-stocked to 50.He remembers taking a picture as he entered one of the property’s main grazing paddocks, with a cow in the foreground.“That was a horrible day – hot and windy. We were out feeding all day and it was filthy. It would blow a dog off a chain,” he says.“That day showed just how bad it could get. Dad has been out there all his life and it’s rare that the ground gets stripped back to the bone.”The farm faced a bill of about $10,000 every six weeks just to feed the cattle.“The biggest commitment is just keeping everything alive,” Benjamin says.Wild’s photographs show the paddocks returning to life, and the creeks and rivers of the property and other spots close by filling with rain.Marthaguy Creek that forms the eastern boundary of the property was a place Wild watched black cockatoos and water rats play. He doesn’t see those anymore.“The saddest thing has been the numbers of tree deaths over recent years. That stands out for me.”Wild says the region has always had variable weather – with cycles of wet and dry – but he feels something has changed.“I feel like a tourist in my own town because I go back and see these extreme changes. It would always get to 38 or 40 degrees (centigrade) in the late summer, but recently it’s been getting up into the 45s and 47s for extended periods.“I hear the climate change denial in people, and I ask them when was the last time the Arctic and Antarctic was melting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8e7011fc9799d245c06176a5ac98c515cff672/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec6223632efd470b6a3a76a838913633","title":"national gallery exile lockdown coronavirus visitor londn","story":"Director unveils coronavirus measures and says visitors can ‘linger’ at London venueAfter the longest closure in its 196-year history, the National Gallery in London will reopen to visitors on 8 July with three one-way art routes of about 25 to 35 minutes through the collections and a promise that people will be allowed to linger.The gallery will be the first big museum to open in England after the government announced it was easing the lockdown from 4 July.Its director, Gabriele Finaldi, said it felt like the gallery was coming “out of exile” after 111 days of closure. During the second world war it was shut for only two days.“All of us at the National Gallery felt a responsibility of reopening as soon as we could. The tradition here is one of resilience, staying open through the war years and so on, so we felt the weight of that responsibility and we wanted to be there for the visiting public as soon as we possibly could.”It will reopen seven days a week with all visitors having to book time slots online. Once at the gallery they can walk through the collection on one of three routes.Route A will take visitors from the Wilton Diptych medieval panel painting via Michelangelo to Raphael route B from Rubens via Caravaggio to Van Gogh and route C from Bronzino via Hogarth to Van Gogh.Finaldi said the routes had been given approximate timings of 25 to 35 minutes but they will not be compulsory. “People will of course be allowed to linger … we want people to feel they can visit the gallery freely.” If a room gets busy staff may ask people to move on.Visitors will be encouraged to wear face coverings and the distancing will be 2 metres. There will also be high-efficiency filters in the air conditioning, perspex panels at visitor desks, enhanced cleaning and hand sanitisers. Toilets will be one in, one out.Finaldi said it was “hugely exciting” to be reopening and symbolic to be first.“We want to be a part of the nation’s recovery story and by opening the doors and letting the public back in to see our inspiring pictures, we want to make an important contribution to the process,” he said. “We are the same gallery you know and love, just with added social distancing and one-way art routes.”How keen people would be to return to galleries remained an unknown, Finaldi said. He pointed to the example of the politan Museum in New York, where it took five years after 911 for numbers to return to normal.Visitors were going to see some changes in the gallery, Finaldi said, including the reopening of its largest room, which houses Italian Baroque paintings, after a two-year restoration.Van Dyck’s monumental Equestrian Portrait of Charles I will be back on show in Room 21 after more than two years, following conservation work.The gallery’s Titian: Love, Desire, Death exhibition, which closed after only three days, will also reopen and has been extended until 17 January 2021.Tate announced it would reopen its four galleries: Tate Modern, Tate Britain, Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool, on 27 July.Maria Balshaw, the Tate’s director, said: “Art and culture play vital roles in our lives, and many of us have been craving that irreplaceable feeling of being face-to-face with a great work of art.“Our top priority remains that everyone stays safe and well, so we will continue to monitor the situation in the weeks ahead, work closely with government and colleagues, and make all the changes necessary for a safe reopening.”The Royal Academy of Arts will open for “friends” on 9 July and the public on 16 July with its Picasso and Paper exhibition extended until 2 August. Face coverings will be compulsory.Axel Rüger, the RA’s chief executive, said that with a greatly reduced visitor capacity “it will be an opportunity for a quieter, more contemplative experience in the galleries”.The Barbican art gallery will reopen on 13 July, the Whitechapel gallery on 14 July, Turner Contemporary in Margate on 22 July, Nottingham Contemporary on 4 August and the Baltic in Gateshead on 13 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db94fc5b291121ce5a6315094cbb381501baae8e/0_159_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=158db5d4cb876047da706068477708d4","title":"reading group which black british author should we read in july","story":"From the 18th century to the current crop of chart-topping bestsellers, there is a wealth of black British authors to choose from in this month’s reading groupAmong all the many astonishing things that happened in June, two black British authors topped the UK bestseller charts for the first time. Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other took the No 1 spot on the fiction paperback list, while Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race became the first to top both the non-fiction paperback chart and overall charts since records began. But, as Evaristo pointed out, the “astonishing” thing isn’t that these talented writers should outsell everyone else for a week – it’s that they are the first.Before Evaristo, the only black author to top the fiction paperback charts was Jamaican Booker winner Marlon James in 2015, while the only black author to top the overall bestseller charts before Eddo-Lodge was Michelle Obama, for her memoir, in 2018. As Eddo-Lodge said, it is “a horrible indictment of the publishing industry” that it has taken so long unsurprisingly, there is a coordinated campaign to improve this situation, with more than 100 authors joining the Black Writers Guild to get UK publishers “to introduce sweeping reforms to make the overwhelmingly white industry more inclusive at all levels”.The letter they sent to spur UK publishers to support black literary communities feels like a good starting point for this month’s reading group. Not least because so many fine writers signed it, including – to give just a few names – Candice Carty-Williams, Dorothy Koomson, Courttia Newland, David Olusoga and Irenosen Okojie. You can get the full list here (scroll down) – we’d welcome nominations for books by any of these authors.But, of course, that’s nothing like the full story of black British writing. Black authors have been an essential, and undervalued, part of UK literature at least since the publication of Ignatius Sancho’s astonishing letters in 1782 and The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano in 1789. There have been female narratives since The History of Mary Prince was published in 1831. This story of a slave born in Bermuda was transcribed by the writer Susanna Moodie, but it wasn’t too long before self-penned classics like The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands (published in 1857) were in circulation.More recently, there’s been the influx of talent brought in with the Windrush in 1948, and 20th century giants like Sam Selvon, CLR James and ER Braithwaite. As for contemporary names, we have authors such as Evaristo, Helen Oyeyemi, Michael Donkor, Aminatta Forna, Caryl Phillips and Diana Evans to consider. If you need inspiration, there’s an interesting list of black British book recommendations on Shondaland, on AnOther, on the UK Black History Month website, and of course, a list of authors on Wikipedia.All you have to do is to choose the book you’d most like to read by a black British author and nominate it in the comments below. I’ll put the nominations in a hat towards the end of the week and the one that comes out will be our book for July.

Instead, it wanted to “start a conversation” and create more transparency about where people’s money was being invested, what their options were, and what action funds were taking to help tackle the climate crisis.Curtis, who was also responsible for hit films including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bean, started up Comic Relief – which has raised more than £1bn for projects in Africa and the UK – after visiting Ethiopia during the 1985 famine. Now he has co-founded Make My Money Matter, whose partners include conservation organisation WWF, and among those taking part in its launch are Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN special envoy for climate and finance.This is not the first campaign of this type – 2012 saw the launch in the UK of Move Your Money, which was born out of the Occupy Wall Street movement. However, that focused more on the banking system.However, some funds and organisations have been taking action recently – earlier this month the Universities Superannuation Scheme, the UK’s largest private pension scheme by assets, announced plans to stop investing in companies involved with tobacco, thermal coal and certain weapons.“Moving your savings to sustainable funds can be 27 times as effective at reducing your carbon footprint than eating less meat, using public transport, reducing water use, and flying less combined,” said the campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7640a0803dca9fc9407a733a65ed78c2147da0c7/0_267_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811ba09e01aecc0d32904e0b6c9c89c3","title":"global markets best quarter in a decade china factories uk economy gdp business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as BoE chief economist says Covid-19 recovery is underwayMore jobs gloom. UK pilots union BALPA has revealed that easyJet is proposing to cut one in three pilots.Balpa was told today by easyjet that 727 of their pilots are at risk of redundancy, or almost a third of the roster. The budget airline is also proposing to completely close its bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports, Balpa adds.Brian Strutton, BALPA General Secretary, says the scale of the planned cuts are a shock. The union is also unhappy that easyJet paid out £174m in idends to shareholders back in March, even as it was seeking government help.“We know that aviation is in the midst of the COVID crisis and we had been expecting easyJet to make an announcement of temporary measures to help the airline through to recovery. “But this seems an excessive over-reaction and easyJet won’t find a supply of pilots waiting to come back when the recovery takes place over the next two years. easyJet paid £174m out to shareholders, got agreements to furlough staff to protect cash, got £600m from the Government, has boasted of having £2.4bn in liquidity, and ticket sales are going through the roof so fast they cannot get pilots back off furlough quickly enough – so why the panic? It doesn’t add up. We are meeting easyJet today and we will be fighting to save every single job. There’s some scepticism in the economics community about Andy Haldane’s claim that a V-shaped recovery is on the cards.Geriant Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University, points out that a surge in Covid-19 cases, either nationally or at local hot spots, could derail growth.Former MPC member David Blanchflower also sounds unconvinced:Wall Street has made an underwhelming start to the final trading day of the quarter (and what a quarter it was!).That means both indices are still on track to post their best quarterly gains since 1998.The coronavirus pandemic has already had a very severe impact on workers around the globe - with women worst affected.That’s the equivalent of 400m full-time jobs, worse than the ILO previously expected.And with female workers more at risk, modest progress in workplace gender equality is being undermined, as my colleague Larry Elliott explains:The ILO added that women were also more likely to be employed in the domestic work and health and social care work sectors, where there was a greater risk of job losses and infection. The pre-pandemic unequal distribution of unpaid care work had also worsened during the crisis, exacerbated by the closure of schools and care services.The Harveys furniture chain has gone into administration, the latest in a series of UK retail casualties.Some 240 jobs have definitely been lost, and another 1,300 are at risk if administrators can’t find a buyer for the company.My colleagues Sarah Butler and Zoe Wood have the details:All its stores will continue to trade for now, but industry watchers believe a buyer is unlikely to be found. The retailer has been struggling for years and is also heavily reliant on sister chain Bensons for Beds with which it shares several sites.Bensons was also put into administration on Tuesday, but has been bought out in a pre-arranged deal by its private equity owner Alteri Investors, with the aim of saving between 150 and 175 of the chain’s 242 stores, its Huntingdon manufacturing operation and nearly 1,900 jobs.The Canadian economy has suffered its biggest ever monthly contraction.And while the worst may be over, the road to recover will be long and bumpy. Statistics Canada says its initial flash estimate for May points to growth of 3.0 per cent, so not the V-shaped recovery policymakers are hoping for.Andy Haldane’s claim that the UK economy is recovering faster than expected hasn’t cheered the City much.Traders seem to be taking their lead from Wall Street, where the US market is being called lower. Concerns over rising Covid-19 cases may be overshadowing economic optimism (market sentiment has been swinging between these two points for several weeks now).But this shouldn’t stop the FTSE posting its best quarter in a decade, while the US S\u0026ampP 500 is on track for its best quarter in over 20 years.In a blow to film fans, the UK’s largest chain of cinemas has pushed back its scheduled reopening date by three weeks.Cineworld is delaying its reopening until the end of July, rather than the 10th, due to delays in getting hold of new titles.My colleague Catherine Shoard explains that cinema bosses are under pressure to ensure patrons comply with rules to prevent the spread of Covid-19:Both AMC and Cineworld have outlined plans for new safety, hygiene and cleaning protocols on their premises. A backlash to the news that patrons would not be required nor encouraged to wear face coverings prompted U-turns from both companies, with all AMC venues and Regal cinemas now making masks mandatory.However, no such requirement is currently in place at any UK cinema. The Cineworld Action Group, which represents staff at the chain, recently launched a petition in which they called for such a measure to be introduced.Andy Haldane’s comments are timely - a few minutes ago, Boris Johnson announced plans to boost infrastructure spending to help “level up” the UK and limit the damage caused by the recession.An upbeat-sounding Johnson pledged £5bn for infrastructure spending, plus reforms to the planning rules to speed up home-building an extensions, and to help builders convert commercial properties to homes. “We must work fast, because we’ve already seen the vertiginous drop in GDP, and we know that people are worried about their jobs and their businesses.“And we’re waiting as if between the flash of lightning and the thunderclap, with our hearts in our mouths, for the full economic reverberations to appear.”As Alan Custis, Head of UK Equities at Lazard Asset Management, puts it:“We would not expect these comments to amount to much from a market standpoint.Whilst encouraging that we are not going back to the austerity approach that has been the hallmark of the last 10 years, the amounts being talked about are really not of a scale that the economy needs to get it moving and avoid an unemployment cliff as furloughing comes to an end. Andy Haldane has also warned that the Covid-19 pandemic could drive up Britain’s ‘natural rate of unemployment’.Reuters has the details:The depth of the recession was likely to exacerbate any long-term damage to the labour market which could push up Britain’s natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU), Haldane said.A higher NAIRU means an economy is more likely to overheat and generate inflation as the labour market strengthens.Historically, pandemics have not tended to have a persistent upward impact on prices. But a higher NAIRU would be one reason to be cautious before jumping to that conclusion,” Haldane said.

I do everything I can to lull myself into a sedative state: drink chamomile tea, wear an eye mask, take melatonin. Above all, I fight the urge to check my phone. Because as my day ends in London, morning begins in Hong Kong – and at a certain point, I won’t be able to keep from checking the endless news updates from back home a sort of masochistic ritual that has become second nature after a year of following the city’s protests from afar.Last night, sleep was impossible. Beijing has just passed a sweeping national security law that will criminalise “secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign or external forces”, drastically curbing dissent in Hong Kong. The legislation – which allows mainland Chinese officials to operate in Hong Kong, and in some cases could supersede the local legal system – could pose the most serious threat to the territory’s cherished civil and political freedoms since its handover from Britain to China in 1997.While it is unclear how these crimes will be defined, who they will affect and what mechanisms protect the rights of those accused, many are concerned the law could be used to prosecute pro-democracy activists, human rights workers, journalists and lawyers, the way similar laws have been used to target their counterparts in the mainland. Although Hong Kong’s mini-constitution requires it to enact a national security law, residents are fiercely protective of the rights they enjoy under the city’s separate legal system, and have resisted moves that could threaten these rights. In 2003, a proposed national security bill sparked massive protests that resulted in the indefinite shelving of the law.The protests that began last summer have become the biggest crisis in Hong Kong’s history. Sparked by a proposed bill allowing extradition to mainland China, they have since morphed into a broader pro-democracy movement that directly challenges China’s ruling Communist party. Peaceful rallies have been replaced by violent clashes between protesters and police. At least 8,981 people, including 1,707 children, have been arrested. Universities have been besieged, livelihoods have been destroyed, suicides have soared and people have been critically injured.I feel an indescribable grief, watching Hong Kong fall apart from afar. Born and raised in the city, I moved abroad in recent years to pursue studies, after covering the city as a journalist in the aftermath of the umbrella revolution. When the protests started, I began having anxiety attacks that feel like I’m drowning on air.The first time it happened, I was walking through the lobby of my London apartment building the day after a mob attacked commuters in a Hong Kong train station. Scenes of bloodied chaos, and a man on his knees – begging attackers to spare women and children – flashed through my mind. I was overwhelmed with panic, gasping for air. Another time, I was reminiscing over ramen with another Hongkonger who reminded me of home when my chest tightened. She took me outside to get some air I tried not to cry. It happened again after a long argument over the phone with a loved one who supported the crackdowns. I struggled to get out of bed for two days.Sometimes, my anxiety boils into hatred. I hate watching the slow death of so much I cherish. I hate seeing the protests reduced to party chat, or an object of dispassionate academic study and media speculation and political exploitation. I hate interacting with Hongkongers who bury their heads in the sand, or trolls spreading abuse and misinformation. I hate feeling guilty about enjoying life in London, and inadequate about my solidarity from abroad, even when I know that me being in Hong Kong wouldn’t make much difference. I hate how grieving has become almost routine, how we all cycle through the familiar motions of shock, anger, despair, and resignation with each development. I hate that my writing fails to capture the suffering I see, and that my sorrow feels insufficient.With the passing of the national security law, the future feels bleak. Just this past month, many have been injured or arrested, a vigil commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre was banned, and a bill making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem was passed. This week, the traditional July 1 pro-democracy march has also been banned for the first time in 17 years, with officials citing public health concerns and violence in previous demonstrations.Upon every escalation, my friends and I ask one another: can we continue to adjust to these “new normals”? Can we ever be truly happy, or will we feel this heartbreak forever?Still, I want to hope for the best. I want to have faith in those who say fears over the law are overblown, that there is still room for political compromise. I desperately want to believe that Hong Kong can remain a haven in China for dissidents, journalists and activists, the way it has been for decades since so many first-generation Hongkongers arrived as refugees to its shores. But every time I let myself have hope, something terrible happens.As the pandemic lifts and the law goes into effect, I’m scared to watch what my home will become. I don’t know what to do, or how long we can go on like this. I have no answers. All I can do is try to sleep, wake up – and keep on watching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac96d8471195bf44ce18d8ef955d21072685d210/0_89_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=058f345a3f144d5e57d2f0ac68393f6c","title":"the switch to cloud how public services are becoming more agile and innovative","story":"The cloud offers the scope for a more responsive, flexible approach to delivering online services – enabling government departments to innovate in ways that were once beyond their reachYou may have noticed it’s a lot easier these days to get things “done” online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.Whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative app for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle’s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle’s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it’s infinitely scalable and cost effective.Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation’s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. “Traditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation’s needs may have moved on,” Appleton-Norman explains.By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte’s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.“The cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,” she says. “With the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it’s great, if they don’t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.”This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.“You would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that’s just not necessary all year round,” says Appleton-Norman.“It works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn’t have to be permanently available.”Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.“Most organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,” she says.“The thing they don’t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it’s not just about servers and software. If you’re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?”This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens’ lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation’s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc208e6aa4dc5b5e2206c479f41f1534dc2a1d5/0_75_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0391a78063bb4a36cf45de536197cb01","title":"ban burning and burying of animals in us covid 19 farm culls ngos urge","story":"As coronavirus forces many farmers to cull their animals on-farm, burying animals in unlined pits or burning them in open air pyres could pose risk to the public, activists argueAs the row over mass animal cullings in the US continues, public and environmental health NGOs are asking the government to ban two livestock carcass disposal methods – burying in unlined pits and burning in open air pyres – until the Covid-19 pandemic is “resolved”.Risks to the public from the methods, say the groups, include increased air pollutants such as carcinogenic compounds, or bacterial and fecal matter leaking into local water ways.The coronavirus crisis has hit the US’s largest slaughterhouses particularly hard. As a result, there is a lack of slaughter capacity, and farmers are being forced to cull their animals on-farm.About 10 million hens have already been killed and the pork industry warned in May that 10 million pigs could die by September.More recent estimates, said Iowa Pork Producers Association spokesperson Dal Grooms, suggest the pig figure is far too high, however.“Right now, one analyst says 2.1 million hogs have ‘disappeared,’” Grooms said. “We know those all weren’t euthanised, because we heard countless stories from across the US where pork producers were working on innovative ways to keep pigs in the food supply, including donations to food banks and private sales to iniduals who wanted to have that closer connection to their food.”Jim Monroe, the spokesperson for the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), called the petition, filed with the US Department of Agriculture and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), on 29 June by NGOs including Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), “an attempt by anti-livestock agriculture activist groups to use an unprecedented crisis to pile on hard-working farmers during a very challenging time”.Monroe said: “Pork producers follow all appropriate human health and environmental protocols for safe disposal and have been working with federal and state authorities to address this crisis since it started.”The NGOs fear that “under-regulated and poorly monitored animal disposal during the pandemic” will create serious public health risks. Where animals are incinerated on farms, “on-site incineration by pyre” risks exacerbating the air pollution, which is “a factor linked to higher Covid-19 death rates.”Pollutants emitted during open air incineration, it said, include “carcinogenic compounds associated with reproductive, developmental, and immune system problems”.For unlined burials, where there is no barrier between animal carcasses and the soil, “there are health risks from bacteria and fecal matter leaking into the water table,” said Hannah Connor, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.To make it easy for people to find out if carcasses are buried or burned near homes or water supplies, the petition asks APHIS to create an “electronically searchable and sortable database”.For chickens, said Connor, one of the main cull methods is foaming. “Foam can have PFAS in it, that’s the family of chemicals that includes PFOS. PFAS chemicals are linked to a range of health issues including cancers, kidney problems and suppressed immune systems.”Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are sometimes called “forever chemicals”. A recent film, Dark Water, inspired by a true story, portrays the damage done by PFOS to people in the West Virginia town of Parkersburg, starting in the 1950s. The PFOS, or C8, was used in the manufacture of Teflon.“These chemicals are harmful even in extremely low levels and very persistent in the environment,” said the senior NRDC attorney Valerie Baron.Neither the American Medical Veterinary Association (AVMA), which publishes depopulation guidelines, nor USDA-APHIS replied to questions about PFAS in foams used for depopulation. Nor was there an immediate response from chicken trade body, Delmarva Poultry Industry (DPI). DPI has previously been unresponsive to questions about culls and methods.NRDC staff scientist Anna Reade said “nothing prevents industrial animal producers from using PFAS containing foam, which is firefighting foam, for poultry depopulation, and we have heard reports it is happening. Most foams on the US market contain PFAS.”The USDA-APHIS spokesperson did confirm it received the petition. They said the department “will look into it. At this time, that’s all of the information we have available.”The petition gives USDA-APHIS seven days to respond. If nothing is done by then, Connor said the NGOs will consider going to court.In a separate US development, 12 animal activists are facing charges including burglary and misdemeanours related to a recent undercover video investigation of a mass pig cull in Iowa using an approved cull method called Ventilator Shutdown Plus (VSD+). The method involved shutting down pig shed ventilation and introducing steam to cause death by hyperthermia.On 19 June, local Iowa paper the Des Moines Register reported that the pork producer where animal rights organisation DxE said it filmed the VSD cull had stopped using the method. The producer did not respond to emailed questions or calls.Send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fbd8bd9ab2cb273955b3671a8eae0f6fdb86c55/0_313_4032_2421/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bb578bd78933b7e64026d0c3328cf68","title":"earths final frontier the global race to map the entire ocean floor","story":"An ambitious project to chart the seabed by 2030 could help countries prepare for tsunamis, protect marine habitats and monitor deep-sea mining. But the challenge is unprecedentedOn a wall facing Vicki Ferrini’s desk hangs a giant map of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. At 6ft by 8ft, it’s the largest size available on the printer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where she works as a geoinformatics researcher. “I of course want it even bigger,” she says.The map is busier than a usual world map. Rather than showing featureless, flat blue ocean, here the seafloor bursts with detail: mountains, canyons, channels and plains that resemble the texture of land. Ferrini encourages her staff to print pictures of the seafloor features they’re researching and tack them to the map. One example off the coast of Argentina shows ripples in the seafloor reaching a hundred metres high. The map has a distinctly Sherlock Holmes-about-to-break-a-big-case look to it. “I’m trying to see the scale of the ocean,” she explains. “The big picture – but also the fine details.”Mapping requires an ability to see the forest as well as the trees – or in this case, the coral as well as the sea. It’s a particular challenge when it comes to the ocean, the vast majority of which is not just unmapped, but unknown. Ferrini’s map is humanity’s best effort to date: a crucial document in what has become a race to map the entire seafloor by the end of the decade.The stakes are high. A series of reports have warned of the ocean’s impending collapse. The First World Ocean Assessment, published by the UN Environment Programme in 2015, revealed that the ocean’s very ability to function was in jeopardy. The following year, an OECD report estimated that the ocean economy employed 31 million people full-time and generated $1.5 trillion each year. Maps – or the lack thereof – play a role in nearly every critical ocean issue, from sea level rise to ocean acidification to bioersity.It’s often said that humanity knows more about the surface of the moon than we do the seafloor. It seems astounding that faraway planets can be more accessible than our own. But we tend to skip over why it is so difficult to map the seafloor: there is a massive obstacle in the way called the ocean. Light travels far and fast in space, but the laser altimeters that we use to chart celestial bodies are ineffective in water – the lasers are simply absorbed.Sound, on the other hand, travels more efficiently underwater than it does in air. The gold standard for seafloor mapping today is a multi-beam echosounder, which can be attached directly on to the hull of a ship. The device sends down a fan of sound waves, which computers decipher into a three-dimensional portrait of the seafloor’s shape and composition. Additional techniques also collect water temperature and salinity along the way.It is slow work. Ferrini recently sent another version of the map, this one blacking out all the uncharted ocean today. The coastlines were lit up with data. So, too, were well-traversed shipping lanes. The rest sat in darkness, except for a few pinpricks of light.Few countries need accurate maps of the seabed more than Japan, an island nation whose future is uniquely intertwined with the ocean’s, and it is the Nippon Foundation , a Japanese non-profit organisation run on the gambling proceeds of motorboat racing, that is backing Seabed 2030 with $2m every year. In the past, the foundation has addressed thorny global challenges such as eliminating leprosy or fighting food insecurity, and a complete seafloor map fits within its mandate, as well as Japan’s wider national interests. Seabed 2030 would improve Japan’s fisheries management and its tsunami and typhoon preparation, as well as clarify territorial claims in the South China Sea.But the mapping is a truly global collaboration, public and free to use, ided among four regional centres. The Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany took the Southern Ocean Stockholm University and the University of New Hampshire cover the North Pacific and Arctic New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research are responsible for the South and West Pacific Ocean. That leaves the largest swath, the entire Atlantic and Indian Oceans, to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University – Ferrini’s team.The finished map itself is created by a fifth centre, based in the UK: the British Oceanographic Data Centre in Southampton. It collects the analysed data from the four centres and compiles it in the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (Gebco). The data is in the public domain, free to use, adapt and commercially exploit.It is making remarkable new discoveries all the time. Off Florida, a reef of mid-ocean corals turned up in the Gulf of Mexico, a shipwreck. A forthcoming study on ice sheets will use Gebco to unpack how the ocean influences melting and raises sea levels. Where Gebco could be used in deep-sea mining, however, would be to help the ISA to better regulate the industry, he says – something of a double-edged sword, depending on your point of view.Another potential controversy is whether mapping introduces more noise to an already noisy ocean. Air guns, naval sonar and shipping traffic are increasingly edging out marine mammals that rely on sound to hunt, navigate and communicate. New research from graduate student Hilary Kates Varghese at the University of New Hampshire revealed that the multi-beam echosounders used by Seabed 2030 did not disrupt the feeding behaviour of Cuvier’s beaked whale, one of the more sonically sensitive marine mammals. However, research biologist Annamaria DeAngelis at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out that because Seabed 2030 is mapping the entire ocean, “more studies will be needed to expand our knowledge of how their particular echosounders will affect marine mammals in a variety of habitats.”One way to reduce noise is to crowdsource from ships that are already charting the ocean. When the multimillionaire Victor Vescovo went on a mission to reach the deepest point of all five oceans, Seabed 2030 mappers collected soundings along the journey. Other industry partners are donating whatever data they can. Crowdsourcing is crucial – from cruise ships, hydrographic offices, even weekend boaters with a decent sounder. By itself, a single ship would need 200 years to map the rest of the uncharted seas.However, “sharing data is a little taboo”, says Tinah Voahangy Martin, a member of Ferrini’s staff who often approaches institutions located on the Indian Ocean to ask for seafloor information. Seafloor data is often considered proprietary, classified or simply too valuable to give away. “You don’t want to be the person who comes in and says ‘Hi, you do this and we expect this.’ You take them on as a partner. That’s the best way to get them involved.”Ferrini adds that, because science in the US is often taxpayer-funded, it creates the expectation that data will always be freely available. “We have to remind ourselves that the whole world doesn’t work that way, and figure out how we can make it mutually beneficial.”Nevertheless, at their rate of progress, the finish line of 2030 seems possible. But completing the map on Ferrini’s wall is just the beginning. “There’s still so much more for us to do and know than the shape of the seafloor,” she says. “This is just one piece of a much bigger picture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72494dbd2c098c747b497c94abcf5a775bc04a5b/109_0_988_593/master/988.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=801a70e1f3389d236f3ffe52c1459424","title":"carl reiner farewell to the heavyweight master of american comedy","story":"Much-loved writer, producer, director, actor, quiz host … and creator of a style of comedy stamped indelibly on US television and film As the 21st-century dawned, it had looked as if comedy legend Carl Reiner’s final moment in the spotlight might be his small bittersweet role in Steven Soderbergh’s heist caper remake Ocean’s Eleven in 2001. He played Saul Bloom, the elderly conman and droll mentor to the two dudes in charge: Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), a role he reprised in two sequels. When Rusty initially tries to engineer a surprise meeting with Saul at the racetrack for recruitment purposes, it is Saul who catches Rusty unawares, tolerant but unimpressed. “I saw you at the paddock before the second race, outside the men’s room when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning.” And he isn’t tempted when Rusty asks what he would want to get involved: “Nothing. I’ve got a duplex now, I’ve got wall-to-wall and a goldfish. I’m seeing a nice lady who works the unmentionables counter at Macy’s. I’ve changed.”Reiner delivered the lines with a terrific naturalism, humour and grit. Yet his work rate continued unabated and almost 20 years later, in 2018, he had another sensational moment in the public eye – as the oldest celebrity on Twitter. He caused social media uproar by lambasting Trump before the 2018 midterms. “I’m 96-and-a-half years old. I lived through the Great Depression I served in World War Two in our fight to defeat fascism I’ve seen the invention of television and performed on television, even before my family owned one. But what I’ve never seen is the American people being lied to every day …”This was a weighty intervention from American showbusiness royalty – or maybe deity. As writer, producer, director and actor, the indefatigably funny and productive Reiner had been around Broadway, around television, around Hollywood for six decades one of the great titans and founding fathers of postwar Jewish American humour. Actually, his Trump broadside was hardly his first political adventure. In 1947, as a member of the American Labor party, he MC-ed a charity evening at Carnegie Hall in New York for veterans of the Spanish civil war, an event that caught the attention of the FBI. At the height of McCarthyism the bureau sent two agents to Reiner’s house to ask if he might care to name the communists of his acquaintance in the television industry. In his memoirs, he recalls: “I’m afraid I can’t,” I answered, smiling sincerely. “And why can’t you?” “Because I don’t know who they are,” I explained. “Communist actors don’t go around telling you that they’re communists!” It was a bravura performance that sent the G-Men on their way.After his wartime service, Reiner acted in Broadway musicals and got his big break acting in and writing for Sid Caesar’s Your Show of Shows in the 1950s. He became part of the great generation that included Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Lucille Kallen, Selma Diamond, Woody Allen and Mel Tonkin. After this, Reiner’s tall, handsome bearing and rich voice got him work as host of game shows and panel shows, and it also made him an excellent straight man to the comedian who was to be a longtime partner: Mel Brooks. With brilliant intuition, Reiner improvised feed lines to Brooks’s “2,000-year-old man”, the elderly sage who would pronounce wisely on all topics.But his great moment on television was as creator of The Dick Van Dyke Show, about the writer of a fictional TV programme, equably played by Van Dyke himself with Mary Tyler Moore as his wife – who was to graduate away from this demure stereotype with her own show, a feminist landmark in the way TDVDS obviously wasn’t. But Reiner almost singlehandedly created a comedy language which was to endure for decades, giving us later Jerry Seinfeld in Seinfeld, Tina Fey in 30 Rock and Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm.As a film-maker, Reiner worked from the late 60s to the late 90s, most memorably collaborating with Steve Martin as writer or director or both, particularly on the lovingly detailed 40s thriller pastiche Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982), and on the comedies The Jerk (1979), The Man With Two Brains (1983) and All of Me (1984), starring Martin and Lily Tomlin. He also directed Oh, God! (1977) from a screenplay by Larry Gelbart, featuring George Burns as the benign God who appears to John Denver’s harassed supermarket manager. Reiner often professed a fondness for his early, cult black comedy Where’s Poppa? (1970) starring George Segal as a depressed man who tries to scare his elderly mother to death.And all this ran alongside a staggeringly productive line in acting work, which won Reiner a shelf-full of Emmys and also Grammys for the perennially popular recordings of The 2,000-year-old Man with Mel Brooks. And he created a kind of dynasty in that his son Rob was of course to be a great movie director on his own account, and it was Rob’s mother Estelle – that is, Carl’s wife – who delivered the legendary line “I’ll have what she’s having” in When Harry Met Sally.Carl Reiner was a great master who had proved his worth and staying power over years. For me, one of the funniest and most fascinating parts of his autobiography, I Remember Me, is his recounting of an intense discussion he had as a young TV writer about which number was the funniest, as the punchline for a sketch about roulette. Just as “chicken” is funny because of the hard “ck” sound, so there must be a funny number — and Reiner incidentally discounted “69” because of the sexy connotation. He wanted something more purely funny. Finally, mysteriously, he and his colleagues settled on 32, and 32 duly got a massive laugh. Reiner was the Gandalf or the Merlin of the American comic tradition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f82f18264b2c11f725677394890cd0af708fe37/127_1010_4482_2689/master/4482.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3d123da1c529cd7b0ac482dbe1698e22","title":"newcastle takeover saga close to resolution richard masters tells mps","story":"The Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, has hinted Newcastle’s takeover could be concluded shortly but he was warned by MPs it would be “humiliating” to allow a Saudi Arabian consortium to take charge given the country’s record on piracy and human rights.Masters, appearing in front of the culture and sport department select committee, was repeatedly asked how the league could approve the deal when the World Trade Organization had ruled the Saudi state had facilitated the beoutQ pirate broadcasting that illegally showed games and also blocked the Premier League taking legal action to stop it.“Louis Tomlinson, the singer from One Direction, found himself blocked when he tried to take over Doncaster Rovers,” Nicholson said. “He might be responsible for crimes against music but the grizzly Prince Mohammed bin Salman was implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, who was lured into the Saudi embassy and chopped up into little pieces. You could find Bin Salman passing the fit and proper test and taking over a club – that would be humiliating for you surely?”Masters said he could not comment on that matter because it was a confidential process. However he pointed out that when it came to piracy, the Premier League had been robust in defending its rights holders.“I think our views on what’s happened in Saudi Arabia around beoutQ are on public record and obviously we were extremely frustrated with that process,” he said. “What we want – off the back of the WTO report and our own efforts and those of other sports – is for Saudi Arabia to respond positively to the situation and allow sports rights holders to protect their rights.”Masters was also criticised by the Labour MP Julie Elliott for keeping Newcastle fans in the dark, given the process of approving the takeover, which was supposed to take three weeks, had taken more than three months.“In a perfect world, takeovers would happen cleanly, clearly and in a timely fashion,” he replied. “Sometimes things get complicated.”Later Masters confirmed he would “like the process to conclude shortly”, before adding: “Some takeovers are straightforward and others aren’t. But if they can find the right people for their football clubs, they will be allowed through, and if not the right people, they won’t.”Masters also denied the Premier League had been put under pressure by the government to look favourably on the Saudi deal for Newcastle. “You are suggesting we were put under pressure to go one way or another,” he said. “That has not happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d120a96a1ec2d5a135341adef48cd26133739bd7/0_231_3143_1884/master/3143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd577de1400cde3285a9761a1830ad37","title":"english football not back until women playing again too womens super league","story":"With the WSL not restarting until September, women’s football is not on equal ground, writes MP Julie ElliottAs the Premier League season gets back into its rhythm following the immense energy and investment put into Project Restart, it is easy to look at the cancellation of the Women’s Super League with disdain, especially in light of women’s football restarting elsewhere.After the World Cup in France last year provided a catalyst for a record-breaking WSL season, we saw attendances and viewers up, technology such as the FA player taking the game to new audiences, and players becoming household names across the country. It was therefore disappointing to see the fanfare and effort put into getting the men’s game back in comparison with the women, who saw cancellation for the top two tiers, and a nulling and voiding for those below, not least for Sunderland AFC Ladies who were about to be promoted to the Championship having been runaway leaders of the National League North all season.The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport stood up at a press conference and announced that football is back, but in reality, only men’s football is. Young girls who are dreaming of playing football when they are older will only see professional men’s football on their screens until autumn.But it is important to remember the sport will not be starting from scratch when it finally returns. It will be building on the success of the Lionesses, on the incredible games that took place last season with record-breaking crowds and viewers, and on the hard work of so many in the industry who have been working to advance the sport for years.As reported in the FA Gameplan for Growth 2017-20 final review, the increasing numbers involved in the sport are remarkable. Participation in women’s football has doubled to more than 12,000 teams, the average attendances at WSL and Lionesses games have doubled, and at grassroots levels more than 6,000 schools are receiving support on girls’ football alongside 1,600 FA Wildcat centres.The report also announced that 2.4 million women and 1 million girls are playing football in England, with a huge growth in the number of female coaches and referees – a remarkable achievement.It is through proper attention and investment in grassroots football, to bring equality in access to space and opportunity, that we will ensure women’s football has a bright future. In a combined approach, alongside increased visibility of the sport to build on the 11.4 million people who watched England fall short against the eventual world champions at the World Cup, the sport will build and strengthen.When the WSL gets going again in September, the same weekend that gave such a successful start to the season last year, it will be the start of a new season of opportunity but also of risk. While the gains and progress have been huge, the momentum has been essential, and we cannot let up in pursuit of progress in the sport. The current situation may seem bleak but the future is bright.Julie Elliott is the Labour MP for Sunderland Central, and a member of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884d1b80e2b37b5c98b88fddf763612a93191f7e/1075_2225_604_362/master/604.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=da429f5e11e813506b635b993e194621","title":"my day starts at 3am coronavirus fuels gruelling harare commutes in pictures","story":"Lockdown measures have meant getting to work is fraught with risk for those manning essential services in Zimbabwe’s capital. Three frontline staff reveal how they are coping with erratic buses, exhaustion and dangerIt’s a dark, nippy June morning before dawn and a queue is forming at Glen View 8 bus stop. A dozen or so people, mostly men, are there as 41-year-old Mairevei Mupombwi and her friend arrive at 4.43am carrying fleece blankets. The two women spread cloths on the ground to sit on and cover themselves with their blankets to keep warm. Mupombwi starts dozing.At 5.30am, the queue is now long and a man starts moving around with a permanent marker, writing numbers on people’s hands. Although it is still dark, Mupombwi is number 31 and by 5.44am, the last person in the queue is number 65. Muffled voices can be heard as people try to make conversation through their masks.Moments later, Mupombwi stands up, telling her friend she can feel ants getting into her clothes. She folds her cloth and puts it in her bag but keeps the blanket over her shoulders.As the first rays of the sun appear, there is no sign of the bus. Several buses pass but they’re all going in the direction opposite to central Harare, where she and the rest of the people in the queue want to go. As the sun warms up, she puts her blanket away. The conversation at the bus stop is now getting louder. You can clearly see men and women, young and old, wearing face coverings, others have them but have chosen not to wear them.At 7.10am, the first bus comes and parks a distance away. There is chaos, and the once orderly queue disintegrates as dozens of people run towards it. No one is allowed to board and no one knows exactly what is going on. The people start coming back to the queue saying that no one can get into town as all roads have been sealed off by the police and security forces. They start urging others to go back home.A few minutes later, another bus arrives, and Mupombwi and her friend manage to get on. There is a man at the door, squeezing sanitiser on to passengers’ hands as they board. Once on the bus, passengers observe social distancing.It is now 8.18am and the bus stops at Market Square. Mupombwi gets off and makes her way towards Avondale, where she works in a supermarket. She hails a private car at 8.43am and by 8.48am she arrives at work.Mupombwi says: “My typical day starts at 3.30am where I have to warm my water to bathe and by 4am I am leaving the house. I wait for my friend and we walk together to the bus stop and it takes us about 30 minutes. The bus sometimes comes at 6.45am, and if it is late, it comes after 7am. It’s the same coming home from work. We have to wait in long queues. I get very tired, and during my off-days, I just want to sleep.”Mupombwi’s story is not unique, and many frontline workers in key industries have been affected by the country’s lockdown. They are spending more time travelling to and from work, and being deprived of sleep and quality time with loved ones.Zimbabwe imposed a lockdown on 30 March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Under the current restrictions, only the government-owned and run transport operator Zimbabwe United Passengers Company (Zupco) is permitted to run. Private operators have been banned and directed to register under Zupco if they hope to continue operating.Many workers have been forced to start their day earlier than usual, walking in the dark, sometimes hitchhiking – a dangerous pursuit in Zimbabwe. While travelling, these workers are at risk of contracting the virus as commuter queues rarely observe social distancing.Sandra Chikore, 33, works at a tobacco auction floor and faces the same transport problems as Mupombwi. The tobacco industry is key to the country’s economy, and this is a busy time of year. She rises at 4.35am and by 5.45am she leaves the house, walking close to 2km to get to work on time.“I leave the house while it is still dark and walk along the main road, flagging private cars. My mother’s asked me if I am not afraid for my life. I am, but have no choice. When coming back from work, I have to wait for the bus and sometimes I get home around 8pm, and I am just tired and want to take a bath, eat and sleep. I do not have much time to spend with my son any more.”On the main road at 6.29am, an open truck stops and Chikore hops in with one other passenger, who sits in front. There are three other people in the back, all male. Along the way, the truck stops and two more men jump in. Eighteen minutes later, she arrives in town and walks to Market Square, where she boards a bus. Almost an hour later, at 7.25am, Chikore reaches her workplace.Archiford Zisengwe, 38, works at a petrol station, an essential service. He has been going to work since lockdown began. Zisengwe lives in Harare’s south-west suburb of Waterfalls and works in Groombridge, north of the capital.“There is no transport to take me directly to town so I leave the house at 4am every day and I go to Mbare. From there, I find transport into town and then from there, Groombridge. Some of the places we pass through are very dangerous.”The government recently relaxed social distancing rules and all buses now carry to capacity. However, the move has not alleviated the transport problem and for workers such as Mairevei, Chikore and Zisengwe, they continue to wake up early and spend much of their time waiting in queues.Besides sleep deprivation and losing time with loved ones, many key workers are at risk of infection on public transport due to difficulties with social distancing. They also face the threat of physical attack in a country where violence and crime are rife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d2969cad7c3a89c2205ca91e91b4f1a356f373c/3_0_5340_3206/master/5340.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5e3379878bd6d2dc4ab41d646c0f2fba","title":"khruangbin psych rockers texas rise","story":"How the Texan trio’s woozy sound, inspired by Thailand, Mexico and west Africa, perfected the art of ‘Earth music’Onstage, the Texan trio Khruangbin are a strange sight to behold. At their sold-out show at London’s near-5,000 capacity O2 Academy Brixton last December, guitarist Mark Speer and bassist Laura Lee, dressed in long, black, heavily fringed wigs, sway in unison, while bald drummer DJ Johnson sits calmly in his poncho, pensively holding the groove. All three sing amorphous vowel sounds over Speer’s downtempo, wailing guitar melodies while the crowd of teens, jobbing musicians and parents savouring a night out howl along to the strings, trying to keep up with their electric range.Formed in 2013 in Houston, Texas, Khruangbin have come a long way from their origins playing in the band of the same church that Beyoncé used to attend. With only the backing of the indie label Night Time Stories, the group have built a sizeable following who have kept them on the road almost continually for the past four years, a singalong crowd dedicated to the blend of easygoing funk, Tex-Mex and touches of west African rhythm they have showcased over two albums. They count Jay-Z among their fans, have 3.9m monthly listens on Spotify and were set to headline London’s 20,000-capacity Cross the Tracks festival this month. All this with a band name (meaning “airplane” in Thai) that most of their fans struggle to pronounce. On the face of it, the band’s crossover success is as peculiar as their stage presence.“When you see us play, it should look like we just fell on to this planet,” Speer says from Oakland, California. “We play Earth music, like we’ve listened to all these different genres – from west African rhythms to Mexican and south Asian melodies – and now here we are.” This unpredictable blend of sounds has led to a slew of miscategorisations when it comes to the band’s output it’s regularly referred to as either “Thai funk”, “classic soul” or “psychedelia”.For Speer, their “Earth music” is an amalgamation of cultures filtered through their own Texan lens a recapitulation of the contentious othering of “world” music. “When you normalise English-language music in the west and decide to call everything else ‘world’, belittling it in the process, that’s fucked up,” he says. “There’s so much other music out there, of all languages, that needs to be appreciated and it’s why we try to make our own output as universal as possible.” This means an emphasis on impressionistic, almost parodically simple lyrics (the repeated “white cat” on 2015’s Mr White, for instance, or the “yes, this is the third room” refrain on 2018’s Evan Finds the Third Room) that are sung by all three members in unison.“We all sing together in the band, so our lyrics need to resonate with all of us and with the audience, too,” says Laura Lee, with her wig on, over a video link from Miami. “It makes sense to me that we’ve grown such success internationally since our instrumental music largely tries to avoid language barriers and we’re just inviting people to have an emotional connection with the music on their own level.”Some might see this anything-goes attitude to music as a form of cultural appropriation, yet Speer justifies it by virtue of their living in Houston. “There’s such ersity here, from west African to south-east Asian, Mexican and Caribbean communities, it’s impossible to ignore how their music makes up the identity of Houston,” he says. “That all feeds inevitably into what we make.”In a rare break from being on the road, she went on a hike to a waterfall with a new friend, Mordechai, and ed in. “That jump really did something for me: I realised that we had all been swimming deep underwater without breathing and without really knowing where we were going for the past few years, just chasing every opportunity instead,” she says. “I had to stop to ask what’s important to me and why.” She spent the following day in self-imposed silence in Houston, writing stories based on her experiences in the group and her family’s history that would form the basis of the band’s new record, named after that new friend who brought about this transformative experience: Mordechai.The album is a typically transporting Khruangbin listen: 10 tracks filled with reverb-heavy guitar, rumbling dubby basslines and that ever-present compressed groove, yet there is also a marked change in the presence of lyrics. Each number now features the band’s voices more prominently, from the communal dancefloor yearning of Time (You and I) to the repeated question “Where are you now?”, directed at Lee’s grandfather, on Dearest Alfred. It is a more personal venture for a band usually so shrouded in costume and presentation.In a way, Mordechai is the perfect anxiety-busting album for our frantic times. “We record in a barn out on a remote Houston farm, which has played a big part in our sound,” says drummer Johnson. “The serenity of having nature surround us means it doesn’t make sense for us to then be playing hard and fast. We don’t want to take up all the sonic room when you can hear birds and bees outside there should be space for that, too.”Forced to pause their touring schedule in support of the new record, each member is isolating apart and getting their head round not permanently being in each other’s company. “Four years flew by on tour and I missed four years’ worth of weddings, birthdays and babies being born,” says Lee. “But I also created an incredible family in the process with Mark and DJ, so I feel very grateful for that. Maybe now I can make time for my other families and friends, too.”The break has helped shed a new light not only on the band’s career but on the larger, mystical questions of life. “The whole experience of making this album has just helped me focus on the process rather than the results,” she says. “Life is the journey and death is the destination, so we shouldn’t be in such a rush to get there.”Mordechai is out now "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8adc192e377b3c9508dea8e753470f456fa44a4c/0_5_1811_1087/master/1811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45a77918c232bbad6ab2a007eccef78d","title":"off their heads the shocking return of the rave","story":"With clubs shut, thousands of young people are breaking the Covid-19 rules to attend parties organised on social media – and more are being set up every dayWhen Daisy Nook started trending on Twitter on the evening of 13 June, many users of the site thought it was a reference to the popular video game Animal Crossing, which features characters called Daisy and Nook. But Paul Carroll knew better. The 59-year-old police trainer had seen the saucer-eyed teenage girls and lads swigging from cans of beer flooding into Daisy Nook country park, in Greater Manchester, as he took his dogs for a walk that evening. Carroll stared at the revellers in astonishment. Illegal raves simply do not happen in Daisy Nook.It was not a restful evening. The traffic outside Carroll’s house was relentless, as was the whoosh of the nitrous oxide balloons the young people were huffing as they marched through the country park to the rave site, an empty field accessible from a canal path. Just after midnight, Carroll found a group of young men urinating on his garden wall. Insults were exchanged. “I wasn’t scared,” Carroll says. “I would have given as good as I’d got!” He backtracks. “Well, there were seven of them and I hadn’t got any shoes on.” After that encounter, Carroll’s wife told him to stop going outside. But he couldn’t sleep, so Carroll sat and watching the road, enraged. More cars. More balloons. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.About 4,000 people raved in Daisy Nook that night. Meanwhile, another 2,000 people attended a “quarantine rave” in Carrington, 15 miles away. Similar raves have popped up throughout June. Staffordshire: 1,000 people raved in Brookhay Woods, near Lichfield. Liverpool: hundreds of revellers danced to house music in a forest near Kirkby. Bristol: 1,000 people gathered in Stokes Croft. Leeds: police shut down a rave in an underpass of the M1 motorway as shocked motorists watched participants flood on to the road one clubber Vogued his way down the hard shoulder. Manchester: hundreds gathered in a courtyard in Moss Side. The DJ kept shouting: “Welcome to Manchester.”Across the country, young people are ignoring lockdown, strapping on bumbags and making for woods and fields. With the coronavirus pandemic having closed bars and clubs and cancelled or postponed festivals, raves are sweeping the UK, just as they did during the “second summer of love” in 1988, when acid house swept the country and ecstasy and bucket hats were everywhere.But some of those who were around for the summer of rave in 1988 say the comparison ends there. Those raves were “about everyone coming together”, says Alon Shulman, the author of The Second Summer of Love: How Dance Music Took Over the World. “If we’re putting vulnerable people at risk due to coronavirus, that’s not in the spirit of the summer of love.” Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester’s night-time economy adviser – and the owner of the club The Warehouse Project – quickly condemned the ravers in Carrington and Daisy Nook. “You aren’t clubbers, just selfish idiots,” he tweeted.Hanging over these parties are the fears that such mass gatherings could lead to a second wave of coronavirus infections. “The idea that: ‘Yay, this is over, let’s celebrate,’ is very premature,” says Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds. “The prevalence of coronavirus is not nearly down far enough. This has not gone away yet.” Griffin points to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics that show that the decline in new Covid-19 cases has levelled off he says this, plus the absence of an established testing system, is deeply concerning.“Raves are a bad idea, even if they are outdoors,” Griffin says. “It’s a myth to say you can’t spread coronavirus in the open air. You’re exerting yourself, meaning that you have a higher respiration rate you’re in close proximity and you may have been taking drugs or drinking alcohol, meaning your awareness of physical distancing will be reduced.”The artist Jeremy Deller, whose rave documentary Everybody in the Place showcased the explosion of acid house, is more sanguine. “I think young people always want to be involved in illegal activity,” he says. “It’s a rite of passage.” However, he suggests that young ravers take a leaf out of the electronic music duo Altern-8’s book they wore chemical warfare suits and gas masks to DJ. “Thirty years ahead of their time,” Deller jokes.With the stakes so high, history may not be kind to these young ravers. “Perhaps, in 20 years’ time, people will turn around and say: ‘I went to a rave during the coronavirus pandemic,’ says Shulman. “Some people will say: ‘Amazing!’ and others will say: ‘You idiot. You’re the reason it went on for another six months.’”Finding these parties is simple: Instagram pages with names such as “Secret Forest Rave” or “Secret Quarantine Rave” link to Snapchat accounts, where locations are shared an hour before the event. Other raves are organised via WhatsApp groups. What is more difficult is getting illegal ravers to talk to me. Ravers who break the omertà can be blacklisted from future events – a risk many don’t want to take when they are facing a summer of cancelled plans. So, young people who hours before posted videos to their social media accounts of themselves dancing in a packed field tell me that I have the wrong person, or feign ignorance. “Jog on,” writes one. “Leg it, ya grass,” says another.Illegal raves are popping up faster than velvety mammals in a game of whack-a-mole. “Every time I look at Instagram I see another 10 raves being organised,” says Matty. “It’s going to get so much worse.” Supt Jonathan Davies of Merseyside police, which disrupted the Kirkby rave, says his force has attended four raves this month alone. “They are cropping up very fast,” he says. “It’s a national issue. All the forces are flagging them up. They are gathering momentum.”Young people were obeying the lockdown rules – until suddenly they were not. “The raves started to boom about a month after lockdown, once most people realised they weren’t going to get sick,” says Matty. Penny, a 27-year-old performer from London, recently went to an illegal rave in Hackney, east London. “A month ago, people would have said: ‘No you can’t go partying, that’s awful!’ But the way it’s been handled by the government, now we have a different perspective. They’ve given us such mixed messages all the way through … Boris Johnson wanted herd immunity, didn’t he? He’s achieved that, by being so wishy-washy about the whole thing.”The rave Penny attended was held in some artists’ studios she spent the evening banging a drum she found on the dancefloor and doing tarot readings for guests. “There was a postapocalyptic, glamorous vibe,” she says. “I really enjoyed it. Everyone was in the moment, dancing.”Davies says that some commercialised illegal raves – at which you have to pay for entry – have links to organised crime. “This looks like a group of people involved in criminality who’ve decided to start doing raves, charging £10 a head, and they are relentless. The same people are planning further events.” Greater Manchester police have issued a similar warning, stating that several of the 13 illegal raves they have stopped in recent weeks had links to organised crime, specifically the gangs that control the drug supply to the north-west of England.But enthusiastic amateurs are also getting in on the act. “I’m not a criminal or nothing,” insists Andy when I call him. “I didn’t think it would be as big as it was. It just snowballed.” Andy, who is in his early 20s and lives in Yorkshire, recently organised a rave for 400 people in some woods near Manchester (doing it closer to home seemed too risky). “It was banging,” he says. “I think everyone was just chuffed to be out the house. Everyone was off their heads, like, obviously.”These young ravers are unrepentant about breaking lockdown. “No one is physical distancing,” says Penny. “There’s a sense of nihilism now, like: whatever will be, will be.” Penny sees people in shops and in parks none of them are physically distancing, so why should she? Andy says the same was true at his rave. “Everyone was sweating and dancing together,” he says. “There was no two metres or anything like that.” In any case, says Andy, “the rules don’t make sense. You can’t go see your nana, but you can go to Primark? People are thinking: if you can go to Primark and buy yourself some thongs for a quid, you can go get some Es and get down a field and get out of your head.”It is not hard to see why illegal raves can act as a pressure valve for young people who have spent months indoors, away from their friends, schools, colleges or workplaces. “People feel trapped at the moment,” says Matty. “No one is on holiday. No one is at festivals. Nothing is open for the youth.”But it is more than that. For young people who have experienced only a commercialised club scene, illegal raves feel like discovering dance music in Technicolor. “Everything has got so commercial,” says Andy. “There was none of that. You could just do what you wanted.”“It feels like the 80s, like the resurgence of acid house,” says Katie, 23, who works in the music industry. She attended an illegal house music rave in woodland near Glasgow. “We had lockdown and now this is coming out of it … I think there will definitely be more and more raves throughout this summer.”Katie wore a face mask to her rave, but most people did not. A recent investigation by Vice into an illegal indoor rave found that clubbers had their temperatures taken on entry, as a precaution against coronavirus, but this was not the case at the rave Penny went to, which was held indoors. “If I was responsible for someone’s death, that would be awful,” she says.Spreading coronavirus is not the only thing that makes these raves so dangerous. At Daisy Nook, a 20-year-old man died of a drug overdose. In Carrington, three men were stabbed and a woman was raped. A girl was burned at the Kirkby rave. Two people were fatally shot at the Moss Side party. “These are dangerous places,” says Davies. “They tend to be derelict, there’s lots of water and electricity and they are isolated.” Even if you escape injury, rave-going can be a logistical nightmare. It took Katie and her friends hours to get home, after they persuaded a stranger who was camping nearby to give them a lift. “I did feel completely safe, but I definitely wouldn’t go alone as a woman,” says Katie.Yet, after so many months spent indoors, going out has never tasted so good. “It felt so lovely to let go for the night when everything is going crazy in the world,” says Katie. “And because it was risky, it gave you that extra bit of adrenaline.” Part of the thrill, too, is knowing that you got away with it. “Ah, mate,” whistles Andy. “It was a rush. We were proper buzzing all the way home.” They continued the party into Sunday daytime. Thankfully, Andy, who is a key worker, had taken Monday off.Promoters who don’t want their parties shut down by police should minimise the non-coronavirus risks. “Put security there,” Davies says. “Have adequate lighting. Don’t have your generator in a pool of water.” Although these raves are illegal under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Coronavirus Act 2020, police can exercise discretion when it comes to enforcing the legislation. “If we came across one that we deemed to be safe and there was no risk there, why would we cause the disruption to close it down?” says Davies.But what about when the party ends? Andy and his friends were in such a rush to get away from the site before police caught them that they did not clean up. “We tried our best,” he says, sounding sheepish. “But when it’s 6am and the sun’s coming up, and you’ve been up all night, you just want to get out of there.” Shulman is disapproving. “You’d never have had rubbish on the ground back in the day,” he says. “People were respectful.”It took 40 volunteers nine hours and 400 bin bags to clean up the devastation in Daisy Nook. Sandra Lord, a receptionist, was one of them. “It looked like a war zone,” she says, sighing. The promoters even left behind their equipment: having made £40,000 on £10-a-head tickets, Lord guesses that they did not fancy carrying it back up the hill. “I found used tampons, sanitary towels, faeces, wipes everywhere,” Lord says. Carroll’s neighbour found a used tampon in his hedge. Worse still were the thousands of discharged nitrous oxide gas canisters, which are made of metal and can be fatal to birds and other wildlife. “It was a sea of silver,” Lord says. “I couldn’t even guess how many of them I picked up. Thousands and thousands.”Despite the stakes for public health being so high, it is clear that something is catalysing in teenage bedrooms that were previously heavy with ennui: a second summer of rave, held in the squelching fields, tangled hedgerows and damp forests of Britain. Katie remembers looking up at the lights on the trees while dancing in the woodland near Glasgow. She says: “I had this feeling of: wow, people really will go far for a party, won’t they?”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecd4beae976d6cdedd2b846e0cf5cf3e6b1f79c/0_64_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3212df302b8a245869b2784b9ffd8492","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities.

Unlike other national security advisers since the role was created in 2010, Frost is not a civil servant but a political appointee.Frost will replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who will also step down from his roles as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, as part of a Whitehall shake-up announced on Sunday.May, who served on the national security council for nine years as home secretary and then prime minister, made her comments as Gove responded to an urgent question about Frost’s role in the House of Commons.She paid tribute to Sedwill, saying she had listened to expert independent advice from national security advisers for nine years and noted that Gove had made a recent speech saying the government should be able to promote experts to key roles.“On Saturday, my right honourable friend said we must be able to promote those with proven expertise. Why then is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?” she said.Gove replied: “We have had previous national security advisers, all of them excellent, not all of them necessarily were people who were steeped in the security world. Some of them were distinguished diplomats in their own right. David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right.” As Gove spoke, May grimaced and shook her head.Later, the former Labour minister Angela Eagle asked Gove to return to May’s question, saying he had failed to answer it. “What are his specific qualifications and expertise and why on earth was he considered for a second for this role?” she said.Gove replied: “The broader point is that David Frost is involved in one of the most complex diplomatic negotiations ever conducted and a diplomatic negotiation that relates specifically to defence and security cooperation as well as tariffs and trade.“He has been a civil servant for decades and it is the case that Mark Lyall Grant and Kim Darroch, who were national security advisers, were not people who were steeped in the world of intelligence and security. They were gifted diplomats and gifted civil servants and they were, as David will be, supported by a superb team in the national security secretariat.”It is the first time that May has launched an attack upon Johnson’s administration since she was forced from office last Summer. She appointed Sedwill to the role as national security adviser in 2017.Reports have claimed that Johnson told Sedwill he would nominate him to become Nato’s next secretary general.However, the post is not likely to become free until the end of 2022 when the incumbent, Jens Stoltenberg, is expected to retire after eight years in the role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd5a3e48760105b1209d9e88aa208e5add9ed7a/0_38_2340_1404/master/2340.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8875043a93f2fbe5b30d701e97c10dd5","title":"physical play with fathers may help children control emotions study finds","story":"Research suggests father-child play at an early age could benefit children as they get older Children whose fathers spend time playing with them at a very early age may find it easier to control their behaviour and emotions, which has a beneficial impact as they get older and start school, according to a new study.Research carried out by Cambridge University’s faculty of education and the LEGO Foundation looked at how mothers and fathers play with children aged 0 to 3 years and how it affects child development.While there are many similarities, it found that fathers tend to engage in more physical play like tickling, chasing, and piggy-back rides, which researchers claim appears to help children to learn to control their feelings.The research is based on a review of data from 78 studies, carried out mainly in Europe or the US between 1977 and 2017, which found a consistent correlation between father-child play and a child’s ability later to control their feelings.Researchers found that on average most fathers play with their child every day, but even with the youngest children play tends to be more physical, with fathers enjoying boisterous rough-and-tumble play with toddlers.Those children who benefited from “high-quality” playtime with their fathers were, according to the study, less likely to display hyperactivity, emotional or behavioural difficulties. They also appeared to be able to control their aggression, and were less likely to lash out at other children during disagreements at school.Paul Ramchandani, professor of play in education, development and learning at the University of Cambridge and one of the authors of the study, said: “Physical play creates fun, exciting situations in which children have to apply self-regulation. You might have to control your strength, learn when things have gone too far – or maybe your father steps on your toe by accident and you feel cross.”“It’s a safe environment in which children can practise how to respond. If they react the wrong way, they might get told off, but it’s not the end of the world – and next time they might remember to behave differently.”Children who only live with their mother need not be at a disadvantage, the authors point out. All parent-child play interactions in the early years are linked to more positive cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes for children.“One of the things that our research points to time and again is the need to vary the types of play children have access to, and mothers can, of course, support physical play with young children as well,” Ramchandani said.Fellow author Dr Ciara Laverty, from the LEGO Foundation, said the findings had policy implications, suggesting structures were needed that give fathers, as well as mothers, time and space to play with their children during the early years.“Even today, it’s not unusual for fathers who take their child to a parent-toddler group, for example, to find that they are the only father there. A culture shift is beginning to happen, but it needs to happen more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c3fc237de4a7b0445ac15b56967231ee1698818/173_219_3327_1997/master/3327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=772b1a31f49d4a909acd19286e1ed8e5","title":"england can only profit from using mark wood in the long run","story":"Durham quick has improved with a longer run-up and, handled carefully, can be a thrilling and vital fixture in the teamStatistics, like alcohol, should be used responsibly. Before you lay down quantitative truths to the world, you need to consider context, sample size … all the old favourites. We all know this, yet most struggle to adhere to it. Some manipulate statistics to present alternative truths, also known in some cultures as bare-faced lies.Others, such as the Spin, occasionally get giddy with a love of cricket and start to run wild, politely telling the more sensible voices in their head where to stick their admittedly well-meaning concerns about the legitimacy of the sample size.To wit, Mark Wood’s Test career. We probably shouldn’t be doing this, but we can’t resist breaking it down into two distinct phases:Short run-up (2015-18) 12 Tests, 30 wickets at 41.73, strike rate 76.2, no five-fors.Long run-up (2019-20) 3 Tests, 18 wickets at 14.22, strike rate 26.2, two five-fors.Wood changed his run-up in the autumn of 2018 after a chat with one of his childhood heroes, Michael Holding (Wood had not been born when Holding played his last first-class game, in 1989, but watched videos of him when he was growing up). It reduced the stress on his body, particularly his troublesome ankle, and also his mind: Wood found he was no longer straining for rhythm, and his pace increased accordingly.You could never describe anything to do with Wood’s bowling as effortless – if Holding’s run-up led to the nickname Whispering Death, Wood is more Grunting Harassment – but bowling in excess of 90mph, sometimes 95mph, comes much more easily than it did before.He savaged West Indies in St Lucia last year, a spell that the great Scyld Berry said was the fastest he had ever seen from an England bowler, and proved it wasn’t a glorious one-off by ransacking South Africa with another scorching performance at Johannesburg in January. It is only three Tests with the new run-up, but Wood has been man of the match in two of them. If that is not good reason to get lost in Statsguru, we don’t know what is.In between, Wood missed the Ashes because of a side strain sustained during the World Cup, and a recurrence of the same injury would have kept him out of the Sri Lanka tour had it gone ahead in March. His stop-start-stop-again career tells us that, even if his ankle is better than before, he is inevitably going to miss games. If he plays one in every two Tests for the rest of his career, it would be good going.He is 30 years old now, an incongruous age for a man whose demeanour suggests he should be forever in his early 20s, and an unpleasant landmark for even the least injury-prone fast bowlers. But there is also the tantalising prospect that, for the next year or two, Wood could be the kind of weapon of mass destruction that England have not had since Frank Tyson in the mid-1950s. There are so many things to look forward to when Test cricket resumes next week: Jofra Archer, Ollie Pope, Chemar Holder, the brilliant Sky coverage, cricket itself. But nothing has got the Spin’s mind racing like Wood. It’s not just batsmen whose beans start going when they are exposed to fast bowling.Wood is more fascinating than most because of the variables involved in his career. We know, all things being equal, that Archer will end with hundreds of Test wickets at an average in the low-to-mid 20s. With Wood, anything could happen. It is not beyond the realms that he will pick up an injury in training and never play another Test. But it’s also conceivable that he will stay fit for long enough to help England be competitive – maybe even victorious – in their upcoming series in India and Australia.Wood’s speed, aggression and reverse swing make him England’s favourite travel accessory. His Test average away from home is much better than in England, which puts him in a minority, and Chris Silverwood, England’s head coach, would accept many a pact to have Wood available for at least three of the five Ashes Tests in Australia in 2021-22.Here are the averages of England’s main pace bowlers, at home and abroad:Wood’s performance in English conditions is less relevant, yet if he can terrorise West Indies and Pakistan this summer it will strengthen the belief that his new run-up has taken him to a tantalisingly high level. Besides, with Wood there is always the chance that tomorrow may never come, so we should enjoy every moment. One of the reasons he is so infectious is that he bowls like every spell could be his last. The success of 2019 – inidually at St Lucia, collectively in the World Cup – has left him at peace with a career that until then had been endlessly frustrating.When Wood gets it right, there is something fiendishly difficult about facing him, even in comparison to other seriously fast bowlers. It might be the lift he gets from just back of a length, or a frantic bowling action that makes the ball harder to pick up. Either way, CricViz’s ball-by-ball data shows that, when he bowls in excess of 90mph, Wood’s Test average drops from 34 to 15. Like Tyson, he is uncomplicated and violently quick.He is not particularly a product of the England and Wales Cricket Board pathway, just an ordinary bloke with extraordinary fast-twitch fibres. And a rare resilience: Wood has bounced back from umpteen disappointments with Tiggerish enthusiasm, going through hours and hours and hours of déjà vu in the gym.Tyson famously sledged batsmen by quoting Wordsworth, and spoke of the “glad, animal thrill” of fast bowling. In his own, earthier way, Wood is equally charismatic when he opens his mouth. All these recent sports documentaries that purport to reveal all are compelling but also selective. With Wood, perhaps more than any sportsman in the world, you really do feel like there is no edit function in his brain. He’s an antidote to a post-truth world, and the alignment of his personality and surname make it extremely difficult for weekly cricket emails to resist describing him as unvarnished.Wood’s honesty and self-deprecation make his interviews refreshing. So does his memory for detail. Nobody came close to painting as vivid a picture of the England dressing-room during the desperate climax to the World Cup final. One day he will make a great after-dinner speaker. All being well, the next couple of years will give him a few more stories to tell.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

She was 16, a prodigy who struck her backhand with two hands and had built her name that year with a junior and senior winning sequence across 45 matches. Clay was her surface of choice so the grass courts of the US Open seemed a challenge too far. Instead, she embarked on one of the sport’s most celebrated breakthroughs.As she marched through the draw, three times recovering from a set down to reach the semi-finals, pandemonium reigned. Fans shook the Forest Hills stadium, cheering the errors of her foes and tossing beer cans into the sky. The press scrambled to find the perfect moniker so she was dubbed “Cinderella In Sneakers”, “Ice Princess” and “America’s Sweetheart” all in one breath. When she stood triple match-point down in the second round before mounting a miraculous recovery, little girls in the stands cried.The run ended in the semi-final against the one person who deeply understood how it felt to be in the eye of such a storm: “I hope she enjoys it because her life will change abruptly,” Billie Jean King said. “Her life already has changed. She has no privacy any more. She belongs to the public.”One year earlier King had led a small group of the best female players as they broke away from the men to establish a new independent tour. They were determined to command a fairer share of the financial pie and they believed players on the Virginia Slims tour had the athleticism and talent to deliver. However, King was always cognisant of the world around her so they showed up to the press in full makeup and were all dressed on-court by the fashion designer Ted Tinling. Part of the success story of women’s tennis has always been its cynical use of glamour to appeal to more fans.In that sense Evert arrived on the scene as the perfect future figurehead. By 1974 she was the best player in the world after her French Open and Wimbledon titles. She also happened to be a white, blonde and attractive all-American gal and quickly became one of those rare people to transcend the sport. She endorsed everything from Rolex to cheese and her popularity helped to drive the 1970s US tennis boom.“She is quite taken with fashion people and actresses and the entertainment life,” her friend Kristien Shaw-Kemmer told Sports Illustrated in 1976. “But if she ever stopped to think how much more famous she is than all of those people, she might faint.”The greatness of Evert’s career is that her celebrity never overshadowed her success. When she arrived, three of the four grand slam tournaments were played on grass, where the ball skidded low and matches were a race to the net. She played on the home turf of serve and volley players yet she beat them all, pinning them behind the baseline and turning her matches into groundstroke battles nobody else could win.Her game was sometimes derided as unspectacular, with most compliments centred on her unwavering focus and consistency, but that belied the quality of her groundstrokes. Between her peerless two-handed backhand, her ability to find a passing shot from any part of the court and her command of the baseline, her success would begin the quiet revolution that has helped to shape the modern game.Her numbers would be even stronger had players made the four grand slam tournaments the priority they do now. Evert missed the French Open between 1976 and 1978 in the midst of her clay run and the best years of her career and, despite reaching the final each time, she travelled to the Australian Open only six times in her 19 seasons.As time has passed Evert’s success has become slightly underrated. Among many reasons, it is because her name will always be synonymous with Martina Navratilova’s. While they aptly ended their careers with 18 grand slam titles each, Navratilova finished their head-to-head contest with a 43-37 lead and dominated the second half of their 80 meetings, moulding the sport in her image as players, including Evert, raced to the gym in order to keep up.Evert’s legacy seemed far less significant during the height of her powers. By the time almost every player in the world was gripping their racket with two hands and intent on ruling the baseline, she was long retired. It is only now we can look at the way tennis is played and appreciate the role she had in bringing it to the masses and her enduring influence within the sport. That is some power.From the archiveChris Evert equalled the record of Helen Jacobs which had stood for nearly half a century at the United States Open championship at Flushing Meadow yesterday evening when she beat 16-year-old Pam Shriver 7-5, 6-4 in 96 minutes to win the women’s title for the fourth consecutive year. To say, though, that the younger generation was put in its place is to exaggerate grossly for, in the end, there were only a few points, a few errors between the two in a magnificent final … since losing to Evonne Goolagong in 1974 Miss Evert has now won 25 matches in the US Open and only once dropped a set.

The British Horseracing Authority announced at 11.19am that, despite the measures being taken to combat a spike in coronavirus cases, racing would go ahead at the Oadby venue, just outside the city.Graeme McPherson, who works as a QC as well as a racehorse trainer and has presented cases for the BHA, said: “I thought it was a real kick in the teeth to the people of Leicester, to say you can’t open your businesses, you can’t go out of your houses because the government say you shouldn’t travel except for essential reasons, and for the BHA then to say that, well, the local authority says we can go ahead with racing so we will.”McPherson took out his only entrant at Leicester, Homing Star in the 8.15pm race. “It seems to me that racing ought to be setting an example. Regardless of whether or not racing could go ahead, racing ought to be saying we won’t go ahead if every other business in Leicester cannot reopen.“Without wishing to sound over-dramatic, I was going to go to Leicester myself with someone else tonight and I thought, I can’t actually in all conscience send a member of staff there.

I thought, geez, I don’t understand why I’m going to the one city in Britain that the government has told to lock down.”His view was shared by Alan King, who has withdrawn Kismat from the 8.15pm and Party Potential from the 8.45pm race. “I honestly thought it would be called off,” said King. “They’ve obviously decided to go ahead but I did not feel comfortable about the situation at all. I spoke to my staff and they weren’t really overly keen to go and both my owners gave me full backing.“We’ve got to look at the big picture here. I genuinely hope it’s not a PR disaster. With what the city’s going through, we should not be driving through it with horse boxes. It’s only my opinion but I feel very strong about it and hence the reason why I haven’t sent them.”Mick Appleby, whose Oakham stable is 20 miles from Leicester racecourse, withdrew his three entrants. “Obviously, they’ve got a big outbreak in the area now, so why should racing be going ahead?” he asked. “It’s common sense that you’d call the meeting off.“We’re well away from the affected area but the racecourse is sort of in the centre of it. Oadby, where the racecourse is, that’s one of the worst affected areas. I just can’t see the point of taking the risk.“Hopefully nobody does contract anything but if somebody did test positive after attending the meeting, it’d mean that everybody who attended would have to go into lockdown. If I sent one of my staff to the races and they did come down with it after coming back to the yard, it risks everybody at the yard as well.”John Best also took out his only runner on the card after staff expressed concerns. “I think it’s got to be an inidual decision,” said the Kent-based trainer, “but I felt that my staff were not comfortable going there, partly because my travelling head girl’s mother is a vulnerable person. We discussed it with the owners and the owners said, if they’re not happy to go, we wouldn’t want them to feel uncomfortable going.“The risk of course is absolutely minimal but if anyone does get something and it’s publicised, the public perception as well as everything else is not going to be good for racing.”Chelsea Banham tweeted that she had decided not to send two runners from her Newmarket base, for the sake of the safety of her staff. Earlier, the British Horseracing Authority tweeted: “Following confirmation from local health authorities that the race meeting should go ahead, the fixture at Leicester will take place today. The fixture will be held behind closed doors and with the existing strict health screening and social distancing measures in place.”Hancock announced the local lockdown measures in the House of Commons on Monday evening, and specifically mentioned Oadby, the area just outside Leicester where the racecourse is sited, as one of the areas that would be included. He told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday: “It’s so important that we get a grip on this spike that has happened in Leicester.” He advised that people should not travel “in, out or within Leicester” unless it was essential.The news means Tuesday’s fixture is a rare example in recent times of a Leicester raceday going ahead after being in doubt. The track’s finances have taken a battering over the past year, mostly because of weather-related abandonments. At one stage this winter, the track had lost six race-meetings out of nine.Horse racing has been taking place at tracks around Britain for the past four weeks, with attendance limited to essential personnel and measures in place to guard against transmission of Covid-19. Masks are worn by jockeys, stalls handlers and others who may at times have to work within two metres of others.It’s a tricky situation when you stick two young horses in the tracker after their debuts and then they turn up in the same race. I really fancied Roberto Escobarr for a novice contest at Doncaster today but, as he’s become a non-runner, Matthew Flinders (3.30) really ought to be winning.Both were third in separate isions of a Haydock maiden three weeks back. Matthew Flinders took part in the marginally quicker of the two races and was travelling quite a bit better than the eventual winner at the three pole.Unfortunately for Oisin Murphy, racing room evaporated about a furlong later. The Siyouni colt ran on well once in the clear and was a really obvious eye-catcher.He should know more today and I imagine Murphy will be keen to avoid a repeat. They appeal, even at 11-8, and there might be a bit of 6-4 still hanging around.I thought Notforalongtime had strong claims earlier on the card and evidently at least one firm thought so too, as Clive Cox’s runner opened at 7-2. He is now 12-1, which is worrying enough that a watching brief seems the only responsible course.There’s some 4-1 about Ice Lord (2.00), who has slipped back to what looks a fair mark. His last win, at the end of 2018, was over this course and distance and he’s 5lb lower now.Chris Wall’s grey put up a really good effort on his reappearance, faring best of the hold-up horses in a Newmarket race in the first week of resumption, getting tired in the latter stages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c51b0d9d83e89091b105962b5f9f100fd5aebd/170_125_4758_2857/master/4758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=050891d977ecd1c670edc3f406cb68c5","title":"youtube bans david duke and other us far right users","story":"Six channels with supremacist content ‘repeatedly violated’ the site’s policy on hate speechYouTube has banned some of the video site’s most notorious far-right users, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, “alt-right” figurehead Richard Spencer and libertarian “race realist” Stefan Molyneux, joining a wave of social media sites taking action against hate speech.The company says the bans were handed down due to the creators’ repeated violation of YouTube’s policies against claiming that protected groups are “inferior”.“We have strict policies prohibiting hate speech on YouTube, and terminate any channel that repeatedly or egregiously violates those policies,” a YouTube spokesperson said.“After updating our guidelines to better address supremacist content, we saw a 5x spike in video removals and have terminated over 25,000 channels for violating our hate speech policies.”In all, the company terminated six channels: the three personal accounts, as well as Spencer’s Radix organisation, and two channels belonging to far-right publication American Renaissance.After long insisting that channels that preached white supremacy were within the rules provided they didn’t directly call for violence, YouTube began rewriting its guidelines in 2019. In June of that year, the company changed its hate speech policy to specifically prohibit “alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status”.Those changes came after the site had already taken action against high-profile users who had been careless enough to cross the line. Alex Jones, host of InfoWars, was removed from the site in 2018.Despite the changes, it took more than a year for the policy to result in the removal of the site’s most high-profile supremacists, while other notorious figures remain active on YouTube. EDL co-founder Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, was “restricted” on the site in 2019, but is still able to upload videos for pre-existing subscribers, though his account is removed from search results.The company’s action came the day after Twitch and Reddit both made surprise moves themselves. Reddit deleted more than 2,000 subreddits for repeated rules violations, including The_Donald, the notorious home of the US president’s most ardent fanbase. “To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit – but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception,” the company’s CEO, Steve Huffman, wrote in a post announcing the policy change.Livestreaming platform Twitch suspended the Trump campaign’s account for violating its policy against “hateful conduct”. “In line with our policies, President Trump’s channel has been issued a temporary suspension from Twitch for comments made on stream, and the offending content has been removed,” the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c101197884627a67ce52f0a67516a88393f16b/0_0_5381_3229/master/5381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62c2b8a26a836a6e724d4765aa651915","title":"are you thinking of booking a holiday abroad","story":"We want to hear from people who are considering or have booked a holiday abroad for the summer holiday or later in the yearThe current Foreign Office travel warning against all but essential international travel will be lifted from 6 July for countries deemed safe.

In some ways it still is. But as an early adopter of western things, from ideas to clothes, it is easy to see Japan as a familiar place. Even its unfamiliarity – Shinto shrines, sumo bouts – is recognisable as “Japan” nowadays. What is less recognisable is what Japanese writers say about their own country. Authors – not the documentarists about families living with robots – uncover the mystery. These books speak for a Japan that is often spoken for and about, and speculated about by others they speak for its history as it unfolded, for its culture as it is practised and its society as lived in and fought against.Ryū Murakami’s stories never shy away from shining a light on the darkest corners of society. In this 1980 novel that beam is amplified as it follows the entire lives of protagonists Kiku and Hashi, and all the ghastly goings-on they encounter. Both “coin locker babies” – children abandoned in one of Japan’s coin lockers (an issue arising in the 1970s) – the boys find themselves adopted by a childless couple living on an island off Kyushu, the south-westernmost of Japan’s main islands. They grow up against a background of urban and rural decay. Soon transplanting themselves to “Toxitown”, a fictional area of mayhem in Tokyo – home, it seems, to all that is swept under the rug in Japan, from foreigners and homeless people to drug dealers and other criminals – what follows is a surreal coming-of-age horror story that runs wildly through the heights of love and superstardom, and the lows of insanity and murder.“A convenience store is a world of sound.” The opening line of narrator Keiko’s breathless story of working part-time at a konbini (convenience store) is wonderfully evocative. Throughout, she likens the sounds of the store to church bells, and herself and her coworkers as members of a religion. It’s not just a testament to the minutiae of Japan’s selection of Lawsons, 7-11s and Family Marts, but also an existential challenge to normality. In an attempt to become a member of society, Keiko becomes a “cog” by working at the convenience store, before finding out there’s more to it than that. Like Jean-Paul Sartre’s waiter who is too “waiter-esque”, Keiko embodies how a convenience store worker should act – Japanese society in miniature – but in doing so, she moves further away from actual society, with its conventional marriages and babies, and the haughty couples concerned with all that.Part Lord of the Flies, part Oedipus complex, this book is a postwar howl of anguish. Actor, model, director and author Mishima’s protagonist, Noburo, is an adolescent boy living with his single mother, Fusako, in Yokohama. He also happens to be in a nihilistic gang with his schoolmates who are superficially “good” students. Though sex is alluded to throughout – Noboru discovers a peephole into his mother’s bedroom, for one thing – it’s the extreme disappointment Noburo feels in Fusako’s new lover, a sailor named Ryuji, whom he once admired, that sets the wheels in motion for an altogether brutal plan to restore glory. In real life, Mishima grew disillusioned with Japan’s postwar situation, and in 1970 he – along with other members of a right-wing militia that he founded called Tatenokai – stormed a military base in Tokyo and attempted to inspire a coup, delivering a speech to soldiers stationed there. Met with jeers, he committed seppuku (ritual suicide with a sword).This depiction of the interactions and pursuits of Tokyoites is a gentle, modern-day version of the Edo period (1603-1858) ukiyo or “floating world”, referring to the era’s burgeoning urban lifestyle. Kawakami’s transient world is one of endless dining out at izakaya (Japanese bars), of hanami (flower viewing) parties during cherry blossom season, and discussing baseball, a national obsession. Now, add the story of a thirtysomething woman’s growing relationship with a much older man, whom she calls “Sensei” – an elder-junior theme somewhat echoing Natsume Soseki’s bestselling Kokoro – and Strange Weather In Tokyo will have sweep you up in a heartwarming haze. Sōseki’s inaugural novel satirises Japan’s Meiji era (1868-1912), and its uneasy adoption of western ideas, through the life of a schoolteacher — his stupidity, his circle of friends, and what he does with his time. He’s a regular member of middle-class Tokyo, and is a fussy sort of person who gets annoyed when the neighbourhood children keep hitting a ball into his garden with a wooden stick (baseball had newly arrived in Japan at this time). The twist is that the whole novel is narrated by a cat with a holier-than-thou attitude, a wild take on authorship at any point in time, but even more so considering this novel’s serialisation from 1905-06. Japanese features multiple pronouns for “I”, but the cat uses wagahai to refer to itself (a high-register phrasing more appropriate to a nobleman), rare even at the time of publication. But the popularity of the book resulted in a resurgence of wagahai – and is still infrequently used by fictional, anthropomorphised characters.An insight into Japan’s past as much as a blueprint for understanding the country’s idiosyncratic style of westernisation, Tanizaki spins a web of conflicting interests in his 1929 novel. Kaname and his wife Misako are married, but not happily. Kaname’s father-in-law, “the old man”, thinks orce is out of the question, a western solution for problems caused by western ideas. Attempting to instil Japanese ideals in the couple and his young mistress, O-Hisa, the old man hopes to uphold traditions as Japan changes around him. Kaname, however, loves western things. He admires American film stars of the day. His dog even has an English name.Perhaps owing to the 2006 translation by Meredith McKinney, The Pillow Book reads as naturally as if it had been written today. Except it was written in the 990s and early 1000s by a lady-in-waiting of Fujiwara no Teishi, empress consort of Emperor Ichijo. This era in Japanese history, the Heian period (794-1185), was one of great significance – to nobles, anyway. Sei’s book is basically a collection of random thoughts, an ancient blog. She makes lists – of rivers, markets and other places that are either famous or have some poetic connection, or both – and writes opinionated indices with titles such as “people who seem enviable” and “things with terrifying names”. Most of the time, however, she provides a window into the courtly world: nocturnal visits from men, Shinto festivals, and the constant exchanging of witty poems between courtiers like carefully considered tweets.Dazai may be better known for his swansong – the autobiographical No Longer Human (1948) – but it is Schoolgirl, a 1939 novella, that made him famous. Narrated by the eponymous girl, the book is an unsung, prewar Japanese Catcher in the Rye for her everything is depressing, pathetic, disgusting: “Mornings are torture.” The narrator is sometimes an androgynous voice, at odds with herself and the world around her, but 81 years after publication her thoughts chime with the modern day. Possibly a veiled critique by Dazai (who was a Marxist) of ultranationalism, the schoolgirl is at one point “bored” by a teacher who went “on and on, explaining to us about patriotism, but wasn’t that pretty obvious? I mean, everyone loves the place where they were born.”The title may put some off, and depending on what edition is available, it may or may not have an electric pink cover, but Vibrator is glorious. The novel is set in Tokyo, at least for a bit, as protagonist Rei Hayakawa begins yet another trip down to her local convenience store. She’s a bulimic freelance writer who drinks too much, by the way. After a chance encounter at the store with a truck driver, Okabe, she leaves her usual, self-destructive routine and hops in his cab for a road trip. Japan’s highways are not pretty and its winter landscape is not always the delicate woodblock print scenes you may know, but this book shows both in their supreme mundanity as Rei journeys to the deep north with a stranger, and further into herself.Only half of this book takes place in Japan. That’s because every other chapter is set somewhere that exists (or doesn’t exist) called the “The End of the World”, whose inhabitants are poignantly mindless, perhaps soulless even. Every chapter in between, on the other hand, is set an alternate Tokyo, “Hard-Boiled Wonderland”, in which the narrator works as a sort of human data-processing machine. It’s a head-scratcher of a story. The nameless narrator spends a memorable portion of the novel below ground, in a monstrous kind of sewer system crawling with up-to-date kappa (amphibious demons of Japanese folklore), emerging from this secret subterranean labyrinth at Aoyama-itchōme station, one of a handful of Tokyo locations name-dropped throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013864de9db0abfcb98ca8eeae44f8d609c9503c/42_519_6507_3904/master/6507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f0662460816228035751f6f62aac2f4","title":"timmy mallett childrens tv what he did next interview","story":"A huge children’s TV star in the 1980s, Mallett is now an artist and has written a new memoir. It charts the bike ride he took, inspired by his older brother, who had Down’s syndrome and lived an extraordinarily rich lifeChildren’s television presenters occupy a strange place in one’s memory, somewhere between grandparents and primary school friendships. They are not mere celebrities, but a part of your childhood, and if you grew up in the 80s and spent most of your time watching TV, as I did, then Timmy Mallett will occupy such a space. In the mid 80s, he was one of the team of presenters of Wide Awake Club, the Saturday-morning children’s show, although it is only Mallett, with his garish clothes and colourful glasses, that I can really remember. He quickly also became the face of the school-holiday show Wacaday. A whole generation of children grew up hitting their siblings over the head with a cushion, or worse, as they recreated his word association game Mallett’s Mallet at home.\u0026nbspMallett, now 64, has written a memoir, following the journey of a two-month bike ride through France and Spain two years ago, taking the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route. The book is punctuated with memories of his life and career, which is why we are talking, on a sunny day in lockdown, over Zoom. Mallett is mostly an artist these days, so life has changed very little.“I suppose going off on a longer adventure would be something I would like to do, and also seeing friends,” he says. But he paints every day, doing a live session on Facebook, where he always appears wearing a different pair of coloured glasses. He recites poetry and stories, and seems utterly delighted with life, even in the middle of lockdown.It’s still spring when we speak, and he has been painting the season. “It’s a magnificent spring,” he says. “Is that a coincidence?” I don’t know, I say – is it objectively more magnificent, or is it that we have slowed down to notice it? “We’re certainly noticing it. This is a spring we’ll all remember and there’s never been a brighter, more colourful, more spectacular spring. I was out on my bike doing my bit of daily exercise and I was surprised to see, about a week ago, the horse chestnuts in flower, like candelabra. I’m just noticing colour. Colour, colour, colour.”The inspiration for the Santiago bike adventure was Mallett’s brother Martin, who was two years older than him and died shortly before Mallett set off. Well, the inspiration was Martin, and Mallett’s great heroine, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the 12th-century queen over whose lands he travelled. (Mallett’s book is a fun read – at once a history lesson, travelogue, love letter to cycling, autobiography and motivational manual, with some perhaps unintended but endearingly hilarious lines such as “tarmac is the same all over the world”.)Martin had Down’s syndrome, and his whole life, says Mallett, was about “reaching his potential”. He lived in a supported community in Aberdeen, where he worked in the bakery. Although Martin had early-onset dementia and died at the age of 64, “it’s not the length of your life, it’s the depth and breadth and all the rest of filling it all. And boy, did Martin fill it,” says Mallett.\u0026nbspMallett was the youngest of three boys. “I always knew Martin was different,” he says. “But it was quite useful having a bigger brother who would play the games I wanted to play. For Martin, it was always just about being together, that was the important thing. When he would come to visit us in later years, our Billy’s an only child and he would say: ‘Come on, Uncle Martin, let’s do this.’ ‘Yeah.’ I instantly saw it again, the same pattern. How nice is that, to just have somebody to play with?”The boys grew up in a small town in Greater Manchester, their father working as an artist for a textile company before joining the clergy. Mallett remembers his mother giving talks about being the parent of a “mentally handicapped” child. “That phrase just sounds awful, doesn’t it? She would say: ‘Martin was born a mongol.’ Wow. That’s how people talked about it.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMartin was born in 1953, at a time when it was common for babies with Down’s syndrome to be institutionalised. “Mum and Dad didn’t hide him away,” says Mallett. “They allowed him to make the most he could of his abilities.” There is only one instance that sticks in his mind of Martin being bullied, as the two of them were on their way to Cubs. “A group of kids picked on us. One of the group said: ‘He goes to our school,’ pointing at me, ‘get the other one.’ There was a bit of pushing and shoving and roughing up Martin, and we ran off in tears. And the big Cubs, when they saw us arriving, dishevelled and upset, went out to go and sort out our attackers.\u0026nbspWhether they ever did or not is irrelevant the fact is, Martin was part of the group and they weren’t going to have that.”What Mallett mainly remembers about his brother is how adventurous he was. “He would get lost he always had wanderlust, he was always off exploring. Now that I’m a parent, you know that must have been really worrying. I remember my dad going down to the canal and dreading that moment where he’d have to look over into the lock.” Martin, like other people with Down’s syndrome growing up at that period, was not expected to live for long. Did it feel like that was hanging over the family? Mallett pauses. “I’m not sure it hung over me. I was aware that people said that, and that people with Down’s syndrome don’t necessarily live as long as others, but that’s not really true these days.”Once Mallett and his eldest brother, Paul, left home, their parents would hear Martin talking to himself at night and realised it was time for him to move on with his life, too. He moved to a Camphill community, for people with learning disabilities, in Aberdeen. Mallett is proud of how much financial support Martin received from the local authorities throughout his life. “Are we as good about doing that these days?” he says of the cuts that have hit hardest among people with disabilities.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGrowing up, Mallett wanted, like many children, to be a pop star. “I didn’t think that would actually happen and I would have a No 1 hit around the world,” he says – his single Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini, released by his band Bombalurina, was unavoidable in the summer of 1990. “I mean, that makes me go: ‘Wow, that was a dream I had.’” Was he always a show-off? He laughs. “Yeah. In my book, I talk about our pop group, The Kettle Holders. Paul couldn’t remember the words, Martin couldn’t say the words, so I just made them up and sang them.”By the time he got to Warwick University, to study history, “I knew I wanted to go into broadcasting. I knew I wanted to be a DJ, an entertainer.” He had a university radio show, then got a slot on Radio Oxford, and then at Manchester’s Piccadilly Radio, where a series of helpers included the young Chris Evans, Nick Robinson and Brian Cox. When the TV station TV-am launched in 1983, Mallett was brought in to host the children’s shows.\u0026nbsp“I loved it. I liked the fact that it was make it up as you go along, and try things out. You’d have a week going: ‘Here we are in Blah-lin, in Blah-many.’ You just repeat those gags and it becomes part of the language. Here’s a nice little thing, I’ve got something to show you …” He goes off, and returns a few seconds later with Pinky Punky, the soft toy mallet from the show (Mallett sells them, along with a full range of other themed merchandise, on his website). “He made his first appearance on Wacaday 30 years ago. What soft toy lasts 30 years?”\u0026nbspMy sister and I used to play endless games of Mallett’s Mallet, I say. “Good!” He says it’s “lovely” that there is a whole generation who have fond memories of him. “It also reminds me that, you know, there’s a responsibility here.” The other show I loved, I say, was Jim’ll Fix It, presented by Jimmy Savile, whose horrendous serial sex abuse came to light only after he died. Did Mallett ever have any dealings with him? He suddenly goes quiet and serious, a dark cloud passing. “No. No. Never met him.” Were there stories going around in children’s TV circles about him at the time? “No,” says Mallett. “If there were, I never heard them.”\u0026nbspWacaday came to an end in 1992, when TV-am closed. Did he worry about what he would do next? No, he says. He went into TV production, did some panto, some stage shows. For a while he played the student circuit. “I remember thinking: ‘Why would I be being booked for students?’ Well, because little Wideawakers had suddenly grown up and gone to uni.” He wondered if he needed to make Mallett’s Mallet edgier, to entertain a drunken student crowd. “But no, you keep it as wholesome and as lovely as it was when you were eight years old.” He still tours holiday camps, though not this summer. “I guess they’ll come back next year,” he says.\u0026nbspMallett has a wardrobe full of his “original colourful Timmy gear. That’s weird isn’t it?” Does he still wear it? “I do occasionally, yeah. If I’m going on stage and stuff, yes, I would do – it’s funny, isn’t it, to see all those bright and colourful things, but colour has always been a part of who I am. What am I wearing here?” He looks down at his green shirt with darker splodges on it, and takes his glasses (also green) off to see which pair he is wearing today. Does he feel under pressure to perform, in everyday life, as the wacky “Timmy Mallett”? “No. I’m quite comfortable in who I am and what I do and, honestly, it’s not a pressure. I am Timmy Mallett and this is who I am.”There hasn’t been much TV work in recent years – in 2008, he was a contestant on I’m a Celebrity and featured in a Skepta music video – but he says: “I don’t sort of hanker for it. I’ve got a busy life.” What plans does he have? “I’ve got quite a few, but here’s the thing – I haven’t discussed them yet with Mrs Mallett, and I’m very much aware that when I started planning for the Camino, she did mention ‘it would have been nice if you’d asked’.” And, yes, he does call Lynda, his wife of 30 years, Mrs Mallett in real life, he says. “There’s something about ‘Mrs Mallett’. It’s quite respectful and it adds a certain stature to the relationship, if you like. What do you call your partner?” By his name, like a normal person. Mallett smiles.\u0026nbspThe Camino had been planned for a long time before Martin died, he says, although he set off two days after his brother’s funeral. “It wasn’t planned as a grief ride it was planned as a celebration of reaching your potential, with Martin as the inspiration. He knew I was going on the bike ride because I had discussed it with him. I said: ‘I’m going on a bike ride, Martin, a big bike ride.’ ‘You and me,’ he said. Wow. And that’s when I knew that I was going to carry him in my heart.”\u0026nbspThe ride taught him about planning for the unexpected, and a willingness to be vulnerable. “Being vulnerable opens you up to the possibility of acts of random kindness. ‘Be kind to yourself’ – I’ve been hearing that phrase in this lockdown.” The other thing he tried to remember, he says, is “these are the golden years. And, you know, life is a whizz through at a million billion gazillion miles an hour. The important thing to do is to fill every moment, like my dear brother. Reach your potential.

Ducey also also ordered public schools to delay the start of the classes at least until 17 August.“Our expectation is that our numbers next week will be worse,” he said.Arizona health officials reported 3,858 more confirmed coronavirus cases Sunday, the most reported in a single day in the state so far and the seventh time in the last 10 days that daily cases surpassed the 3,000 mark. Since the pandemic began, 74,500 cases and 1,588 deaths stemming from the virus have been reported in Arizona.Most Arizona bars and nightclubs opened after Ducey’s stay-at-home and business closure orders were allowed to expire in mid-May. The state is not alone in its reversal. Places such as Texas, Florida and California are backtracking, closing beaches and bars in some cases amid a resurgence of the virus. Oregon and Kansas, meanwhile, announced Monday that everyone would be required to wear masks in public.In California over the weekend, the governor, Gavin Newsom, ordered bars and nightclubs in nine counties to close, including Los Angeles, which has nearly 100,000 cases – the most of any region of the state.The state is in the midst of trying to “toggle back” plans to reopen as case numbers and hospitalizations flare up in sections of the state. Red flags have been raised on a number of metrics, including “disturbing trendlines” in positivity rates, hospitalizations and ICU admissions.Particularly hard hit is southern California’s Imperial county, where an outbreak is taxing the region’s hospital system. In recent weeks, health officials have had to move roughly 500 patients into neighboring regions, burdening their hospital systems, too.Newsom has urged Imperial county to reissue a stay-at-home order that had been previously lifted, and on Monday leveled the threat of a heavier hand if the county chose not to take the advice.Meanwhile in Texas, a group of bar owners sued on Monday to try to overturn the Republican governor Greg Abbott’s order closing their businesses. They contend Abbott doesn’t have the authority, and they complained that other businesses, such as nail salons and tattoo studios, remain open.Ducey has faced criticism for what fellow lawmakers see as a failure to react to the severity of the crisis. A letter sent by the Democratic congressman Ruben Gallego in mid June chastised the governor for failing to highlight the “seriousness of the growing public health emergency our state is facing”.While Ducey has urged Arizonans to keep their distance from one another in public, he refused to issue a statewide order to wear masks and until recently resisted calls by some cities to allow them to require masks.The move also comes less than a week after Donald Trump visited the Arizona-Mexico border and held a rally in Phoenix in which few people wore masks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef08f2c032d5d9504b64c8efde5bae8c06289c/126_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97f42eeeb9bb8bc0fd637302cfd4506f","title":"have differing approaches to social distancing rules caused issues in your family","story":"We want to hear from people who have experienced issues with family or friends over different approaches to physical distancingThe prime minister has confirmed that the 2-metre rule would be dropped in favour of a “1-metre-plus” approach, as people from two different households will be able to drink or dine together from 4 July in England.However, those who are more at risk or vulnerable may choose to continue to maintain the 2-metre rule or wear face masks or gloves.We want to hear from people who have experienced any issues with friends or family over different approaches to physical distancing.We are keen to hear from more than one person in the same familycouplefriendship group, if they have differing views.

Belgium ceded control of the vast territory, soon after Patrice Lumumba, a charismatic independence, leader became Congo’s first democratic prime minister. Lumumba was assassinated in 1961 by Congolese rebels and Belgian army officers on the orders of the CIA, with the tacit support of the Belgian government.Martin Fayulu, a respected opposition politician in the DRC, said it was never too late to recognise past wrongdoing and called for reparations from Belgium.“If they recognise now what they did here than that’s all to the good, but these can’t just be words because that’s what it’s fashionable to say at the moment. But that’s the past. It’s what they do now that matters.”Fayulu, the leader of the Engagement for Citizenship and Development party, said the anniversary of independence made him angry. Many observers believe the 63-year-old veteran politician easily won elections held in 2018 but was excluded from power by the current president, Félix Tshisekedi. Fayulu rejected the official tally, saying it was the product of a secret deal between Tshisekedi and the outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, to cheat him out of a clear win. “The looting of the Congo has never stopped. Our resources are stolen, our people remain in misery, we are ruled by dictators and thieves. The international powers say they need to be pragmatic. And look where we are.”Tshisekedi, who heads a coalition government, has called for a day of “meditation” rather than celebration, and will address the nation on Tuesday.Josue Cibwabwa, 28, a shopkeeper and pro-democracy activist in Mbuji-Mayi in the Kasai-Oriental province, said the call for “meditation” was welcome.“Congolese people should really ask themselves what their country will become in the future. Citizens should be ask more from their leaders. The DRC is at a crossroads,” Cibwabwa said.Jerome Ongome, an 86-year-old retired teacher living in Bukavu, told the  politicians had promised “heaven on earth” once Congo was free of colonial rule.“Before independence, our politicians promised … Congolese would drive cars and get higher salaries. I am now retired without driving or any income,” he said.“I remember my father saying the exploiters were leaving. There was a sense among the people of Congo that suffering had ended.”David Luta, a student from Fizi in South Kivu province, said, despite the irregularities surrounding the election last year, he was happy there seemed now to be “a political plan for the future”.“The fact that Kabila transferred power peacefully to Felix Tshisekedi give us young generation hope for the future,” Luta, 23, said.Despite massive natural wealth, including vast deposits of valuable minerals and precious metals, the DRC continues to suffer from deep poverty, widespread violence and disease.The king’s letter contrasts with the recent remarks of his younger brother, Prince Laurent, who said he did not see how Léopold II could have been responsible for widely reported atrocities in the Congo Free State because he never set foot in the country.Belgian commentators have been struck with the contrast with King Philippe’s predecessors, who ignored colonial violence. At an independence day event in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) on 30 June 1960, King Baudouin declared that Congo’s self determination was “the outcome of the work conceived by Léopold II”, while praising his ancestor’s “tenacious courage” as “not a conquerer but a ‘civiliser’.”Echoing some of the king’s words, Belgium’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, called for recognition of past suffering, without making an official apology. “As with other European countries, the time has come for Belgium to embark on the path of research, truth and memory.”The death of George Floyd in the US has rekindled anti-racism protests in Belgium, prompting the federal parliament to set up a ‘truth and reconciliation’ commission to “come clean” about the country’s colonial past.Belgian politicians suggested the king’s statement stopped short of an apology, because he did not want to preempt the commission’s work.Belgian anti-racism campaigners had set 30 June as a deadline to remove all statutes of Léopold II. Across Belgium, colonial-era monuments and busts have been toppled, burned or daubed with red paint or slogans in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. While few have been officially removed, the city of Brussels has promised a public debate on the monuments, which will include the Congolese diaspora.One Brussels politician who has been campaigning for better understanding of Belgium’s colonial legacy said it was “too early” for royal apologies. “I think that the king did well not to apologise immediately,” Kalvin Soiresse, a Green deputy in the Brussels region parliament, told Belgium’s Francophone public broadcaster RTBF. “The parliamentary work is necessary to establish the facts. It is after the establishment of the facts that we can talk about apologies or reparation.”Soiresse, who was born in Togo, also spoke of how he had received racist abuse because of his work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b746f0475c07346c14e949d08570c44343350dbe/0_153_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03f4bc25989b6754efce4304a1f65c06","title":"coronavirus fauci senate states reverse reopening","story":"The top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci testified before the Senate on the government’s coronavirus efforts on Tuesday, as cases continue to soar and states around the country reverse their reopening efforts.He did so after the White House insisted the outbreak had been reduced to “embers” but after the principal deputy director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr Anne Schuchat, insisted: “This is really the beginning.”“What we hope is that we can take it seriously and slow the transmission,” Schuchat told the Journal of the American Medical Association, adding: “We have way too much virus across the country for that right now, so it’s very discouraging.Schuchat added that there was “a lot of wishful thinking around the country” that the pandemic would be over by the summer.“We are not even beginning to be over this,” Schuchat said. “There are a lot of worrisome factors about the last week or so.“We’re not in the situation of New Zealand or Singapore or Korea, where a new case is rapidly identified and all the contacts are traced and people are isolated who are sick and people who are exposed are quarantined and they can keep things under control.”On Capitol Hill, Fauci and other senior advisers were to offer an update to the health committee on progress in allowing Americans to return to work and school. Congress is reportedly weighing sending a second round of stimulus checks to Americans, with the US firmly in a recession and unemployment claims historically high.The US has recorded more than 2.5m confirmed cases, with some states seeing record rises. On Monday the governor of Arizona ordered bars, movie theaters, gyms and water parks to shut down for a month, weeks after reopening.Texas, Florida and California, all seeing rises in Covid-19 cases, have rolled back reopening efforts. Oregon and Kansas have ordered people to wear masks in public.New daily cases are rising in 38 states, according to NPR’s pandemic tracker, but the White House continues its attempts to downplay the severity of Covid-19. At a briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany ignored the surge.“The people who are being infected tend to be those – as Vice-President Pence has noted – half of those testing positive are under the age of 35. This means we’re catching people in their communities,” she said.She added: “We’re aware that there are embers that need to be put out.”Fauci said on Sunday the US was unlikely to achieve herd immunity to the coronavirus even with a vaccine, given a third of Americans say they would not receive it.“There is a general anti-science, anti-authority, anti-vaccine feeling among some people in this country – an alarmingly large percentage of people, relatively speaking,” Fauci said, adding that the government has “a lot of work to do” to educate people about vaccines.Even states where the rate of new infections has decreased are rethinking plans to allow businesses to reopen. New Jersey has postponed plans to allow indoor dining, while the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said he may reverse plans to allow restaurants and bars to reopen.Broadway theaters will remain closed until January 2021, an industry group said on Monday. Theaters had planned to reopen in September.People in the US are expected to be barred from non-essential travel to the European Union when it releases a “safe list” of countries on Tuesday. Russia and Brazil, each experiencing rising coronavirus cases, are among the other countries to be excluded from the list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

At least 1,000 slaves died on board.Records show that the mortality rate for the enslaved men, women and children transported on the Beeckestijn was as high as a third during some of the ship’s long and arduous transatlantic voyages.The drawing is part of the Amsterdammers and Slavery exhibition being staged from Wednesday at the city archives to mark the 157th anniversary of the end of slavery in the colonies of Suriname and the Dutch Antilles. Abolition, after 200 years of the trade, was announced on 1 July 1863.The print of the Beeckestijn in the Prins Hendrikkade docks, drawn by the draftsman Hendrik de Leth, is well-known and is part of a number of collections.But the fact that the Beeckestijn was a slave ship had not been recognised until the recent discovery of the vessel’s records by historian Mark Ponte, who is curating the archive’s exhibition.“It is the first 18th century print of a Dutch West India Company ship that we know of,” Ponte told the . “This print has been widely spread - this copy was in the Amsterdam city archives collection - and if you don’t know you wouldn’t be able to tell that it is a slave ship.“I was looking for material about the West India warehouses and the ship is in front of the warehouses on Amsterdam’s harbour front,” he said. “I put the name in a database and discovered it was a slave ship based in Amsterdam on which more than a thousand died.”The Dutch West India Company had a monopoly on trade in the Dutch West Indies and was also given jurisdiction over the Atlantic slave trade by the then Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.Records show that on WIC Beeckestijn’s first voyage, under captain Dirk de Wolf, the ship and its 63 crew left the Dutch port of Texel on 19 February 1721. The ship was mounted with 26 guns.A cohort of 615 slaves was bought from northern Congo on 29 April and the ship arrived with them to disembark at the Caribbean island colony of St Eustatius almost a year later on 3 April 1722.The records show that only 560 of 615 survived the journey to work on the plantations. The ship then set sail for the Netherlands on 6 August.The ship’s most murderous journey, however, came after the ship left Texel for Elmina, a port on the coast of what is now Ghana on 15 April 1730.The vessel, then captained by Andries Graan, picked up 753 slaves from the west African port before leaving for Suriname on 18 February 1731.The exhibition about Amsterdam’s deep links with the slave trade will also feature the stories of 13 characters who were involved, including those who profited and those who were sold as property.“The city of Amsterdam is currently researching its own involvement in the slave trade and that is why we wanted to do this exhibition,” Ponte said. “We started work on this long before the recent strong Black Lives Matter protests – but it makes it even more relevant of course.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285251.1592819773!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"twelve things covid 19 has taught us about education and schooling","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSchool plays a fundamental role in our broader society, supporting children to thrive and flourish in a holistic way. Photograph: iStockAs the school year draws to a close, it is an opportune time to reflect on what we have learned about education and schooling over the past few months. While there is a sense that everyone is fed up, the uncertainty of what is to come with the physical reopening of schools weighs heavily on many people’s minds.The physical closure of schools during the lockdown has presented many challenges. It has evoked a range of responses initially characterised by an appreciation for our teachers and the work they do, to a more recent rhetoric of criticism and frustration that teachers and schools are doing too much or not doing enough. It is the stuff of rock and hard place.Many children have struggled for a variety of reasons. They miss their friends, teachers and SNAs and, no matter how hard we try, a Zoom call with 30 children quickly descends into disorganised chaos filled with the joy of seeing each other and the frustration of not being able to speak and interact with friends in a really dynamic way.It has been well documented by organisations such as the Children’s Rights Alliance that children who are particularly vulnerable within our society have been especially impacted by school closures, including those living in poverty, children who have additional needs and those who require specialised support and care.Very quickly the digital ide has emerged, with profound implications for students who don’t have access to the technology, wifi or digital literacy required to engage with online schooling. Many students are grappling with additional care responsibilities limiting their ability to engage in learning.There are symbolic occasions along the educational journey that are considered rites of passage, moments of transition, marking and celebrating with the wider community how our young people are progressing within the education system. Children will now engage in transitions (such as into primary school, from junior to senior school, from primary to secondary school) missing out on the traditional celebrations, preparations and rituals. This is no more evident than marking the end of primary and secondary education where graduation ceremonies bring communities together to celebrate young people’s achievements and to prepare them for this formative step into the future.So, what has Covid-19 taught us about education and schooling?1. School is more than a physical building. It is the heart of a community. It is the fulcrum which draws us together on a daily basis. School plays a fundamental role in our broader society, supporting children to thrive and flourish in a holistic way. It defines the fibre of who we are as Irish citizens and how we understand ourselves, and our rights, within the broader globalised world.2. Relational and socioemotional dynamics comprise the fabric of schooling. Schools and classrooms are fundamentally embedded within the complexity of the relational. Teachers care deeply. The work of teachers and SNAs is deeply embedded within the relational and emotional work of building, nurturing and supporting relationships. These relationships are so important in supporting children’s learning and holistic development through a pedagogy of empathy. As hard as many have tried, this is extremely challenging to replicate through the school virtual learning environment. The work of curriculum cannot be effectively realised when detached from the relational.3. Education and schooling is innately pastoral with care and empathy at its core. This has most recently been evidenced in the outreach activities of schools delivering food parcels, resources and social and emotional support to children and their families. Much of the work undertaken by teachers and SNAs in our classrooms is embedded within this ethic of care and empathy. Schools are particularly conscious of supporting children’s wellbeing as they transition back into the classroom in August.4. Performativity holds higher status than process. John Dewey, a prominent educational reformer, stated that “education is not preparation for life education is life itself”. Yet the evidence of what has been achieved by our students and teachers is measured using performative aspects of education. This ranges from the use of predictive grades in the Leaving Certificate to evaluating interactions and portfolios through online platforms. Although there is an increasing emphasis on continuous assessment, it is still summative assessment which garners most weight and power in deciding children and young people’s trajectory within the education system.5. Deis is an essential resource for supporting our most vulnerable communities. This scheme has, without doubt, proven its worth during the pandemic. Schools working under the Deis scheme have supported children and their families, not only in terms of their engagement with learning, but also in terms of providing food, pastoral care and emotional support as communities grapple to cope in this profoundly changed environment. The widening gap in attainment that will emerge from school closures will be profound, impacting not only in terms of learning and socioemotional outcomes, but also in terms of future life experiences and opportunities. Greater and sustained investment in Deis will be required to further support schools as they negotiate the pandemic with their pupils and communities.6. Collaboration between schools and support services is crucial. Schools are at the epicentre of our children’s lives. Outside of familial and care networks, schools are where children spend the majority of their time as they negotiate their childhoods. They become important sites for identifying and supporting any additional needs pupils might have. In order to ensure cohesion to support the needs of children it is imperative that there are adequate support services available and that they adopt a collaborative and integrative approach with schools.7. Schooling at distance is highly problematic. Notwithstanding the above discussion, engaging children in school work at a distance creates a deep educational chasm. Not only does it ide teachers from pupils, it serves to create fractures in how we understand teaching and learning within our broader society. Classrooms have suddenly become public property, a free for all, open to critique based on assumptions rather than on deep pedagogical understanding. Connectedness plays an integral role in engaging children in learning in school and yet the screen often becomes a barrier between the learner and their wider learning community. The more removed the emotional and relational aspect of learning, the greater the distance between school and the learner.8. Daily interactions are fundamental to learning in school. Children’s friendships and their relationships with their teachers and SNAs are critical to supporting their positive experience in school. The greeting at the door, the smile on the corridor, the high-five, the positive affirmation, the nod of reassurance all play an important role in signalling children’s sense of belonging and achievement in school. These informal interactions are as important as the structured lesson planning and delivery of resources. They contribute to children’s sense of learner identity while building their confidence for engaging in the classroom.9. Learning should be fun to foster creativity and innovation. Engaging children in fun, self-directed activities allows them to explore, take risks, build confidence and learn new skills ultimately fostering their creativity and innovation. The importance of creativity and innovation has emerged as especially important for problem solving during the pandemic. It is important that we don’t lose playfulness or fun in education and school.10. It is inequitable to make assumptions about learner access to resources at home. We cannot assume children have equal access to resources to engage in learning at home. This includes equipment (such as printers, laptops, stationary), place (a table to work at) and time to learn (especially if they have additional carework responsibilities).11. Technology enables and excludes learners. Technology has emerged as a really important lifeline for us all during the pandemic. It has enabled schools to contact and engage with pupils in myriad ways and on an array of platforms. Indeed, at this point in time we are all well and truly Zoomed, Seesawed, Kahooted, Padleted and Aladdined out. However, it has also served to exclude, particularly those who do not have the resources (laptop, wifi, software) or digital literacy they need to meaningfully engage. Such a paradox is inequitable and requires urgent attention.12. A positive and open relationship between home and school is imperative. The pandemic has truly exposed the absolute importance of a positive and open relationship between home and school. New ways of communicating during school closures has establishedstrengthened the foundation upon which these relationships can be nurtured into the future. To do so is to enhance the learning experiences of our children at home and in school.This list is by no means exhaustive, but it seeks to open up the conversation not only about the purpose of education, but about its value and importance within Irish society. In his recent address to sixth class pupils, President Michael D Higgins stated that “school is where we learn how to be part of a community and, most importantly, how to include others in that sense of community, by being kind and supportive and generous”.Rather than looking to schools and school leaders for the answer, maybe it is time for us to reach out in the community, in the spirit of the true Irish meitheal, and ask what can we do to help support schools and teachers as they now face into the difficult and challenging task of physically reopening their doors and classrooms in August. Coming together in this way can only help support a thriving and flourishing school community.In the words of my seven-year-old in an email to his teacher, “I’m really really really really excited about seeing you after this is all over”. I have no doubt the feeling is mutual.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revolt"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292493.1593517320!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"call for government to cancel flights follows holohan s foreign travel ","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers arriving in Dublin Airport earlier this month. Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally said international travel should not be encouraged at this time. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinIrish Travel Agents Association chief executive has said the new Government should move to cancel flights so people who have booked foreign trips can get their money back.Giving permission to fly and yet saying not to fly was unfair, Pat Dawson said.He also called for clarity on so-called air bridges. Under the Government’s air bridges plan, it was understood Irish tourists could go on foreign holidays from July 9th to other countries that have brought coronavirus under control.Mr Dawson’s comments come after chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said people who had booked overseas trips should not travel at present due to the risk to themselves, their families and wider society.Asked on Monday whether people should cancel their summer holidays abroad, Dr Holohan said public health officials would like them not to travel in their inidual interest and in the collective interest.Mr Dawson told RTÉ Radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show on Tuesday there were three important issues that needed to be addressed before travel could return to normal: safety in airports, safety on airlines and up-to-date information on countries it is safe to visit because they have low Covid-19 rates.Mr Dawson added he is encouraging people to postpone their holidays to the end of this year or next year.Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally told the same programme he did not think air bridges were the solution and that there was in fact no real solution other than to “get rid of the virus in Ireland”.Ireland should follow the example of countries like New Zealand and introduce strict quarantine measures for people arriving into the country, he said, adding there were enough hotels near the airports to do this.Dr Scally said he agreed with the concerns raised by Dr Holohan about travel. “The last thing we want is people going off on holiday and then bringing back the virus or find themselves in the midst of a flare-up.”People could find themselves “stuck” abroad with no insurance cover, Dr Scally\u0026nbspsaid, adding this should be the year people holiday in Ireland. “That’s the right thing to do. The country has done well so far – we shouldn’t encourage international travel.”If there were zero cases in Ireland it would mean people could travel around the country with fewer restrictions, he added. The current system of self isolating was not strong, and the Government should introduce compulsory quarantine. That was the only safe way, he said.Virologist Dr Kim Roberts agreed on the issue of compulsory quarantine. She said international travel was a privilege and people needed to value that privilege and the only way to have control was to have restrictions. “If people abuse them then we will be back to lockdown,” she warned.Dr Roberts said young people seemed to think they were bulletproof and could pass on the virus to others while not experiencing symptoms themselves. If there was compulsory quarantine then people would be in a place where they could be monitored.For people who survive Covid that was “just the beginning of the journey – there are long lasting health implications,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:  Charles McQuillanGettyThe booths along the window seats at the Elephant \u0026amp Castle restaurant in Churchtown, south Dublin were busy before lunchtime on Monday with perspex screens safely separating each.At the back of the restaurant, tables were further apart, at two metres. Similar measures were in place as restaurants, pubs serving food and hotels across the country as they opened their doors again in the third reopening phase after more than three months of lockdown from Covid-19.Under health guidelines to protect against coronavirus, restaurants are advised to maintain two metres between tables but if this is not possible, it can be reduced to one metre in controlled environments if pre-booked time-limited slots of a maximum of 90 minutes are followed.So has the public health advice on the two metre rule changed?No, not for the time being, according to health specialists.“It is likely to become more difficulty as more people are out and about but certainly two metres remains the recommendation and is our preferred approach because we know that the greater the distance the lower the risk,” said Cillian De Gascun, director of UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory.The World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 has said that a two-metre distance offers 99 per cent protection and that this falls to 70 per cent at one metre, so neither option is without risk. Northern Ireland’s Stormont Executive has said that people should keep two metres apart where possible but agreed that from Monday last one-metre distancing would suffice where appropriate mitigations can be made.Arlene Foster, the Northern Irish First Minister, said that “nothing is risk-free” and said that the move to one metre was possible if other risk mitigations were in place. She cited the hospitality and tourism sectors in her decision.De Gascun, chairman of the expert advisory group to the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team, said the advice in the State remained that where a distance of only one metre could be maintained, such as in shops, on public transport or in busy spaces, a face covering should be worn.The limits of even the one metre rule have been made clear, mostly notably by the last minister for education Joe McHugh who warned about reduced class attendances and sizes when students start returning to school in the autumn. One teachers’ union has even warned about strike action if schools do not reopen in line with public health advice or there is a risk to health and safety.Health specialists say that the response to the pandemic in the country has moved to a phase of personal responsibility where people must make their own risk-based choices. “We are moving away from a one-size-fits-all rule-based system to one of inidual risk analysis and inidual responsibility and different rules and different situations,” said Prof Sam McConkey, an infectious diseases specialist at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. “It is no longer a one-size-fits-all. I know the teachers were struggling with that.” He accepts the public health message is “much more complicated” than three months ago because it is now coming down to inidual choices.“The two metres are definitely better than one but there are things you just can’t do with two metres and those things are very important to us,” he said, citing close contacts with family members outside a household, children returning to school and healthcare for patients.Dr De Gascun said that Nphet accepts that one metre distancing will only be possible in some settings but that it will have to assess how the virus is behaving. He does not want to pre-empt Nphet’s decision-making process but says that he does not anticipate any major changes to guidance on distancing until the country is well into phase four of the reopening after July 20th. “If we get no resurgence in activity and we feel that the levels of virus circulating in the community are very low and it is still perceived that there is an economic impact to the two metre guidance, well then that can be reviewed,” he said.The ideal scenario is to try to eliminate the virus by getting to the point where Ireland has had 28 days - or two incubation periods of the virus- of no new unexplained community transmissions. “If we had that, then we could more or less do a very widespread opening up. It might not even be down to one metre. It might be down to zero metres,” said Prof McConkey.That, however, is still some time away with 24 new infections reported on Monday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"John Alex Kane was seen near showrooms and lock on door was later observed to have been allegedly forced, court toldOne strand of the investigation is use of food trade, particularly Chinese restaurantsReport on first year of new law\u0026rsquos operation is laid before the Houses of the OireachtasTravel agents chief says situation is unfair and calls for clarity on \u0026lsquoair bridges\u0026rsquoPools of blood, bodies left for days and looting - why has this painful period been forgotten?Garda investigating suspected drugs trafficking, money laundering searched properties in Cavan and DublinGuidelines say crew should live in \u0026lsquocontrolled environment\u0026rsquo as production resumesNon-career diplomat Ann Derwin moved to the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2017Parliamentary Budget Office expresses concern over plan for more pandemic fundingTaoiseach says role of chief whip is extremely important in a \u0026lsquotripartite Government\u0026rsquoBallot papers will be sent out to party members in the first week of July, with July 22nd the final date for the return of ballotsThink-tank says greener future possible if the country is willing to learn the lessons pandemicJourney brought Tipperary native from Silicon Valley to lead diocese which includes Co CavanDo it for Dan campaign had raised over \u0026euro3 million for lifesaving treatment in the USMinister for Justice Helen McEntee reiterates commitment to review of security lawsLack of northern appointment to Seanad \u0026lsquovery unfortunate\u0026rsquo, Michelle O\u0026rsquoNeill saysHistorical documents burnt in Four Courts attack have been digitally restoredStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291999.1593467893!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government plan for extra 2bn covid 19 fund criticised over lack of detail","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Government is to ask the Oireachtas to approve almost €2 billion in additional funding for the health service this week to deal with the Covid-19 emergency.The Government is also to look for authorisation for an increased allocation of €483 million for jobs and enterprise development.The revised spending authorisation, if approved by the Oireachtas, will see expenditure on health exceed €20 billion for the first time.However, further supplementary funding for the health service may be required later in the year, a report by the Parliamentary Budget Office in the Oireachtas has suggested. It is critical of a lack of detail from Government on how the additional funding will be spent.“The HSE generates its own income. If the pandemic reduces the income of the HSE in 2020 below what has been budgeted for, a supplementary estimate may be necessary on that basis alone.”Further funding could also be needed if there is a second surge in the number of coronavirus cases.The deferral of treatment for patients during the pandemic and the increase in waiting lists may result “in a significant knock-on effect on non-pandemic public healthcare spending later in 2020 and into 2021”, the report also warns.It suggests two significant components will be the roughly €320 million for personal protective equipment (PPE) and the estimated €115 million per month cost of taking over private hospitals to provide additional capacity during the peak of the pandemic.“The lack of any detail on pandemic-related spending beyond labelling three subheads is of some concern, in particular when considered alongside the absence of context and impact indicators and performance metrics related to the pandemic.”Overseas travelSeparately, as hairdressers, pubs serving food, churches and creches reopened yesterday, public health officials doubled down on their opposition to any loosening of overseas travel rules, with chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan saying holidaymakers should cancel their bookings.Asked whether people should cancel their summer holidays abroad, Dr Holohan urged them not to travel in their own inidual and the collective interest.No new deaths of patients with Covid-19 were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Monday but another 24 new confirmed cases of the disease were recorded. Nine of the cases involved people under 35, and six involved foreign travel.One cluster required testing for over 20 contacts of the original case, who had travelled to Iraq from the northwest.‘Worrying’ trendsDr Holohan said public health officials were beginning to see some “worrying” new trends, with the number of reported cases increasing and some new clusters.On the issue of travel restrictions and the potential to ease the two-week quarantine rules for those arriving from outside the island of Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said a “substantive decision will be taken on that” at a future Cabinet meeting.“We would look at European methodology around this in terms of a science-based approach,” he said.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said: “We can’t seal off the country.”“We are in a Common Travel Area with the UK, we have a Border with the North and there are still flights coming in at the moment. But we will have to manage the risk, which is the key thing here and it is a risk.“We are going to have to be very careful in terms of Covid as it flares up and act quickly in local areas,” Mr Ryan added. He said people should continue to restrict “travel to when it is absolutely necessary” and encouraged people to holiday domestically this summer rather than travel abroad. Gobally the Covid-19 pandemic is “actually speeding up” WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday.“We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives.

Photograph: Damien EagersPA WireTánaiste Leo Varadkar has questioned the large numbers in the construction industry still getting the pandemic unemployment payment, despite the increased level of building activity.He said there is something “not right” about the numbers in the sector in receipt of the payment.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that construction activity had been back for six weeks and “we are told that 80 per cent of sites are now open”. But he said “there are still 45,000 construction workers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment. “There is something not right there. I do not know what it is, but we need to dig down into that and get people back on site.”Mr Varadkar is Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and his department will take over Employment Affairs, which had been part of the Social Protection portfolio.He was responding to Green Party TD Neasa Hourigan who called for supports to get those on low incomes back to work and to assist labour intensive work “particularly in the building industry, rather than what we tended to do in past recessions, which was to focus on large-scale investment projects”.They were speaking during a debate on revised Estimates for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.Mr Varadkar pledged that the July stimulus package the Government is preparing will be “radical and far reaching” and of a scale to meet the challenge facing businesses and the economy.He also said the Government would decide “in the next couple of days” whether to appeal the High Court judgment that legislation making a sectoral employment order in the electrical industry was unconstitutional.Mr Varadkar opened the debate on the revised Estimates for his department which is seeking authorisation for an additional €483 million in funding to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.Later today the Government will also seek approval for the authorisation of almost €2 billion in additional funding for the Department of Health, bringing expenditure to over €20 billion.The Tánaiste said there was “no time to waste”, more needed to be done and it would be outlined in the July stimulus programme. He also said there would be additional measures when the economic recovery plan is launched in October.Mr Varadkar also referred to Budget 2020 which he said “recognised the potentially disastrous effects of a No Deal Brexit” through provision of a contingency fund in such an event.He warned that the “possibility of no agreement cannot be ruled out” and the contingency fund “may well be required and will have to be given further consideration in the months ahead”.The revised funding for the department will bring total expenditure from €970.9 million in the original estimate to over €1.4 billion, including €1.115 billion in capital funding.Sinn Féin spokeswoman Imelda Munster said her party would support the Estimates but she believed there was “no sense of urgency” from Government to deal with the need for adequate grant aid and interest-free easily applied for loans for those not in a in a position to borrow. Fianna Fail’s Niall Collins said the temporary wage subsidy scheme should be tapered off over time and “not just come to a shuddering end”. He said the “warehousing of tax liabilities” would have to be made available to the business sector.Labour’s Ged Nash criticised the 5 per cent and 6 per cent interest rates on loans that the Government was packaging as “supports” when what they urgently needed were grants and loans at near zero interest rates.“This strategy is akin to handing a drowning person an anchor instead of a lifebuoy. They will simply sink,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Risks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedMove expected to trigger counter-measures from the US and other western countriesWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Some 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th.

These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

These crimes will be clearly defined in the law, she said.We will only target an extremely small minority of people who have breached the law, while the life and property, basic rights and freedoms of the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong residents will be protected.Ms Lam also confirmed that the law would come in to effect today.The top decision-making body of the Chinese legislature voted unanimously to adopt the Hong Kong national security legislation on Tuesday, the official Xinhua news agency reported.The Standing Committee of China\u0027s National People\u0027s Congress also adopted a decision to list the law in Annex III to Hong Kong\u0027s Basic Law, the city\u0027s mini-constitution, Xinhua reportedBeijing says the law banning subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces is needed to return stability to Hong Kong after a year of angry pro-democracy protests.Opponents fear it will demolish the business hub\u0027s cherished political freedoms and hollow out its autonomy given similar laws are used to crush dissent on the authoritarian mainland.In an unprecedented move, Beijing bypassed Hong Kong\u0027s legislature to pass the law, which was signed off just six weeks after it was first announced.Hong Kong\u0027s 7.5 million residents have yet to see the contents of the law.Authorities in Beijing said for the small minority who endanger national security, this law will be a sword hanging over their heads.But for the vast majority of Hong Kong residents and foreigners in Hong Kong, this law is a  spirit that protects their freedoms, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said.In response, EU leaders decried the new law. We deplore the decision, EU Council President Charles Michel told reporters following a video summit with South Korea\u0027s president.The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the bloc is now discussing with international partners on any possible measures in response.Rights groups, many western governments and the United Nations\u0027 rights body have expressed alarm over the law.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news eu puts 14 countries safe list excludes us","story":"Canada made the list of 14 safe non-EU countriesWhich countries will the UK announce an air bridge with?

A plague of locusts has landed in Argentina and is wreaking havoc on corn plantations.A handful of hardy travel firms have been sending intrepid Britons to FCO no-go zones for years, Oliver Smith reports.Wild Frontiers, for example, in business since 2002, has the likes of Algeria, Pakistan, Sudan and the DRC on its route map, and the company’s trips often feature regions the FCO would rather you avoided. So how does it find insurance for its clients?Jonny Bealby, the firm’s founder, explains:“We’ve been running trips that contravene FCO advice ever since we started – though not as much as we used to, as lots of countries have become more FCO-friendly is recent years.“As a general rule of thumb, a standard insurance policy will become entirely invalid the moment you put a fingernail into an FCO red zone – even if you take it out straight away. How they prove it is another matter, but that’s the rules. “However, we have a specialist, Travel and General, that offers bespoke insurance so we can visit the riskier places. Our policies have three levels: Standard – for when there’s no incursion into FCO dodgy bits, Improved – for when a trip spends a little time in a no-go zone, and Elite – that’s for holidays to Afghanistan and suchlike.“In terms of price: if the clients are under 65, it’s still pretty reasonable. It then roughly doubles (as most policies do) for over 65s, and doubles again for over 75s.” Read the full article, here.On Sunday, Priti Patel said the Government would announce the first set of air bridges in the coming days. So it is likely we will know today or tomorrow.The first group of air bridges is expected to be a selection of popular destinations with low infection rates – a bid to “re-fire” the Mediterranean tourist economy from July 6, according to government sources.Once the announcement has been made, families will finally be able to start planning their summer breaks. It is expected that the FCO’s indefinite warning against all-but-essential travel, in place since March, will also be lifted. However, some popular destinations could also miss out, due to the rising rate of Covid-19.A second, larger set of countries will then be unveiled later in July, including business destinations in Europe and “low-risk” Caribbean islands which Public Health England has identified as having minimal infections. There is also talk of one long-haul “air bridge”, although this comes with complications around transiting in stop-over countries that the UK does not have an air bridge with. So which countries are set to be announced?  Here we take a look.The National Gallery in London will re-open on July 8, with a regime of social distancing and three one-way routes which will – between them – take in most of the key galleries and all the major paintings, Nick Trend reports.National Gallery will reopen next weekSome of these have been rehung to make them accessible.

And therefore, because children can transmit the disease – even though they are highly unlikely to get ill from the disease – we think the safest thing to do is close the schools.The reason I said what I did about Leicester is that it is an unusually high incidence in children in Leicester.The Health Secretary\u0027s comments come the day after he announced that stricter restrictions would come into force in the East Midlands city following a surge in virus cases.Leicester City Council said 944 Covid-19 cases had been reported in the last two weeks. They account for one in 10 positive tests across the whole of England, in a city with a population of about 330,000.Mr Hancock said the new Leicester lockdown had been introduced after targeted action at factories and workplaces had failed. Four schools had been ordered to close in the previous week, but schools across the city will now be shut from Thursday.He added: We have been monitoring it incredibly closely, we have put in extra testing units, some of the schools in Leicester were closed already.We also went into some of the factories and workplaces where there was an outbreak and we put in place measures. These sorts of much more targeted measures have worked in other outbreaks. So we\u0027ve been taking this highly localised approach, but unfortunately that targeted action wasn\u0027t working in Leicester and that\u0027s why we have taken this much broader measure.Asked about possible causes of the spike in cases, including poverty, higher ethnic ersity, language difficulties and higher-density housing, Mr Hancock said: We are still doing the work to understand exactly why the outbreak has been so bad in Leicester. But lots of the reasons that you mentioned just then are familiar to me, and people will find them intuitive.He said that of course the Government was looking at similar places, but stressed that the coronavirus outbreak in Leicester was very significantly worse than in the next worst-hit area.Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said fingers should not be pointed at local people for not following guidance, and nor should it be suggested that an area\u0027s ersity was to blame.She added: Let\u0027s be clear – the restrictions being reintroduced are not the fault of the local population. There is no evidence that their behaviour has been being at odds with other parts of England.Instead, we need to ask real questions about the adequacy of the UK Government\u0027s response to this whole crisis and whether it has, most immediately, failed the people of Leicester. Learning lessons now could avoid other areas experiencing the same consequences, with further damage to children who have recently returned to school and to local businesses that have reopened and now need to close again.Sir Peter said he had been trying for weeks to access data on the level of testing in the city but was only given access last Thursday.Asked whether a local lockdown should have been brought in earlier, he said: If, as seems to be the case, the figures suggest there are issues in the city, I would wish that they had shared that with us right from the start and I wish they had taken a more speedy decision rather than leaving it 11 days from the Secretary of State\u0027s first announcement.That\u0027s a long gap – and a long time for the virus to spread.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/26/20/panic-buying.jpg","title":"coronavirus uk economy decline official figures","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.GDP shrank more than previously estimated\u0026nbspbetween January and March, official figures showThe UK economy shrank more than initially thought between January and March as output fell at its fastest pace since 1979.Revised figures from the Office for National Statistics show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the previous three months – more than the 2 per cent that had initially been estimated.While the economy was relatively flat in January and February, new data showed it plunged 6.9 per cent in March compared with the previous month.

Mr Johnson’s plans amount to 0.2 per cent of the UK’s GDP last year.Sir Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrat leader, called Mr Johnson’s announcement “hopelessly inadequate” and said the government needed to introduce a “green job guarantee” with investment to insulate homes, improve green transport and invest in nature.Launching the plan on Tuesday, Mr Johnson referred to the GDP’s “vertiginous fall”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the early days, we were getting all sorts of combinations of swabs and samples, it was ironed out but that did delay things. You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.George Neal, the owner of four hair salons across Leicester, believed his business could survive the coronavirus pandemic – if he was able to reopen in early July. But now a second lockdown has begun, his hopes of survival are fading.“I’ve been saying that the beginning of July is it,” he tells The Independent. “Any longer than that and I don’t know if we can survive.”His business is one of many that, after preparing for the reopening of trade on 4 July, is now facing fresh uncertainty and financial hardship as authorities attempt to grapple with a localised outbreak that has seen 944 cases recorded within the city over the past two weeks. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs the rest of the country moves to take a welcome but tentative step out of lockdown, there is to be no such relief for the 330,000 or so residents of Leicester.Here, the pandemic is still making its presence firmly felt. Indeed, the city has recorded 10 per cent of all positive cases in the country over the past week, while hospital admissions for coronavirus have crept up to between six and 10 a day – compared to around one a day at other hospital trusts.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyIn Neal’s case, his salons were all set to go. From protective screens to social distancing measures, the necessary health protocols were in place. Ten weeks’ worth of appointments had been booked in, with his staff – split into two teams “so that if one were one to contract coronavirus, you don’t lose all employees” – to keep the business open 12 hours a day, seven days a week. Now, any hope of returning to normality has vanished. “It’s going to be a big blow, absolutely,” he says. “Although we’ve got a lot of our staff on furlough, we’ve got to make up for the 20 per cent of what the government scheme doesn’t cover. It’s left us very near to the bone.”It had initially been assumed that current restrictions already in place across the country would simply be extended to contain Leicester’s outbreak, meaning only those businesses within the hospitality and personal services sector would have been affected, leaving the local population free to continue visiting local shops, friends and family.However, the government has reversed many of the freedoms rolled out in recent weeks. Non-essential shops, such as department stores and electronic retailers, have closed from Tuesday, schools will shut to most pupils on Thursday and residents have been advised to stay at home as much as they can while the local lockdown continues. “They’ve gone further than we anticipated they might,” Sir Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, said on Monday. Health secretary Matt Hancock later insisted that the “broader action” was needed. “Targeted action wasn’t working,” he said, explaining that the introduction of additional testing units and visits to local factories and workplaces “unfortunately” had failed to limit the rate of transmission.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After a slight increase in footfall and activity over the past two weeks, the surreal silence that marked the peak of the pandemic has since returned. Among those affected by the new rules, which Hancock has said would be enforced by police in some cases, there was nothing but a sense of deflation.Withers Sports, which has been serving customers just off the high street for more than 75 years, pulled down its shutters again this morning after barely two weeks worth of trade after non-essential shops reopened on 15 June.“It’s heartbreaking,” owner Steve Brett said. “You’ve got businesses that are 80 years plus old. Three months ago you go through all the emotions, the anxiety, the stresses, the concerns. You think are you going to come through this? And now we’re back to this.“It’s horrendous. We’re online as well so it’s not been too bad. But I feel for the restaurants, cafes, pubs.”Like other businesses in the area, Brett is concerned as to whether the government will continue to provide support if Leicester finds itself being repeatedly placed into lockdown over the coming months. “I hope there’s going to be some compensation for this. We’re going to need more help if this keeps on happening.“I understand why, we have to be sensible and safe. I just hope people take heed of this and understand that there are consequences for actions. If people aren’t listening to lockdown rules, then businesses are going to suffer. We just can’t continue like this.”A few streets away, the Rutland \u0026amp Derby Arms stands as quiet as it has been for the past three months. After being informed last Wednesday he could reopen on 4 July, Sam Hagger had been tirelessly working to prepare his pub, along with the three others he owns in Leicester, and “getting the doors open” again.“It’s going to delay the much-needed return of cashflow to our business, because we’ve had no income since March,” he says.“Only two of our four pubs are applicable under the government business grants release scheme. We’ve got pubs that have literally had no income and we’ve paid all our bills, our trade creditors and teams, but it’s left us a little bit light.”Leicester mayor says officials struggled to keep testers in cityBeyond the further loss of revenue from now absent punters, Hagger has also spent money preparing to reopen – all now wasted.“We’ve let the supply chain know we’re going to reopen,” he explains. “Although we won’t open at the same strength we were before lockdown, we’ve obviously let people know that we’re going to start buying certain amount of food we’ve previously bought, and now all of a sudden we’ve come to a grinding halt.”As residents scramble to see how the lockdown will affect them – a map has been drawn to highlight where the restrictions extend to, while a postcode checker is also being developed – there remains a number of unanswered questions hanging over the city: What has driven this outbreak? Why didn’t the government’s preemptive measures work? And how will the lockdown be realistically enforced? The Leicestershire Police Federation on Tuesday demanded urgent clarity from the government over their expected role in enforcing the lockdown.There is also the question of why action has only been taken now, when the government knew 11 days ago that cases were spiking in Leicester, and why local authorities were kept in the dark. “We’ve been struggling to get information from them (the government) about what data they had, what led them to believe there was a particular problem here, and struggling to get them to keep the level of testing in Leicester,” says Soulsby, who claims he received a government email at 1am on Monday with recommendations that the city remain under lockdown.He added he has been trying “for weeks” to access data on the level of testing in the city and was only given access last Thursday.Then there is the concern regarding the disproportionate impact of the virus on local Black and Asian communities. Health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said on Monday that, as a “proudly erse city”, Leicester was “particularly at risk”. Data from the Office for National Statistics has shown that black people are 1.9 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than white people in the UK, while British-Indians are around 1.5 times more likely. A separate report by Public Health England (PHE), published earlier this month, said such disparities may be explained by social and economic inequalities, differing risks at work and the prevalence of conditions such as obesity and diabetes among minority groups.North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen suggested that the city was a “perfect storm”, with younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown restrictions, a large ethnic minority population, multi-generational households and large food processing and garment industries.Although coronavirus outbreaks have already been recorded in a number of slaughterhouses across Europe, including a chicken plant in Wales and meat-packing plant in West Yorkshire, authorities in Leicester have yet to confirm the role played by these densely-populated workplaces in contributing to the city’s high infection rate.Experts have also warned that there is no evidence for rhetoric, espoused by several city residents, that minority groups – whom they alleged had not followed guidance – were to blame. “Let’s be clear – the restrictions being re-introduced are not the fault of the local population. There is no evidence that their behaviour has been being ‘at odds’ with other parts of England.”What the data does suggest, however, is an “unusually high” incidence of coronavirus in children. Hancock said that while work was still being done to understand Leicester’s outbreak, extra testing revealed that a large percentage of under-18s had tested positive for Covid-19, therefore justifying the decision to close local schools.Analysis of 800 local hospital admissions has also revealed that late middle-aged men have been “heavily affected”, along with elderly people, Soulsby said on Tuesday. He added that “BAME communities in general have had somewhat higher rates of admission to hospital than the white community” but were “not outlying with figures from elsewhere.” For now, though, the city remains in the dark over what has passed and what is to come. The only certainty, it seems, is that while Leicester may be the first to find itself subjected to a localised lockdown, it won’t be the last.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They identified a G4 variant of the H1H1 ‘swine flu’ virus strain that caused a deadly pandemic in 2009.Pig farm workers also showed elevated levels of the virus in their blood, found the study’s authors, based at two Chinese universities, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and the University of Nottingham.“Such infectivity greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses,” the researcher wrote.The study noted pigs were important “mixing vessels” for influenza viruses and systemic surveillance of diseases in the animals was “essential for early warning and preparedness for the next potential pandemic”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s the key context to keep in mind,” he said.He added: “Every indication is that the G4 virus would have to undergo some evolutionary change to spread readily in people, and it may never do that. If it does? We know how to make vaccines for influenza viruses. It could be included in the seasonal vaccine the only issue is timing.”The 2009 H1N1 pandemic, thought to have originated in pigs in Mexico, is estimated to have infected more than 700 million people worldwide. It caused nearly 17,000 lab-confirmed deaths reported to the WHO, but the true number of fatalities linked to the disease is believed to have been far higher.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I was never taking James Acaster‘s spot, I was never taking Ed Gamble‘s spot on that show, I was always 100 per cent of the time taking a job away from one of my female peers.”Ryan continued: “I thought, ‘OK, I’ve had my time on this show, I have to give it to someone else.’ As much as I love to do it, it really helped me open up a fresh audience, I loved to go on there and play with all the other comics... but I couldn’t do it anymore because of that fact alone.”Burping and belching babes: How Ladette to Lady defined an eraOumou Sangaré: ‘I think this pandemic has brought us together’In reference to critics who use her to prove that “Mock the Week doesn’t have a problem with women”, the comedian said: “Nuh-uh.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

In what the prime minister Boris Johnson described as a whack-a-mole strategy, flare-ups in other towns and cities across the country could lead to local lockdowns in an attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus. However, the flare-up in Leicester, the largest city in the east Midlands, appears to be much worse than other cities.  Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the government, Leicester recorded 10 per cent of all positive cases in England in the past week, with an infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 over the seven-day period. This is three times higher than the next worst-affected city in the country. As a result, Mr Hancock said that non-essential shops would be closed in Leicester on Tuesday and schools would be shut from Thursday. The city will also not move ahead with the easing of restrictions which is planned for the rest of England from 4 July, including the reopening of pubs, cinemas and restaurants.  Leicester sent back into lockdown as WHO warns ‘worst is yet to come’Leicester travel ban could be imposed if people try to leave cityInside Politics: Hancock puts Leicester back into lockdownFirst UK local lockdown imposed in LeicesterFirst local lockdown imposed in Leicester The measures will apply to Leicester and the surrounding area including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield. Although the East Midlands city has seen a sharper spike in infections than in other areas, the number of confirmed cases is on the rise in 36 of England\u0027s 151 upper-tier local authorities.Doncaster recorded 32 new cases last week up from 11 the week before, while Derbyshire saw a slight increase from 23 to 25 new infections over the same time period. Responding to the situation in Leicester, the shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who represents Leicester South, called into question the speed of the government\u0027s response.We were alerted to the situation in Leicester 11 days ago and now we\u0027ve got tonight from the Secretary of State the whack-a-mole strategy, Mr Ashworth said.

Labour is demanding Downing Street holds a press conference to further explain the Leicester situation, after the daily briefings were cancelled, unless the government had something really important to say.Professor Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nottingham, said that Leicester was facing a unique situation.“There is clearly a very different picture of Covid-19 in Leicester than other parts of the country, 10 per cent of cases in 0.5 per cent of the population… Each local situation is different and requires a locally targeted approach.“Drawing the boundary was never going to be easy. Including three surrounding areas will have upset some people in why these were included, but not other areas.“Somewhere had to be first for a local increase in cases. It just happens to be Leicester.”Why are there so many outbreaks at meat factories?A council in West Yorkshire has reassured residents there is no spike in cases there after some apparent geographical confusion from Mr Hancock.In broadcast interviews about the lockdown measures being re-imposed in Leicester, Mr Hancock referred to previous actions to combat outbreaks in Weston-super-Mare and in Keighley.But it is believed the secretary of state meant to reference Kirklees – the local authority which covers the Cleckheaton meat processing factory where an outbreak of Covid-19 saw 165 positive cases earlier this month.Bradford Council, which covers Keighley, said in a Tweet on Tuesday morning: Just to calm everyone down a bit ... There\u0027s no new Covid-19 spike in Keighley.MattHancock confused Keighley with a different area on TV and radio this morning. Please keep maintaining social distance \u0026amp washing hands so we don\u0027t need to announce a local outbreak in the future.Additional reporting from PA Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are among the stars who have today urged Londoners to bid on sections of Sir Peter Blake’s pop artwork Our Fans to raise money for Help the Hungry.Last Friday, The Independent announced that the giant mural — draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge during its 2017 renovation — would be cut into 100 sections and auctioned off.The work, which echoes Sir Peter’s famous 1967 artwork for The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, is his largest piece, the size of 38 London buses. Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry. I can’t be more honoured.”The piece was originally commissioned by London Advertising, whose founder Michael Moszynski said: “We’re looking forward to seeing the final figures raised.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Understanding what is going on could have implications for planned school reopening and the safety measures this involves.”Leicester residents express fears for businesses as lockdown extendedMr Hancock’s comments come the day after he announced harsher lockdown restrictions were to come into force in Leicester, with non-essential shops shut today.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government said the city’s seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people – three times higher than the next highest city.Mr Hancock also said that the lockdown had been introduced after “targeted action” at factories and workplaces had failed. When asked about possible causes such as poverty, higher ethnic ersity and higher-density housing, Mr Hancock said they were “familiar” to him.He added: “We are still doing the work to understand exactly why the outbreak has been so bad in Leicester. But lots of the reasons that you mentioned just then are familiar to me and people will find them intuitive.”North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen claimed Leicester was a “perfect storm” of a city with younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown, a large ethnic minority population, multi-generational households and large food processing and garment industries.The Conservative MP told BBC Radio 5 Live that the garment industry should have been in lockdown, but workers had carried on.Yet Leicester’s mayor said he had no evidence that garment factories had been “hotspots” for the virus, and said the government had not shared any data on “which neighbourhoods, which communities, indeed which streets” had been worst hit.Police in dark over how to enforce Leicester lockdown – liveLinda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said nobody should fault with local people for not following guidance, or suggest an area’s ersity was to blame.She said: “Let’s be clear – the restrictions being re-introduced are not the fault of the local population … Instead, we need to ask real questions about the adequacy of the UK government’s response to this whole crisis and whether it has, most immediately, failed the people of Leicester.”Downing Street said there were no plans for Mr Hancock to hold a press conference on Tuesday following a demand from Labour that the minister provide more details on the Leicester lockdown.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said people in the city are “crying out for answers to perfectly legitimate questions” as he led calls for a media briefing.The Independent has approached the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England for more details on the rate of infection among children in Leicester.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, there are a number of outstanding questions about how the government intends to implement these restrictions and get the outbreak back under control.“There is confusion about essential travel and what it means for people who travel to work outside the boundaries. There is also no clarity about what extra resources will be put in place to increase testing capacity and what financial support will be available to businesses.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolThe prime minister thanked the people of Leicester for their forbearance and insisted the government was in constant communication with local leaders.In a major speech on rebuilding the country after the pandemic, Mr Johnson said: As we approach 4 July, I must say that the dangers - as we can see in Leicester - the dangers have not gone away.The virus is out there - still circling like a shark in the water.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut EU employers are anticipating the end of those right, which will make it harder for Britons to do some jobs that involve cross-border travel.“We are seeing people refused interviews for jobs because those jobs require the freedom to travel across the EU,” Kalba Meadows, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in France, told the EU Future Relationship Select Committee.UK policies risk ‘retaliatory deportations’ for Brits living in EUWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?“We’re not even at the end of transition yet and there are already real live instances of people’s lives and livelihoods being affected – and that will only increase. So many jobs rely on free movement because of the single market.”Ms Meadows added: “We have a very large number of people whose livelihood is based on working in different countries – people with small businesses, people who are employed, and an awful lot of them face losing our livelihoods. It’s not just about losing your rights on paper, it’s something that affects real lives.”While the Brexit withdrawal agreement protects some of the rights of British citizens abroad and EU citizens in the UK, there are holes in it, notably with regard to jobs not based in a single member state. The integrated nature of EU economies means that occasional travel to other countries is common, particularly in professional-level occupations.There are also gaps in the extent to which Britons’ qualifications will be mutually recognised in the EU after Brexit.Michael Harris, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in Spain, told MPs: “There’s a stereotype of a Briton who lives in Spain – there are a lot of retired people in Spain who won’t be affected by the need to go and work or provide cross-border services, but around 60 per cent of Britons in Spain are working-age or below. Young Britons in the EU are the people who are going to be most affected by this – to go and study and work.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are no rights in the withdrawal agreement on cross-border working,” she said.Britain and the EU are currently negotiating a future relationship, which both sides have always said will cover immigration issues. But political pressure in the UK has led to the government ruling out a continuation of free movement.Neither side’s draft agreement includes provisions for free movement rights and the UK’s draft immigration bill contains no provisions for such policies.Ms Golding told the committee: “We haven’t had any indication from either side that this is a topic that’s being discussed in any detail in the future negotiations.”British in Europe\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

At the same time, beaches in Fort Lauderdale and Broward County will be closed between Friday 3 July and Sunday 5 July, said mayor Dean Trantalis on Sunday.“The reason why we’re doing this is because we feel that we will not be able to provide the necessary safe environment that everyone is entitled to enjoy when they come to our beaches,” said Mr Trantalis.“Our businesses will remain open -- all the restaurants, all the T-shirt shops, all the retail shops -- everything will be open,” he continued. “But, unfortunately, because we normally anticipate large crowds, perhaps even coming from other counties, that we made this decision to move forward.”Still, crowds lambasted Broward County authorities who made that announcement, with some shouting slogans such as “Freedom” and “This is America”, said CNN.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe letter came as Belgium faced growing calls to reassess its colonial history after a wave of global protests against racial inequality, which was sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US last month. Several statues of King Leopold II, under whose rule as many as 10 million Congolese people are thought to have died, have been vandalised in recent weeks, while a petition calling for the removal of all statues of the former king has received more than 80,000 signatures. A nation’s colonial past is not just history – it resonates todayBoris Johnson said colonialism in Africa should never have endedAlbert Memmi: Writer who explored the alienation of colonisationHow Trump’s brandishing of the Bible plays into colonialismAs part of the country’s reckoning with its past, local authorities in the city of Ghent are set to remove a bust of Leopold on Tuesday.Referring to Leopold’s brutal private rule over Congo from 1885 to 1908, Philippe wrote that “acts of violence and cruelty were committed that still weigh on our collective memory”.“The colonial period that followed also caused suffering and humiliation,” he added.Belgium’s protesters target the bloodstained legacy of King Leopold IIWhen Leopold’s personal ownership ended in 1908, he gave Congo over to the Belgian state, which ruled it until its independence was declared in 1960. The current Belgian king said: ”I want to express my most deepest regrets for these wounds of the past, the pain of which is today revived by discrimination that is all too present in our societies.”He also congratulated Mr Tshisekedi on the 60th anniversary of independence, adding that he could not attend the celebrations because of the pandemic.

which means one metre minimum distance when not possible to otherwise.The plus means that the public must also take other precautionary measures to limit any potential spread.Mr Johnson has also revealed pubs will be allowed to serve drinks outside in a bid to boost the economy.Matt Hancock confirmed The Suns story that bars and restaurants will have to keep a record of everyone who visits before being served under new plans.Ministers have discussed a guest register will be kept by landlords and managers to help track and trace coronavirus outbreaks.The idea has been used in New Zealand where each venue must record visitors and carry out regular head counts.Personal details are kept on file for four weeks there and are used to contact peopleone of the patrons later is hit with coronavirus.Some pubs have been allowed to partially reopen in June using outdoor market-style stalls.Government officials have previously suggested it could take many months for pubs to reopen - sparking fears for the future of many of the UKs , locals.Top scientists have predicted that the hospitality could start to pick up without triggering a second wave.The famous pub chain Wetherspoons shut all their doors on March , but have since revealed their plan to reopen over  pubs across the UK.Wetherspoons has said they are investing £million into this new plan to make sure the new measures keep both their staff and customers safe.Each pub will be temperature checking all their staff before they start their sht, as well as providing them with gloves, masks and protective eyewear for them to wear when working.They have also suggested they will be limiting their menu slightly, as well as replacing all the usual condiments with sachets rather than plastic bottles and create one-way systems in and out of the venues.The Sun was given a first glimpse of the new layout as it was revealed there will be screens, posters and floor markings.There will be separate exits and entrances, and tables will not positioned to abide by social distancing rules.The chain however will not be reopening until the government confirms a date when pubs can open again - which will not be until July at earliest.The plans have also revealed that social distancing measures will be in place for when pubs do eventually open.These measures would require drinkers to order their booze remotely via an app, with the punter then having to collect their drinks from the bar to minimise contact between staff and customers.Pubs must have ventilation systems to stop coronavirus building up, while the two metre rule will stay.British pub operators have asked for social distancing rules to be halved from two metres to one, worried that many will have to close permanently otherwise, the Financial Times reported.The report cited Simon Emeny, chief executive of pub group Fullers, as saying that the rules in the country currently went above and beyond the World Health Organisation guidelines.I think its really important thatare relaxed by the time pubs reopen, Emeny was quoted as saying.The FT also added that Jonathan Neame, the head of pub operator Shepherd Neame, said attempting to keep people two metres away would be profoundly challenging and many pubs would have to remain closed.Those pubs which have outdoor beers gardens, where it has been shown that coronavirus is far less likely, will probably be given the green light first.Some pubs were allowed to reopen with outdoor market-style stalls.Early in May, Professor Robert Dingwall, a top Government adviser, said pub beer gardens should reopen as long as punters can stay apart.He told BBC Radio s Today programme: If it is a sunny weekend afternoon and the pub has a garden and the landlords are prepared to accept responsibility for not overcrowding that garden, I see no particular reason why it should not reopen.Tourism Alliance Director Kurt Janson told the Sun Online that pubs could open up large beer gardens on high streets and farmlands in order to maintain socially-distant drinking.Those already with allocated outdoor seating are due to be given guidance on how they might be able to reopen from June .And plans are being considered to offer blanket permission to businesses wanting to add outdoor seating for customers.It is hoped the outdoor openings will allow venues to get people back to work.Shops may also be able to set up stalls outdoors so they can sell their wares on the streets.As well as missing the Euros this year, that bring in millions for locals, a closure over Christmas could sink a huge number of Britain’s locals.Frank Maguire from Truman’s brewery, which has traded in London since , said: “Things are looking pretty dire.“At this rate it seems unlikely that pubs will be open again before Christmas.“Small independent breweries are part of this country’s DNA, but a lot of them won’t survive unless the government extends the grants it has offered to pubs and hotels.“A lot of pubs and breweries were already struggling. If they take on loads of debt, the system will break.”You can join campaigns like Long Live the Local, who are trying to get the government to freeze beer duty to support pubs when they finally reopen.The team is also working on some new plans to try and mitigate the massive toll our boozers are paying for coronavirus.Budweiser is selling gt cards for pubs here, which they then match as a donation to your pub.Landlords can add their pubs to the scheme too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson has said a deal could even be reached this month with new momentum.He spoke with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month.This latest round of talks will continue all week, with Mr Frost and Mr Barnier expected to meet this Friday.Follow our Brexit live blog below for all the latest updates… Here are some of the reactions to David Frosts new appointment as the UKs most senior civil servant: There are big questions over whether Mr Frost will have finished with his duties as EU negotiator by the time he takes his new security job.Today, Michael Gove has said: #Were confident that well be making progress over the next few weeks in EU negotiations.#Theyre being conducted intensively, specically at the request of the Prime Minister and the president of the European Commission.#Portuguese MEP Pedro Silva Pereira has warned there must be #concrete changes# in the UKs position before Brussels agrees to a deal.He says Britain #depends# on its trade links with the European Union. Speaking to Euronews, Mr Silva Pereira said: #I think a no-deal scenario is there, it exists and it is dangerous for everybody, in particular for the UK economy.#The UK depends very much on exports to the European market. #What both parties should do is engage in the negotiations in a constructive manner and try to find a balanced agreement.#Michael Gove has also spoken out in defence of the appointment of Mr Frost this afternoon.The Cabinet Office minister told the Commons: #We have had previous national security advisers, all of them excellent, not all of them necessarily steeped in the security world.#Some of them were distinguished diplomats in their own right.#David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right and it is entirely appropriate the Prime Minister of the day should choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour.#Downing Street has come in for a great deal of criticism on the decision to appoint Mr Frost as the UKs top civil servant # including from former PM Theresa May, as seen in the post below.And today, Tory frontbencher Lord True says the appointment doesnt represent #the politicisation of the Civil Service#.Mr Frost is a career diplomat #perfectly capable of giving dispassionate and wise advice#, he told peers.He was responding to concerns raised by members of the House of Lords following the appointment of Boris Johnsons chief EU negotiator to the key post of National Security Adviser.There has been criticism that, unlike previous holders of the post, Mr Frost is a political adviser rather than a career civil servant, and lacks security experience.He will replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who is also stepping down as Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service, amid reports of clashes with Mr Johnsons chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.Theresa May has today challenged Boris Johnsons decision to appoint Brexit negotiator David Frost as the new National Security Adviser.The former PM says he lacks the #expertise# required. The Government announced the appointment on Sunday after confirming the incumbent Sir Mark Sedwill will step down in August. Ms May has this afternoon challenged Michael Gove over the decision.#On Saturday, my Right Honourable Friend said, ‘we must be able to promote those with proven expertise,# she said.#Why then is the new National Security Adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security #Image: PAForeign affairs minister Wendy Morston said it is #so important# to promote UK interests by having representation in Brussels after the Brexit transition period has ended.It comes as former Tory minister Sir Christopher Chope expressed disappointment that there was no plan to cut the number of FCO staff working in Brussels post-Brexit.He told the Commons: #Its very disappointing thathasnt got a target for the reduction in the number of bureaucrats in Brussels to take effect on January  next year.#Can I suggest that the target might be to reduce the current numbers of  down to .

of more than  trillion euros.As well as that, theyll have to vote on European Commission proposals for a recovery fund to help revive economies hardest hit by coronavirus, notably Italy and Spain, at a summit on July -.Germany also wants the EU to better protect itself from pandemics, coordinate more on health policy and agree on a mechanism for common border management.Also on the agenda is clarying the future relationship with post-Brexit Britain, especially as London rejects any extension of negotiations on a trade deal beyond .Image: EPAChancellor Angela Merkel says she aims to strengthen a ided EU and help its hard-hit economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic when Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the -member bloc tomorrow.Critics have in the last three months raised questions about the future of the bloc as national borders shut and each state resorted, at least initially, to national policies to tackle Covid-.The deadly bug has killed more than , people in the EU.Merkel, who helped steer the EU through its debt and migrant crises, has stressed the need for solidarity in overcoming the crisis.#During the German EU Presidency we will do everything in our power to master this task together in a forward-looking way and to make Europe strong again,# the government said in a draft of its six-month presidency programme, dated June .At the same time as Boris Johnson was unveiling his plan for the UK, the European Union announced  countries whose citizens can be let into the bloc from July .The list includes Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, Algeria, New Zealand, Thailand and South Korea.However, citizens from the U.S., China and Brazil wont be allowed in.Anyone from the UK will be treated in the same way as EU citizens # at least, thats until the end of the Brexit transition process on December .The Foreign Office still advises against travel.Daily Mail asks about “gloopy public spending” and asks whether PM is “more Gordon Brown than Margaret Thatcher now”.“We understand the debate – you know where my instincts are and what Id like to do, which is to cut taxes wherever I possibly can,# Mr Johnson says.But he says the package set out “is the right one – a massive programme of investment, backing and believing in Britain”.A question over possible tax rises for the wealthy to fund the build, build, build motto – but the PM says we need to wait for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to speak next week.“I remain absolutely determined to ensure the tax burden, so far as we possibly can, is reasonable and we continue to be a dynamic competitive open market economy,” he says.Beth Rigby of Sky News asks about the PMs quote that Brits have their “hearts in their mouths” over the economic reverberations of the virus.“Youre talking about build, build, build, but what about jobs, jobs, job, and jobs now ” she says, asking whether the furlough scheme will be extended.The PM says “certainly the furlough scheme runs on until October and we will do everything we can to get this economy moving”.Questions now.Robert Peston of ITV, quoting the Bank of England, says more than half the workforce are either unemployment or under-employed and calls the economic crisis “unprecedented”.He asks how the Government will keep unemployment below the three million level that “blighted the lives of so many in the s”.Mr Johnson says “of course” the country faces a “real, real crisis” – but that the Government will deal with it energetically.“Im not going to pretend this is going to be without real, real dficulty,” he says.And he admits the financial crisis of  “was not as bad” as the current problems.Theres that tagline – build, build, build.A big quote here: Mr Johnson says: “Lets take the zap and elan of the armed services who build the Nightingale hospitals, the selflessness and love of the health and care workers and the charities, the public spirit and good humour of the entire population, and lets brew them together with the superhuman energy of Captain Tom, bounding around his garden at the age of  and raising millions for charity.“Lets take that combination, that spirit, bottle it, swig it, and I believe will have found –not quite a magic potion – at least the right formula to get us through these dark times.”He admits, however, “there will still be some tough times ahead” – but says he believes the country can “bounce forward”.“I am not a communist – I believe it is also the job of the Government to create the conditions for free market enterprise,” Mr Johnson says.He applauds “innovators, wealth creators, capitalist, financiers” – because “in the end, its their willingness to take risks with their own money that will be crucial for our future success”.He says “this is a government that backs Britain”.“I am conscious that it sounds like a prodigious amount of Government intervention – it sounds like a New Deal – andthat is so, then its how its meant to sound and how its meant to be, because that is what the times demand,” Mr Johnson says.He says the Government will be “putting its arms” around Brits.Onto house building.Mr Johnson addresses “decade after decade in which we have failed to build enough homes”.“This government will shortly bring forward the most radical reforms of our planning systems since the end of the Second World War,# he says.Covid- has “taught us the cost of delay”, he says, and asks: “Why are we so slow at building homes in comparison with other countries ” Mr Johnson says we need to unlock lots of areas of the UK, particularly with better road and rail networks.“We will build and rebuild those vital connections to every part of the UK because now is the moment to strengthen that incredible partnership between England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales,” he said.A study of all future road, rail, air and cross-sea links is being carried out too.Chancellor Rishi Sunak will next week set out the Governments plans to get through the first phase of economic recovery – but Mr Johnson says its time to get “radical”.“We will double down on levelling up,” he says.“We will end the injustice that some people need to sell their homes to finance the cost of their care, while others dont.”The PM acknowledges that people are waiting “asbetween the flash of lightning and the thunderclap, with our hearts in our mouths” for news on the economy.He says of the Governments perceived response to the crisis: “Sometimes it seemed like that recurring bad dream where youre telling your feet to run, and your feet cant move.”And he talks about inequality – the “yawning gaps between the best and the rest”.London is the “capital of the world” but “too many parts of our amazing country have felt left behind, neglected, unloved, as though someone took a strategic decision that their fate didnt matter as much as the metropolis,” he adds.Boris Johnson says the “whole of society came together to make a sacrice on behalf of those who might be particularly vulnerable” during lockdown.“We all knew when we went into lockdown there would be huge economic costs,” he says, but that Brits regardless put on a display of solidarity “not seen since the Second World War”.The PM is due to arrive imminently.Hell be standing behind a podium which features the tagline build build build across it – a picture of that is below.Hes

Local action like this is an important tool in our armoury to deal with outbreaks while we get the country back on its feet.As well as Leicester, other towns in the north of England are reported to be causing concern for health officials, including Barnsley, Rochdale and Oldham.The outbreak has seen dozens of fresh cases admitted to the area’s hospitals and Leicester City Council said there have been  confirmed infections in the city in the past two weeks.If further action is needed in Leicester or around the country – we will take itnecessary,” Mr Hancock told the Commons.Labours shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth backed the local lockdown.“The virus remains deadly, it causes signicant long-term harm and still demands a resolute response, he told MPs.If that means restrictions have to remain in place, whether in Leicester or where, orrestrictions have to be reimposed, whether in Leicester or where, then so be it.”Testers have swooped on Leicester to help track the citys spread - with members of the military ramping up tests in mobile units at Spinney Hill Park and Evington Leisure Centre.Thousands of home testing kits are also being made available.Health chiefs hope to control the flare-up by identying as many cases as possible and tracing their contacts, so they can be told to isolate.Sun Online can reveal the coronavirus outbreak is thought to have first emerged in the east of the city centre.Ethically Sourced Products in Spinney Hills, which makes designer Fred Perry polo shirts, has had five positive cases of Covid- out of a -strong workforce.An ex-worker of Ethically Sourced Products, who quit the company earlier this month, said: I’m not surprised by this outbreak.Managing Director Richard Olley declined to comment when approached by The Sun Online. Locals said they believed the outbreak is centred around the North Evington and Highfields areas, in the north east of the city.Others were reported at a sandwich factory and a Sainsbury’s supermarket — and five schools have closed.Officials are also worried about the city’s food production sites and multi-generational households.There had been speculation throughout yesterday that Leicester would be placed in lockdown after the citys Labour Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby expressed his anger after being told by Whitehall officials.He accused the Government of picking on the city and claimed a situation report was superficial and inaccurate.“If the virus is out of control or is spreading with the restrictions, I can’t see how extending them for a further two weeks would make any dference to that, he said.After Mr Hancocks announcement he sounded a more conciliatory tone saying: These measures are stricter than we anticipated but we understand the need for firm action. I am determined that we will make this work and to minimise the time these additional measures need to be in place in the city.From Saturday, England is opening up pubs, restaurants and hairdressers as part of Boris Johnsons plans to unlock the country but any glimmer of hope for locals in Leicester has been quashed.Businesses affected expressed their anger and disappointment about the decision to extend the lockdown.Hairdresser Sandra May, , owner of DJ’s Groom Room  Sandra May’s Hair Studio, said: “I am absolutely furious and devastated.“I’ve had so many calls from customers wanting to know what’s happening. We’re fully booked and they’ve just dropped us right in it.“We’d taken the precautions with PPE and planned training for the staff, we were even doing our own track and tracing, we’ve sterilised everything - it’s cost a fortune.“I’ve been following the rules but I’m opening on July  regardless. I’ve told all my clients.“If they want to arrest all the hairdressers in Leicester they’ll have some prisoners with great hair.”Alex Hylton, , licensee of the Salmon pub, said: “I’m absolutely gutted about lockdown being extended.“If we have to stay shut to help the city recover, I completely respect that. But I can’t see there will be any support from the local or national government.“This year would’ve been a great year for the pub with the Euros, Leicester in the Champions League and a massive Kasabian gig down the road. We would have sold loads of beer over the summer.”Meanwhile a local politician has said language barriers among the citys large Asian community could be one possible factor behind the recent spike.City councillor Ratilal Govind told MailOnline that he thought there had been a lack of communication with people who do not speak English as a first language in the city.Councillor Govind, who represents the city’s Evington ward where one of the four mobile testing stations for the virus has been sited, said: I have seen young people getting together, having a few drinks and conversation.“They are just social gatherings. With these young people there is a language barrier. They are speaking their own language and I tell them to disperse in Gujarati.“There is a lack of communication made worse by the language barriers.”Speaking of the surge in new cases on a visit to a construction site in West London on Monday morning, the PM said: We are concerned about Leicester, we are concerned about any local outbreak.I want to stress to people that we are not out of the woods yet. We are making these cautious, calibrated steps, we are opening as much of hospitality as we can on July , opening as much of the economy as we can - some things, alas, still remain closed until they can become Covid-secure.The UKs coronavirus death toll has risen to , after  more deaths were confirmed today.Sir Peter Soulsby said he will need to be convinced into keeping pubs and restaurants shut in Leicester - as a fresh spike in coronavirus cases blasts the area.He was left furious this morning after Public Health Englandsent him a report of the situation overnight.According to Sir Peter, the reports recommendations are about extending the restrictions for a further two weeks, but what we still dont have - whether its lockdown or restrictions - is why on earth you would do it and why you would do it here in Leicester.The fuming mayor said the report had been cobbled together and readily acknowledges that cases are higher in Leicester due to higher levels of testing in the city.He told the BBC: Ive looked at this report and, frankly, its obviously been cobbled together very hastily.Its superficial and its description of Leicester is inaccurate and certainly it does not provide us with the information we needwe are to remain restricted for two weeks longer than the rest of the country.He added that the local whack-a-mole strategy had worked in Weston-super-Mare and where there had been outbreaks around GP surgeries in London.Thats the same approach that we will bring to bear in Leicester as well.  The PMs comments come after the Government was warned this week that imposing local lockdowns could lead to signicant disorder.But some MPs, including Labour MP for Leicester East, Claudia Webbe, believe they may be necessary.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Webbe said: I’m very concerned, and I really do believe that where the data allows we need to ensure that we engage in processes to protect lives, and I think we need to go into therefore more localised lockdown to protect lives and ensure that we can address this virus.“The Government hasn’t reassured us. Thus far, the messages and the communication from the Government have been unclear, and it has been dficult, and I really don’t understand what communities are meant to follow.”The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledged the city was an area of concern as it urged residents to be vigilant against the virus.Anyone with symptoms should get a test as soon as possible, they stressed.  Sage documents recently revealed that local lockdowns could see violence and social unrest erupt.In papers released at the end of May, the Security sub-group, which feeds into the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned that imposing local lockdowns would not be suitable for implementation in the UK.Experts from Keele University warned it could undermine the consensus that has been built on the need for restrictive measures and lead to signicant issues of disorder.They added: The measures as proposed would entail the use of state power in an unprecedented way that could be perceived as discriminatory. A consensus has evolved in the UK over the last weeks concerning the need for restrictive measures which suggests that support for restrictive measures is contingent upon a sense of equality of sacrice . The proposed scheme undermines this core proposition.They added: Anger arising from communities who perceived they have been locked down unfairly would be directed at police in the majority of cases.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats not just about PPE - thats about regular testing so you root out asymptomatic carriers of the virus and I think thats something where we could go a lot further.It comes as pubs, restaurants and other hospitality industries are set to reopen in England on July .But non-essential shops in Leicester will be closed from Tuesday after a rise in Covid- cases.In the past week,  per cent of all positive cases were in city - meaning the planned easing of restrictions there will not go ahead.People have also been advised against all but essential travel.Health secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesters seven-day infection rate was  cases per , - three times that of the next highest city.While the exact area impacted is not expected to be made clear until later, Mr Hancock said Leicester and the surrounding conurbation including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield would be included.Leicester City Council said there had been  confirmed cases of coronavirus in the city in the past two weeks, and that an indoor testing centre would open on Tuesday at the Highfields Community Centre, with further testing sites planned.Mr Hancock said the measures would be kept under review and would not stay in place any longer than is necessary, adding: Well reviewwe can release any of the measures in two weeks.He told the Commons: These actions are profoundly in the national interest too because its in everyones interests that we control the virus as locally as possible.Local action like this is an important tool in our armoury to deal with outbreaks while we get the country back on its feet.Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who represents Leicester South, said: We were alerted to the situation in Leicester  days ago and now weve got tonight from the Secretary of State the whack-a-mole strategy.Doesnt he agree thatwere as a nation to ease the lockdown smoothly then those areas that do see flare-ups will need greater speed in the response, otherwise we risk no moles getting whacked In the Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt also expressed concerns that antibody testing - which showssomeone has previously had Covid- - was being used on NHS staff.The chairman of the Commons Health and Social Care Select Committee added: Given that it takes up to three weeks for an antibody to show, how can a regime that is meant to stop the asymptomatic transmission of the virus to patients and colleagues before they manage to transmit it possibly work Responding, Mr Hancock said: That regime is the one recommended by clinicians.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide.

Money for an extension for an expected increase in numbers was squeezed from a property developer, but it looks like that will be ed because the local council, for reasons understood only by itself, has decided the school doesnapost need the work. Itaposs a good school. The teaching is great, and sheaposll love it. I still wish she was going to eat lunch in a room where the walls joined up in the conventional fashion, and everyone could be certain the weather wouldnapost become a condiment. So the announcement, trailed in the Sunday papers and made today by Boris Johnson, of £bn for a national school building project, is of particular interest. Mostly, because it shows that for £, a year Eton taught him no maths whatsoever.All children deserve the best possible start in le, he said. Itaposs important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.Except the £bn is over  years, and for  projects. So thataposs  schools a year, at £m each, even though in  a new primary cost around £m.Between  and , the Tories opened  aposfree schoolsapos, costing £.bn. So that was  schools a year, at an average of £.m each. A much better rate ofthan we are now offered, even though around £m of it went on lawyers.Between  and , the Building Schools for the Future programme rebuilt or refurbished  schools. It was going to invest £bn over  years and rebuild every secondary in the country. Its flaws - a lack of big-project expertise in local councils, PFI fees, and the fact it was a Labour idea - meant the Tories cancelled it. BSF was the biggest school building programme since the Victorian one, which had put a primary school in almost every town and village in the country. Have you spotted the pattern  We have spent an ever-decreasing proportion of our cash on schools, for more than a century.Last year it was revealed weaposll need , new classrooms for a .% increase in primary pupils by . For Johnsonaposs plan to meet that demand, the first  schools he promises next year would need to have , classrooms - each.The National Audit Office says our , primary, middle and secondary state schools need a total of £.bn of repairs - just repairs - but the PM has offered them £m for crumbling buildings. Thataposs % of whataposs needed, or £, per school. With an average primary school refurbishment cost of £, per square metre, that would pay for .sq metres. Or about half a classroom.BSF built schools, slowly, in areas where they were wanted. Free schools has put them, quicker, where they are not needed. A report by the Education Policy Institute last year found far fewer of them being opened in hampered areas. And during lockdown, it is children in those places which have suffered most, had least access to the technology needed to keep up, and now need the most help. To recap, class: the PM has promised £bn over  years for  schools which will be the most expensive, and biggest, ever built. He is also offering % of the repairs we need to existing schools, which still have to find room for .% more pupils in the next  years.He has not mentioned where he is going to get this money from, whether itaposll be raised from taxation, borrowing, or provided by private finance.We do know, however, that it is only % of the £.bn funding by  that he promised in his election manesto just  months ago. His forest of magic money trees seems to have developed a series case of cash dieback.Johnson is threatening to fine parentsthey do not send children into schools where % of repairs will not be carried out, and pupil numbers will grow but classrooms will not. Heaposs cajoling voters with headlines about a schools building programme which would more accurately be described as a £bn cut on just one of the impossible promises he made to voters. Add that all up, and you have a Prime Minister, and a government, that are so antithetical to logic, history, and basic mathematics that they should be kept as far away from the state school system, pupils and parents, as humanly possible. I suggest we send him back to Eton, and throw away the key. Itaposs cheaper than letting him loose, and perhaps its teachers will realise that priding themselves on producing Prime Ministers means that,a pupil is neither great or good, they shouldnapost be allowed to graduate.

From today non-essential shops in Leicester must close all over again and schools will shut their doors from Thursday. As the rest of England prepares to ease restrictions from July , the reopening of pubs and hairdressers in the city has been cancelled because of rising cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesteraposs seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city. A dedicated walk-in centre, extra funding and support, and Covid-secure workplaces have been announced by Downing Street in an effort to fight the virus. Here is a rundown of how the unprecedented local lockdown will work. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  What are the local lockdown measures in Leicester  Non-essential shops which opened on June  must shut from Tuesday onwards in Leicester. That includes clothes shops, toy shops and clothes shops. It means many retail firms in Leicester must not open their doors on Tuesday morning - despite the lockdown coming with just hours to spare, after they closed up for the night. Primary schools which opened to some pupils from June  must once again close in Leicester, to all but the most vulnerable or children of key workers, from this Thursday.  Pubs, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers and more in the city will not reopen as in the rest of England on July . And shielding for vulnerable people will not be eased in Leicester when it is in the rest of England on July . People in Leicester must once again “stay at home as much as you can” and cease non-essential travel. So is the law now dferent in Leicester to the rest of England  Not yet, but it will be soon. The Department of Health and Social Care is expected to publish a law enacting the measures on Tuesday. It is likely to be similar to the laws that enforced lockdown in the rest of England.  It’s not yet confirmedpeople will be hit with fines of £ for breaching the tighter local lockdown. Will there be roadblocks to enforce it  Matt Hancock did not mention roadblocks in his statement and No indicated they were not the priority. However, the Health Secretary also warned: We recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester. If people continue to travel in and out of the city, the government has not explicitly ruled out such checks in future.  Where exactly does it apply  The drastic measures also apply to surrounding areas including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield. Leicestershire County Council public health bosses have been charged with drawing up areas to fall under the local lockdown. A more specic description of which areas are affected is expected to be announced on Tuesday. How long will the local lockdown last  It looks like it will last at least two weeks. The local measures have no fixed end date and will be reviewed for the first time in two weeksapos time. Could there be more local lockdowns     Yes, it’s possible. Boris Johnson promised a “whack-a-mole” approach to local outbreaks and Mr Hancock said there could be “local lockdowns”.But the government has also been accused of responding too slowly to Leicester, where concerns were raised weeks ago. Why Leicester  Matt Hancock revealed % of all positive cases in the country over the past week have been in Leicester. He said the  day infection rate in the city is  cases per k people - three times higher than the next highest city. And there are six to  admissions to hospital a day rather than one a day at other trusts.  Sources have told the Mirror meat processing plants and gatherings around takeaways have come under the spotlight as a possible source of the outbreak. And Labour’s Leicester MP Jon Ashworth pinpointed high poverty and a large BAME population who are at greater risk. What support will the city get  The city - which has already had four mobile testing units sent in - will now receive further testing capability including a walk-in centre. There will also be extra funding for Leicester and Leicestershire councils for public information campaigns, including translations in “appropriate languages”. Support will be made available to those who have to self-isolate and the government will work with specic workplaces that have seen clusters of cases.  Nick Rushton, leader of Leicestershire County Council, said: “Protecting residents is our main concern and we’re working closely with Leicester City Council and the Government to bring down the number of cases.“Clearly coronavirus does not adhere to lines on a map. And although county rates are below the national and regional averages, we can’t be complacent and it makes sense to step up restrictions in areas closer to the city.“This is the first localised lockdown on this scale and undoubtedly there will be issues to iron out.

Michael Gove appeared in the House of Commons to defend the appointment of Boris Johnson apos chief EU negotiator to the key post of national security adviser . But Theresa May slammed the decision saying she had spent nine years on the National Security Council listening to expert, independent advice but that Mr Johnsonaposs move would put someone with no proven experience in the top roleUnlike previous holders of the post, David Frost is a political adviser rather than a career civil servant and lacks security experience.He will replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who is also stepping down as Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service, amid reports of clashes with Mr Johnsonaposs chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.The decision was widely criticised, and today former Tory PM Theresa May, savaged Mr Gove over the decision. Mrs May, who worked closely with Sir Mark, slammed the move - and questioned Mr Frostaposs qualications for the role. The ex-Tory leader opened by paying tribute to the reportedly ousted chief mandarin praising his extraordinary public service. She went on: I served on National Security Council for nine years, six as Home Secretary and three as Prime Minister. During that time I listened to the expert independent advice from National Security Advisors. On Saturday, Mr Right Honourable Friendsaid we must able to promote those with aposproven expertiseapos Why then, is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security  Mr Gove said not all national security advisers have been steeped in the security world but they were all excellent.  He added: David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right, and it is entirely appropriate that the Prime Minister of the day should choose an advisor appropriate to the needs of the hour. Theresa May shook her head as Mr Gove replied to her question. It came as Tory grandees piled pressure on the Prime Minister over the suggestion he and his allies forced Britainaposs top civil servant and national security chief from his post. Former Tory leader and Foreign Secretary William Hague attacked the “politicization of official appointments. Writing in the Daily , he described anonymous briefings designed to undermine senior officials as “a reprehensible habit of the current team in No. ”.  The former cabinet secretary Lord OaposDonnell warned that political appointees were more likely to be yes-men - telling ministers what they wanted to hear rather than speaking truth to power. Iaposm worried about the appointment of David Frost as national security adviser because Iaposm not quite sure how putting a special adviser in that role works, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.

Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the Government was not making non-essential travel illegal, but said it wouldit had to. He added: On shops, the non-essential retail, we will be closing them by law and changing the law in the next day or two to put that into effect.We are also not releasing the legal measures that lt the lockdown for the rest of the country.

Pam Shasteen, , was left devastated by the reaction to husband-to-be Jonathan Langevin who at  is  years her junior. The besotted couple from Tulsa, Oklahoma, US, have ignored scathing comments about their relationship including cruel jibes that Jonathan is young enough to be Pamaposs boyfriend.

Spider webs and thick layers of dust and grime cover surfaces and possessions, a womanaposs dressing gown hangs on the back of a door and childrenaposs toys and teddy bears sit in an upstairs room. A Harrogate-based urban explorer who snapped these pictures said the house is stuck in a time warp - and it has a tragic back story. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror. It is said the property belonged to a -year-old woman who died alone inside the house in .Her possessions were never cleared out after the property was inherited by her son who is believed to live overseas, said the young explorer, who runs a Facebook page called Lost Places  Forgotten Faces. He said the time capsule is filled with old artacts, family photos, wedding albums, calendars and newspapers that were purchased or delivered shortly before the owneraposs death, and others from the s.In the bathroom,  teeth, toothbrushes, razors and a toy boat rest above a sink, clothes are piled in a hamper, and medication and lotions are still in a cabinet. The toilet and bathtub are covered in grime. Black and white photos, postcards and other belongings are scattered on a bed in a bedroom, where the floor is also covered with possessions and there is graffiti on a wall. Another bedroom photo shows an old record player, a poster of singer Kate Bush and piles of decades-old magazines. Tins of food and bottles of condiments still sit on shelves, there are empty bottles of cognac, an old TV rests on a desk and a three wheel rollator that the woman used to get around is in the kitchen. An old rotary phone hangs on a living room wall and eyeglasses lay on a desk with books, letters that arrived in the post and more photos and postcards.A North Yorkshire Police Athletics Association diary from  has been placed on top of a newspaper from March . A souvenir edition of a newspaper insert, dated February , , commemorates the death of Winston Churchill a week after his death. A History of Royal Weddings calendar from  features photos of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, The explore, who asked not to be named, told : The small house has not been lived in since , as indicated by the most recently dated newspapers.A woman lived there alone after her husband died. Documents within the house indicate she died alone in the house in , aged only . The house is a time capsule of old artacts, ornaments, photographs, wedding albums, calendars, newspapers. Her clothes are still hanging up in her wardrobe, her dressing gown is still on the back of the door, and her  teeth remain resting above the decaying sink.  There are childrenaposs toys and teddies upstairs, which tells me that maybe her grandchildren would once come and visit her. There are also a number of empty vintage cognac bottles found throughout, so itaposs fair to say she enjoyed a tipple once in a while. The explorer added: The house had been set up with assisted living handles to help her get around. The stairs leading to the upper floor were worryingly steep, even for me, so I could only imagine the struggle she would have getting up there.  She evidently ended her le by living only downstairs as a bed had been assembled to the rear of the dining room. She died in bed alone next to her walker. Seeing everything left behind, a letime of possessions now rendered meaningless, made me feel so sad. Apparently, her only son lives abroad and after attending her funeral in , he inherited the house but never bothered to clear out her belongings and they have since remained in a time warp.  His inheritance has subsequently become a battered relic of a once family home. The explorer, who is in his s, has been photographing abandoned places since November last year. He visited this home with his partner earlier in June. He said: What hit me straight away, literally, was a blanket of old cobwebs that have collected over years of abandonment. I had to fight my way through them just to get around inside the house.

It could face another two weeks in lockdown in a bid to control an outbreak of  coronavirus, it has been suggested. But it is not the only area experiencing a rise in cases, as a tally shows dozens of areas are still seeing more cases even as the spread of Covid- slows. New confirmed cases have been rising across  of the  upper-tier local authorities in England in recent weeks as the country moves through its lockdown phases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give an update to the Commons this evening after talks with Leicesteraposs leaders. Officials have suggested keeping in place current lockdown restrictions in the city - which are due to be lted across the country on July  - in order to stamp out the local outbreak. The country is bracing for pubs, hotels and places of worship and businesses like hairdressers to finally reopen. Brits will also be able to mix indoors more at each othersapos homes as long as social distancing guidelines are followed. But Leicester Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby claims he has been told the city could have to wait for another fortnight to follow the rest of the country into the easing of the lockdown rules. The city has recorded  new cases of coronavirus in the last two weeks, leading to speculation over the weekend that it would be locked down. Home Secretary Priti Patel has confirmed the Government are considering a lockdown in the area.  Sir Peter said any extension would mean pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, outdoor playgrounds and other areas would not reopen as planned on July . Soldiers from the Royal Logistics Corps have been pictured at a new mobile coronavirus testing site at Evington Leisure Centre in Leicester this morning. Figures show the areas around England where Covid- cases were still rising in recent weeks. Doncaster has seen a spike in new cases - from  in the week to June  to  last week.  Derbyshire saw  new cases in the week to June , up from  the week before. Currently, the method being used by local authorities to control the virus focuses on closing down settings such as businesses and schools where there are flare ups - and contact tracing those affected. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described this as a whack-a-mole strategy. It is currently unclear how a lockdown in a particular town or city would work in practice. The Government and officials from Leicester were due to meet this afternoon to discuss the recommendations.  Other countries which have seen sudden spikes, such as Germany, are currently implementing similar localised lockdowns. Some  people are still testing positive for coronavirus every single day across the UK. The UK has now suffered more than , deaths from the virus, the worst death toll in Europe. The Government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid- across the UK, which are thought to have passed ,.

Doncaster, second behind Leicester, is among the places that have seen a worrying spike. Derbyshire is one of the counties where cases are higher than other regions. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdresses and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. Public health officials are keeping an eye on Doncaster and other areas that have seen a signicant increase in cases in recent weeks as England gradually emerged from its Covid- lockdown with the reopening of schools and easing of other restrictions. In Leicester, there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children in Leicester, the Health Secretary has said.Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected by the outbreak, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus. Lab-confirmed cases in Leicester have been rising week-on-week, from  between June - to  in the week of June -. Mr Hancock said the cityaposs seven-day infection rate was  cases per ,. Leicester City Council said it had seen  confirmed cases of Covid- in the past two weeks. The Health Secretary said that of course the Government was looking at similar places but said the outbreak in Leicester was very signicantly worse than the next worst-hit place. These  areas rank behind Leicester, ranked behind Leicester, which had the highest number of new lab-confirmed cases, according to the latest available data from Public Health England. Many are urban, densely populated and ethnically erse areas. Five are in London and two are in Kent.

He said that even though children are less likely to get ill from the disease, the decision to shut the cityaposs schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.  Mr Hancock added: We have sent in a lot of extra testing into Leicester over the last  days or so and one of the things we have found is that there are under-s who have tested positive and therefore, because children can transmit the disease - even though they are highly unlikely to get ill from the disease - we think the safest thing to do is close the schools. The reason I said what I did last night about Leicester is that it is an unusually high incidence in children in Leicester. Mr Hancock also said that the lockdown had been introduced in Leicester after targeted action at factories and workplaces had failed. He added: We have been monitoring it incredibly closely, we have put in extra testing units, some of the schools in Leicester were closed already. We also went into some of the factories and workplaces where there was an outbreak and we put in place measures. These sort of much more targeted measures have worked in other outbreaks. So weaposve been taking this highly localised approach, but unfortunately that targeted action wasnapost working in Leicester and thataposs why we have taken this much broader measure. When asked about possible causes such as poverty, higher ethnic ersity, language dficulties and higher-density housing, Mr Hancock said they were familiar to him.He added: We are still doing the work to understand exactly why the outbreak has been so bad in Leicester. But lots of the reasons that you mentioned just then are familiar to me and people will find them intuitive. North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen said that Leicester was a perfect storm of a city with younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown restrictions, a large ethnic minority population, multi-generational households and large food processing and garment industries. The Conservative MP told BBC Radio  Live that the garment industry should have been in lockdown, but workers had carried on.Mr Bridgen added: What we have seen in Leicester is a perfect storm really, you have got a city which has generally got younger people living in it. We know younger people have been less likely to comply with lockdown rules. We have got the biggest ethnic minority population of any city, so you have multi-generational households where the young people have probably been out socialising in breach of the lockdown. On top of that there is quite a substantial food processing industry. And on top of that you have got a very large garment industry which should have locked down which my sources are telling me have worked for internet retailers who have been very busy during the lockdown and they have carried on working as well.

The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince William, and the rest of the royal family looked on proudly as Charles and Dianaaposs eldest son married his university sweetheart. The Monarch beamed as Kate walked up the aisle and seemed happy and relaxed throughout the ceremony. After it was finished and the couple were officially husband and we, she turned to her husband to share her thoughts. A lip reader has shared their sweet exchange, and itaposs very telling of the special day. According to an expert, the Queen said: It was excellent, reports CBS News. Phil them replied: Yes  But when they were standing outside the Abbey, the Queen told him one of the things she wasnapost overly keen about. She said: I wanted them to take the smaller carriage. However Camilla jumped in with a more positive thought, adding: It all went very well.  The Queen replied: Very well. The lip reader also looked at footage of Kate and William as they took their carriage ride around London, waving to well-wishers who had waited hours to catch a glimpse of them. Wills said: I hope I remember ... Itaposs mad, itaposs mad! Oh my goodness it ... really loudly herethese people are clapping. Kate then asks: Did they  Later, Wills turns to his we and says: You look happy.  Kate and William tied the knot on April ,. Brits were given an extra day off to mark the unforgettable occasion, and those who didnapost travel to London held street parties and gathered around the TV to watch the historical moment. After the official ceremony the couple were joined by their family and friends for a meal at Buckingham Palace followed by an evening reception - and it sounds like it was a night to remember. According to insiders, a highlight from the night was when the couple took to the dance floor to sing and dance to Greaseaposs Youaposre the One That I Want. They strutted and sang their way through the John Travolta and ­Olivia Newton-John classic to the delight of guests who were clapping and cheering at the beaming newlyweds. One bleary-eyed guest – who left the party at .am – said: “The Grease number brought the house down. “They stood holding hands in the ­middle of the dancefloor grinning, then suddenly the opening bars of the song came booming out. “The reaction was just brilliant. Everyone started clapping to the music.

As non-essential shops were closed this morning many locals were asking how far the border spread, with the cityaposs mayor Sir Peter Soulsby saying only this morning he hadnapost been told by the Government. Rising numbers of cases in the East Midlands city - % of all positive cases in the country over the past week - mean the planned easing of restrictions on Saturday will not take place, with people have been advised against all but essential travel. Health secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesteraposs seven-day infection rate was  cases per , - three times that of the next highest city.A map, that featured the Public Health England logo, was being circulated on social media last night but  Leicestershire County Council  said it was not official. The official map has just been released by the county council, Leicestershire Live reports.The areas included are:In Blaby District:• Braunstone Town • Glenfield• Glen Parva• Leicester Forest East • Thorpe Astley In Charnwood:• Birstall• ThurmastonAll areas of Oadby and Wigston. The county council says it is working on a postcode checker for those who live on borders and are unsure.  The huge spike in cases means non-essential shops have closed, and from Thursday schools willto teaching only children of key workers and vulnerable youngsters. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other businesses due to open this weekend wonapost now be able to. And shielding for vulnerable people will not be eased in Leicester when it is in the rest of England on Monday, July . Mr Hancock said Leicesteraposs seven-day infection rate was  cases per , - three times that of the next highest city.  Leicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton said it made sense to step up restrictions in areas close to the city.He said: Clearly coronavirus does not adhere to lines on a map. And although county rates are below the national and regional averages, we canapost be complacent.Mr Hancock said the measures would be kept under review and would not stay in place any longer than is necessary, adding: Weaposll reviewwe can release any of the measures in two weeks. He told the Commons: These actions are profoundly in the national interest too because itaposs in everyoneaposs interests that we control the virus as locally as possible. Local action like this is an important tool in our armoury to deal with outbreaks while we get the country back on its feet.  Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who represents Leicester South, said: We were alerted to the situation in Leicester  days ago and now weaposve got tonight from the Secretary of State the whack-a-mole strategy. Doesnapost he agree thatweaposre as a nation to ease the lockdown smoothly then those areas that do see flare-ups will need greater speed in the response, otherwise we risk no moles getting whacked  Leicester City Council said there had been  confirmed cases of coronavirus in the city in the past two weeks, and that an indoor testing centre would open on Tuesday at the Highfields Community Centre, with further testing sites planned. Earlier today the cityaposs mayor said it would be quite a challenge to enforce the local lockdown without knowing where it begins and ends. Sir Peter said: These measures are stricter than we anticipated but we understand the need for firm action. I am determined that we will make this work and to minimise the time these additional measures need to be in place in the city.

For the past three months many Brits have had to forgo their favourite pastime of going to the pub because of the coronavirus pandemic. While more than , people have died in the UK from Covid-, the daily death rate is now low enough for the Government to ease lockdown restrictions on restaurants, bars and pubs. However, things will not be going straight back to normal. When their doors open at the weekend people will only be able to meet up with members of one other household. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror As well as deciding who you want to share your first frosty pint of the summer with ahead of time, it may be wise to book in advance. Many pubs are only accepting people who have booked places due to lower than normal capacities. Drinks are required to reserve a seat in stripped down boozers that have removed seats and tables to allow for social distancing. For those lucky enough to find themselves inside, then a set of rules will govern how the night unfolds. While ordering at the bar is not banned, drinking at it is.  Pubs will also have to have new measures in place to make sure people can stand at least a metre apart from each other with added mitigation - which could include perspex screens and masks, gloves or visors for staff. As a result, many pubs are expected to only offer table service or encourage customers to user ordering apps. Pub visitors will also be asked to give their name to the pub landlord at the door. This temporary record will now be kept by pubs for  days so those who visit can be contactedthere is a breakout of localised coronavirus. Inside pubs, one-way systems will be used to ensure people do not cross paths.  It is hoped that single-direction traffic inside will reduce congestion and minimise contact between customers. The Government guidance also outlines that doors should be left open, where appropriate, to reduce touchpoints. Maintaining good ventilation is also important and therefore windows and doors should be kept open as much as possible. In addition, pubs are urged to use a one in one out system with toilets to minimise customer interaction. Live performances are not permitted, including music, drama and comedy. Although this will not be a strict rule, customers are asked not to speak too loudly in a bid to lower the chances of oral tranmission.  The Government guidance reads: “All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. “This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. “This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission.” When sitting inside pubs or restaurants, people will be allowed to gather at a social distance in groups of six, with a maximum of two households involved. This six-person limit will also apply to pub gardens, although friends from more than two households will be permitted to socialise.

She explained that she and her partner, who have been a couple for two and a half years, recently welcomed their first child. But only seven weeks after their baby son was born the new mumaposs boyfriend told her that want to break-up with her for the most shallow reason. He told her he doesnapost love her anymore and that things have changed but then went on to point out that since their son was born she hasnapost made any effort with her appearance, specically that she doesnapost wear make-up or shave anymore. The woman admitted that although she regularly shaves her armpits, she isnapost keen on shaving her bikini line just yet because her c-section scar hasnapost properly healed. She took to Netmums to ask users for reassurance, and to find out whether they thought her partner has a valid point. She said: The way I feel my son doesn’t sleep well as it is he’s up every  hours and sometimes awake from am till am and I’m the one who does every night sht, all the cleaning in the house, bottles everything so whilst my son sleeps through the day I’ve got the cleaning to do and the dog to entertain so I don’t get time to do my makeup or anything . When he gets in from work he makes something to eat, sits down for ten minutes with our son then finds something  to keep him busy pops out somewhere or something. I just don’t have time to do makeup or shave! AndI did have time I’d choose to do something  other than that! It’s just made me feel a bit rubbish about myself. He says I’m not affectionate on top of all of that and says I turn my back to him at nightI’m just a really worried first time parent and I don’t think he understands that for the first couple of months my mind and attention is going to be on OUR son. Surely that’s what makes me a good mum you don’t palm somebody off because of it.

Boris Johnson has eased coronavirus restrictions for non-essential businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cafes as part of phase three of a four-stage reopening plan, and has reduced social distancing measures to one metre plus. But the Volunteer Tavern in Bristol plan to delay their reopening for the most heartwarming reason, reports Bristol Post.Staff discovered a bird nest in their beer garden and because they didnapost want to disturb it, they will not be opening their doors this weekend. Pub owner Peter Gibbs said: Earlier this year a bird made a nest up on the roof of the pub but sadly its eggs were attacked by a magpie a few days later. So we think that same bird was looking for a new place to make its nest. Our garden is usually packed with people but as the pubaposs been closed for the past three months, she must have thought it seemed like a very protected and peaceful area to build a new nest.  A few days after spotting the bird in the garden, the member of staff who discovered her went back to find three blue speckled eggs which look like theyaposre not far from hatching. Peter, , who opened the pub nine years ago, had a team meeting outlining the new measures Boris has put in place, and the wellbeing of the bird named aposMama Mintapos by staff and her babies was considered the most emotive aspect.  Even when we were having our socially distanced meeting in the garden we realised it was pretty much impossible to stand anywhere and not be too close to Mama Mint. We decided thatweaposre so worried about disturbing her when thereaposs only  of us in the garden, how are we going to open the pub up to the public and keep people away from her  One thing weaposre proud of here is that people from all walks of le feel safe in our pub, and we think itaposs amazing that nature has that view as well as humans. It would be so lovely for the eggs to hatch in the garden, and ensuring Mama Mint can do that safely is our main priority.

The virologist, who is based in Wuhan, was out of the city at a conference when she received a call telling her to get back to her lab immediately. Two hospital patients had an unusual type of pneumonia and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention needed Zhengliaposs expertise amid fears this new strain of the virus could be a deadly risk to public health. Her director told her to drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now and she was immediately on a train back to the lab in Wuhan.These were the first known cases of coronavirus and for two months Zhengli barely left her lab, working round the clock to learn all she could about Covid-. Within days she and her team had discovered the  coronavirus  gene sequence but they were then aposmuzzledapos from revealing the truth about her incredible discovery in the fight against Covid-.This fuelled fears of a cover up by the Chinese authorities, who had failed to share information or issue warnings early on. Ulitmately they also failed to contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths.Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the Mail on Sunday reported.The journalist explained: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. She identied it as a novel coronavirus and within three days had completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a process which can take monthsnot years. Amplying the genetic material of the virus using the polymerase chain reaction technique Zhengli and her team found five of the infected patients had the same genetic sequences found in all coronaviruses. But even after her incredible disocvery, there was one horrying fear gnawing away at Zhengli - had the virus somehow been leaked from her lab. In the  years she had been working with bats, Zhengli had found the subtropical areas of China posed the biggest risk for the coronavirus being transmitted from animals to human - not the centre of the country where Wuhan is located. She said: I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China. I remember thinking aposcould they have come from our lab apos Over the next few worrying days it emerged it did not seem to be a leak and the virus had likely had several previous, small, outbreaks before emerging in Wuhan at one of the cityaposs controversial wildle markets. Zhengli wrote on Chinese social media in February: I guarantee with my le that the virus has nothing to do with my lab. Animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls in the markets, which have now been closed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It would also seem there had been just one point where the virus had passed from animals to human and had then spread through human to human contact - until it covered the world. They sell a range of creatures, such as bats, civets, pangolins, badgers and crocodiles, although Zhengli and her team believe the virus came directly from the bats themselves. Almost two months after the first cases of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China permanently banned wildle consumption and trade. It is estimated this will forced million people out of work and cost the Chinese economy about £billion. For Zhengli the disocvery of the coronavirus gene sequence is the culmination of more than  years work, which has made her one of the worldaposs leading scientists in her field. Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. Her work started in the wake of SARS, which first emerged in  and killed thousands. Since  there have been no known cases of the virus. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS. But it did start a global push to learn more about coronaviruses and Zhengli was part of the early teams who travelled to remote locations to study bats in caves. For months, work on the epedition was relentless with the team waking at dusk to work ovrnight when the bats had left the caves to hunt for food. They would collect blood, saliva and fecal swabs before grabbing a few hours sleep only tothe following morning to collect urine. For weeks there was no sign of coronavirus in the DNA that had been collected. Zhengli was heartbroken. She said: Eight months of hard work seemed to have gone down the drain. We thought coronaviruses probably did not like Chinese bats. It was as the team were about tohome that they were thrown a leline by another lab, who gave them a diagnostic kit for testing antibodies produced by people with SARS. Admitting she didnapost have high hopes it would work, Zhengli said she had nothing to lose by testing the samples and the results were incredible and was a turning project for the scheme. Antibodies against SARS were found in three species of horseshoe bats, which meant they were one step closer to finding the genetic code.  After testing a huge number of sites, the team then narrowed their search down to the outskirts of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan and for the next five years they targeted their research on that area. One cave seem to be the SARS source and with the high volume of bats meant there was a risk new strains of a coronavirus could evolve from there. They also found that the virus could spread to those who werenapost directly handling the animals. People living in a nearby village had seen bats flying around. Six people had suffered from symptoms similar to SARS. And as humans increasingly encroach on areas that have previously been the domain of the natural world, Zhengli fears the risk of infections spreading also go up.  This coupled with the movement of wildle and livestock around the world, along with increased long-haul travel, creates conditions perfect for the potential spread of a pandemic Last year Zhengli and her team published a study warning of the potential of a bat-borne pandemic. Little did they know just  months later their doomsday predictions would come true. Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves. Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic.

Science is everywhere, from our homes and gardens to what we eat and how we play, so it should be inclusive and accessible for all.#These kits are guaranteed to bring some fun to local bairns, sparking imaginations and new ideas in the process, even more important with the holidays approaching.#Yes, food and shelter are the basic priorities but mental health and wellbeing are also of paramount importance – bairns are bairns and all have the basic right to play, learn and have fun. We can’t wait to see and hear what they make of their kits and hope they bring lots of joy.”For more information contact Carlene Cura, development and fundraising adviser at Dundee Science Centre, on  .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

All others should face prohibitive parking charges.In addition cars would be restricted in the area around Clepington Primary School to improve safety and encourage the use of bicycles among school children.Colin said a network of public spaces would create an improved civic atmosphere and introduce “external living rooms”.Colin added: #We want to deliver a better quality of le for those living, shopping and working in the adjacent area.#The latest proposals have gained the support of ward councillor Lynne Short, who described them as #exciting#.She said: #I support these not only as a local councillor but as a resident. The proposals will enhance the heart of Stobswell.#Meanwhile, the public still has a chance to have their say on the pocket-park proposals, for a new recreation area would be on Craigie Street, just off Albert Street.The first phase of a three-part consultation on the plans was launched earlier this month, with artists’ impressions also unveiled.To find out more visit the forum’s Facebook page, which has a link to the plans.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I hope everyone supports this crowdfunding campaign so that the Belmont can continue to entertain, educate and inspire generations to come.”Belmont Filmhouse has asked members of the public to donate £, the price of a membership, or whatever people can afford, to the cinema to help it get back on its feet.It will also have to invest extra money into making the building safe when it does reopen, and although it has received support through grants and is making use of the Government’s furlough scheme, it has said it will be dficult to make ends meet in the coming month.So far, more than £, has been raised.The Belmont Filmhouse screens more than  films a year, as well as curating seasons and special programmes themed around film genres or directors.It also hosts a film education programme for local schools, which is attended by more than , pupils each year.Juliet Tweedie, head of development for Belmont Filmhouse, said: “We are so grateful for any donations, however large or small, and thank you for thinking of us.”To donate visit gofundme f belmont-filmhouse.Alternatively, cheques can be sent to Belmont Filmhouse,  Belmont Street, Aberdeen, AB JSFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

We want to make sure that new and ing visitors are still dreaming about Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, eventhey can’t physically explore just yet.“Sketching Scotland is a fun take on sightseeing and a way to learn about some of our best-loved attractions, such as Duff House, in a completely new way. We were also conscious that people are looking for ways to use their time creatively and learn a new skill. We loved the thought that people all over the world could be taking  minutes to relax, draw and think of Scotland, and of course hopefully visit in’ real le’ when that is possible.“As restrictions are eased further, we look forward to helping encourage Scots to rediscover the own country, while at the same time supporting businesses as they prepare for the inevitable operational changes and ensuring that communities feel comfortable and capable of welcoming visitors in a safe way.#Other landmarks and buildings featured in the Sketching Scotland series include the V and A museum in Dundee, the Old Man of Hoy and the Italian Chapel in Orkney, The Kelpies near Falkirk and the Glenfinnan Viaduct.To learn more about Sketching Scotland visit the website here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

positive steps to get football up and running continue","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes hopes Scottish football can continue to take positive steps towards ato competitive action.The Dons ed to full contact training at Cormack Park on Monday after the initial two weeks of pre-season were socially distanced.The SPFL and SFA recently confirmed Scottish Government ministers had formally approved full contact training for Premiership clubs could begin on Monday.It is another major step towards the emergence of Scottish football from the Covid- shutdown.McInnes is working his squad towards the SPFL’s targeted August  restart for the Scottish Premiership and a Europa League entry on August .After months of uncertainty during the outbreak Aberdeen now have a clear route marked out for ato action.McInnes is delighted at the recent progress made but accepts there must also be caution.He said: “In the last four weeks we have come quite a long way bit by bit.“Hopefully we can continue to keep making these small steps.“Four weeks ago everything was still a little up in the air.“Although we are not back to normality yet and not out of the woods we have taken big strides to get to where we are now.“A lot of things are now starting to take shape.“We have Europa League dates, the Premiership fixtures coming out soon and the draw date for the Europa Leagueis settled.“Now we have some dates to look forward to in the calendar.#If we take ourselves back four weeks ago, we would have taken that.“We didn’t think it was going to move as quickly as it has done and there is a lot of encouragement for the season to be started as planned.“However, clearly we still have to be mindful of the climate we are living in at the minute.“We know that things can change quite quickly.”Scottish football was shut down at all levels on March  due to the coronavirus pandemic.When Scottish Minister for Sport Joe Fitzpatrick met the SPL and SFA Joint Response Group on May  the football authorities initially proposed July  for the resumption of contact training.However earlier this month the Scottish Government were askedthat time-frame could be accelerated.After careful consideration the green light was given for the resumption of contact training on Monday supported by appropriate public \u2028health measures including regular Covid- testing.Aberdeen players had previously trained on their own for three months due to lockdown restrictions and social distancing.Eventually they ed to socially distanced training a fortnight ago at the £million Cormack Park training facility.Last week Aberdeen made the first signing of the pre-season by securing Jonny Hayes on a two-year contract.Due to the financial hit of the Covid- crisis the Dons have projected losses of £m.Hayes, who was a free agent having left Celtic, agreed to defer his wages for a year to push through ato Aberdeen.Now that contact training has resumed Hayes and his new Dons team-mates are stepping up training intensity as they work towards that August  Premiership restart.McInnes said: “We have to be mindful of the fact that it will almost be five months from the Hibs gameto the first the first game of the season.“The players have had a longer break than they have ever had.“What we did was use the first two weeks to build them up to get players really ready to what they would normally come back for a pre-season.“Then we would use that last month to get them tuned into game related practices.”Another major development in recent week is the growing hope supporters canto stadiums in limited numbers earlier than initially anticipated.Aberdeen are not expecting to have full crowds back at Pittodrie until January next year.However McInnes is optimistic that further changes to social distancing guidelines could yet allow some fans to attend games when next season kicks off.He said: “It is ongoing and it is ever-changing.#We are planning for not having full crowds back in until January  but that may well change.#A fraction of supporters being allowed in I think is a real possibility but it is all dependent on what is happening in society.“If we go down to a  metre rule that might allow stadiums and clubs to be allowed to cope with a certain amount of supporters in.“I think that would be fantastic.“Although there is pay per view and Sky have allowed clubs’ season tickets holders to watch games, supporters are desperate to get back in and watch their team.“If we can get that moving as well that would be another bonus compared to where we were three or four weeks ago when we thought that just wasn’t going to be possible.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Now we find the bullying problem here is equally as bad.The survey results have particular impact and resonance at this point in time, given the dedication of health and care staff during the coronavirus crisis.This type of behaviour has been anecdotally reported for years, so is not a huge shock, but it is nonetheless disgraceful.Apologies are of little use. Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront. In the stretch between the piers, eight tonnes of waste was collected yesterday on the second collection run of the day.This morning, a further  tons of waste was removed along the full stretch of coastline.There were also a number of incidents reported which involved excessive alcohol and fights.Additional police patrols have now been brought in, security put in place to protect refuse crews and additional parking enforcement implemented to support the management of car parks and ticketing.Signage urging people that the conurbation is full are now in use, including on approach roads.Overnight campers were evicted and further patrols by seafront ranger staff will be put in place.Public health messaging has gone out to ensure people stay hydrated especiallystuck in long traffic queues.Ms Slade added: ldquoThe numbers of people descending down here are like those seen on a bank holiday.\"We are not in a position to welcome visitors in these numbers now or to deal with the full range of problems associated with managing volumes of people like this.\"PLEASE do not come. We are not able to welcome you yet.What have Dorset Police said Assistant Chief Constable Sam de Reya, of Dorset Police, said: ldquoThese are unprecedented times and we are urging people to stay away from the area of Bournemouth Beach and other Dorset beaches.ldquoWe continue to work very closely with BCP Council and other partners to ensure the safety of the public.,params: .pushldquoWe are also deploying additional resources to provide increased patrols in the vicinity to help tackle any issues of anti-social behaviour and other offences being committed.ldquoThe declaration of a major incident allows us to bring agencies together so we can take actions available to us to safeguard the public as much as possible.ldquoWe are also reliant on people taking personal responsibility and strongly advise members of the public to think twice before heading to the area.\"Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and such a signicant volume of people heading to one area places a further strain on emergency services resources.ldquoThis influx of visitors to our area places a signicant increase in demand on our service and we would ask people to please bear with us.ldquoWe would therefore stress again that we are asking people to please stay away from the area."},{"url":null,"title":"lidl-launch-cooling-sun-bed-dogs---less-20","story":"Lidl has launched a new cooling sun bed for dogs.Just as we jump at the chance to soak up the summer rays, many cats and dogs also love relaxing in the warm sun.For both ourselvesand our pets, exposure to the sun helps boost our vitamin D levels and improves our moods.However, while the positives are the same, sadly so are the negatives.

travelling abroad.What are air bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the

Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the

spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be

It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real.ldquoThe risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.ldquoIt can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage.ldquoAs well as these, the user can become confused and panicky which may lead to accidents.The gas is not illegal and can be bought widely online and is used by dentists and medical professionals to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.The officer stressed it was ldquonot something we want our children and young people experimenting with.A spokesperson for Midlothian and East Lothian Drugs and Alcohol Partnershipsaid: ldquoWe would like to remind the public that laughing gas might sound fun, but the risks are not.ldquoNitrous oxide slows down messages between the brain and body.ldquoNegative effects can include dizziness, headaches or

poses signicant health concerns as itrsquos a harmful and potentially lethal substance and itrsquos important that young people and their families are aware of the real and signicant health risks associated with using these canisters.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothianrsquos MP, and Iain Gray, the countyrsquos MSP, backed plans for a multi-agency meeting to tackle the issue.Mr MacAskill said: ldquoOne of the main problems in this case is one of supply.ldquoThe substance can feel quite easy to get hold of, but this is absolutely no indicator that it is safe.ldquoIt is extremely dangerous, especially for those with undiagnosed or asymptomatic illnesses.ldquoYoung people who are abusing it are taking huge risks themselves and for their friends as well.ldquoOne of the problems is that there are legitimate uses for the capsules, especially in the catering industry.ldquoThere needs to be a well-rounded approach to tackling this latest trend, involving education, support from the police and responsible vendors.Mr Gray was similarly keen to see the issue tackled and encouraged anyone with information to contact the police.He said: ldquoThere have been widespread reports of large numbers of these discarded canisters being found in areas across the UK over recent weeks.ldquoThe fact that so many were found in one place here suggests that this is also a problem locally and one that will undoubtedly be of concern to parents.ldquoIrsquom pleased to see that a multiagency response is being pursued to help tackle the issue, and would certainly echo what has been said about parents discussing the potential risks with their children and reporting any relevant information to the police.Ch Insp Mitchell urged parents, writing in his Courier column: ldquoPlease do all you

Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week

they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken

From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability.

For that, blame prime ministerial push-ups. Mr Johnsonrsquos determination to prove to a Sunday paper that he was fit for purpose had led to the bizarre sight of the Prime Minister hitting the deck and giving the reporter hellip well, it was not specied how many push-ups he had done.First sign of a tone being set was BBC Breakfast host Chris Mason telling viewers that Marr was ldquolimbering up for his show.Marr, turning to the photo on the front of the Mail on Sunday, said: ldquoThis is the Prime Minister, adding ldquowe are told, asit was possible a body double was used.Then there was the PMrsquos description of himself as ldquofit as a butcherrsquos dog. That was deemed worth chewing over in the paper review, with Marr asking BBC correspondent Hugh Pym, ldquoas a health specialist what the phrase meant.ldquoWe were just speculating about that earlier, whether it meant the dog was fit because it would run around the butcherrsquos shop looking for scraps, or actually eating a lot of meat which probably isnrsquot exactly the message to get across to remain fit, said Pym.Normal, serious business was resumed when the shows turned to the sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey as Shadow Education Secretary for retweeting an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.: Iain Macwhirter on FMs economic recovery plansThe dismissal, which has sparked criticism on the partyrsquos left, took up almost the whole of Marrrsquos interview with Ed Miliband, Shadow Business Secretary.Mr Miliband said Ms Long-Bailey was a ldquovery decent person and he did not believe she was anti-Semitic, but the party leader was right to have acted as he did. This was not about a ldquopurge of the left, he insisted. ldquoHersquos not about purges, I know the guy, he said of Sir Keir.Marr ended on a lighter note by asking the former Labour leader a ldquoslightly mean question.Miliband was almost Tiggerish in his response. ldquoGosh yes, go on, yoursquove asked me many mean questions over the years.If ever there was a politician who looks liberated from the bonds of leadership it is Mr Miliband. Between how he got the job ndash by taking on his own brother ndash to his struggles with bacon sarnies, the MP for Doncaster North did not have his troubles to seek as HM Leader of the Opposition.ldquoYoursquove seen Keir Starmer now in operation for a few months, said Marr. ldquoIs he going to be a better leader of the Labour Party than you There was not a secondrsquos hesitancy. ldquoDefinitely. I think yoursquove seen that already. Look, I certainly never had his approval ratings.The Minister for the Sunday shows was Priti Patel. With the rapid easing of the lockdown in England, and scenes of disturbances at illegal gatherings, it was her job to figuratively read the riot act. ldquoWe can enjoy ourselves in a very responsible way, said Ms Patel.The usual pre-BBC pop-in to Ridge on Sunday yielded a story when Ms Patel was asked about those Labour MPs who had accused her of using her own experiences of racism to ldquogaslight the ldquovery real racism faced by black people in the UK.Ridge askedsome people had a particular problem with Ms Patel as ldquoa BAME woman who was a Conservative.Ms Patel said: ldquoThey clearly take the position that I donrsquot conform to their preconceived idea or stereotypical view of what an ethnic minority woman should stand for and represent.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

But that doesnrsquot mean there is public support for the type of hard Brexit that Boris Johnson and his Brexiters want. In fact, a recent Kantar poll found % of UK voters now back remaining in the EU. But the UK has left the EU, so \"remain\" is not possible ndash only a rather unlikely re-join option .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"description\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media DtdhjwmQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests DtdhjwmQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Kirsty Hughes: Scotland needs to start working now to cement its Euro credentialsBut, in Scotland, the re-join option is not so unlikely nor absent from debate. Independence in the European Union is the Scottish Governmentrsquos clear, long-standing position. Any independent European state can indeed apply to join the EU ndash and despite plenty of hoops to jump through, there is, for now, plenty of goodwill in EU capitals towards Scotland.Meanwhile, in London, Keir Starmer is playing a cautious game on the EU-UK talks ndash hanging back, unlike the other opposition parties, from calling for a two-year extension of transition. Doubtless, Starmer will be ready to critique any basic free trade deal that emerges. But he is playing a long game, and any clear position on Labourrsquos preferred EU-UK deal is not obviously in the offing.In contrast, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Brexit policies are many and ied ndash from independence in the EU to keeping the whole UK in the EUrsquos customs union and single market, or keeping Scotland alone in the single market, or devolving migration policy to enable something akin to free movement of people.But, with deliberate continuity from Theresa May to Boris Johnson, the UK Government has chosen not to engage in any serious way with the devolved administrations. May and Johnson never tried to mend the Brexit ide across the UKrsquos four nations ndash their focus was solely on their core voters and their own backbenchers.So the Brexit fragmentation of the UK has deepened over the last four years, not least since Brexit day on January . Scotland not only voted Remain, together with Northern Ireland, four years ago, but the European debate here remains substantively dferent too.And itrsquos a debate that is intimately intertwined with the independence debate. A recent poll put support for independence at % ndash others have shown a smaller majority or a : split. One factor behind the increase in support for independence is previously pro-UK, Remain voters switching to Yes. While the Conservatives drive Brexit forward and Labour has accepted it, in Scotland, the SNPrsquos option of re-joining the EU will stay a core part of political debate and dynamics.This fundamental dference in English and Scottish political debates is there too in the more specic aspects of the EU-UK talks. The UK Government continues to reject EU demands for a level-playing field to ensure neither side undercuts the other on environmental and labour standards or state aids. Johnsonrsquos agreement, in last autumnrsquos EU-UK political declaration, to negotiate a level-playing field has been discarded by this most ideological of governments.:Kirsty Hughes: Brexit, lies and the Johnson charadeBut the Scottish Government wants its own partial level-playing field in devolved areas, including replicating EU environmental standards as far as possible. How that will play out in the context of other UK trade deals or in UK-devolved politics is an open question.The EU-UK talks are also blocked over fisheries, over judicial and police co-operation, and on overall governance and dispute settlement. Any hints of progress on the technical side in the talks are soon halted by new political pronouncements from London. And consultation between UK and Scottish governments remains non-existent beyond some granular technical discussions between officials.Yet, despite the UK bluster, a deal is perhaps slightly more likely than a no deal outcome. If London can portray a major compromise on its side, with a small sht by Brussels, as EU capitulation, then late October might see a deal ndash allowing time for the European parliament to raty it.But a deal will be thin and damaging. It will re-establish customs and regulatory barriers to trade it will hit the services sector particularly hard. It will slow growth and reduce investment compared to staying closer to the EU. And a no deal outcome will create more chaos and a harder economic hit ndash albeit with the withdrawal agreement still in place, so EU citizensrsquo settled status and the special deal for Northern Ireland will remain.A UK publicity campaign is due in July ndash pushing iniduals and organisations to prepare for the end of transition. But such preparations cannot realistically be done amidst the economic damage and uncertainty from the Covid- crisis, and without knowingthere will be a deal or what it will look like.The double damage from the Covid crisis and a hard Brexit plus premature end of transition will not go unnoticed in Scotland. The SNP faces its own challenges in the months ahead, as the fall-out from the Salmond saga continues. And currently favourable polls for the Holyrood elections next May could sht in our deeply unpredictable Covid era.But the UK, albeit with a special deal for Northern Ireland, is set for a hard orce from the EU. In Scotland, the debate over having that orce imposed on it will continue. The EU debate may be muted in England in the coming years.

To be clear, I am not a member of any political party.Those better qualied than me will comment on educational standards, but as far as reopening schools is concerned it is far too early to pass judgment. We are still several weeks away in a fast-changing situation which could still go either way fully open, blended learning or local lockdown. I expect that local authorities will continue to develop solutions for each scenario over the coming weeks.Some weeks ago the London School of Economics busted the myth that care home deaths pro rata have been higher in Scotland. Fundamental responsibility for barrier nursing and supplying PPE rested with the care home owners but we should be pleased the Scottish Government helped with supplying PPE and there have been ious other positive interventions by the NHS and Care Inspectorate. The actions that the Health Secretary has taken with the NHS boards responsible for the Queen Elizabeth University and Sick Children hospitals should be welcomed rather than condemned much has still to emerge about the delivery of the respective contracts and adherence to specication. We should also commend the setting up of a central unit that will give guidance on design and procurement as well as oversee construction of hospitals across the country in future.Similarly, while the contract for the provision of rail services has not met targets, the contract is being terminated at the next break point. Surely this, combined with the plan to allow a public sector bid, is a sound action and not a failing Mr Loneskiersquos mention of ldquobranding in Gaelic is nothing to do with the SNP or the current Scottish Government. Each public body in Scotland is required to have a Gaelic Plan under the Gaelic LanguageAct , which was introduced at the time of the Labour Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive.The NHS is not the only service that is potentially unsustainable in Scotland under the current allocation of funding in the UK and we could certainly do better. We need to start to realise that Scotland is a wealthy country and when trade, production, land, sea and air assets are allocated properly, Scotland is better resourced pro rata than rUK. We are the wealthy part of the UK and are capable of funding ourselves adequately, becoming similar to countries like Denmark, Finland and Slovakia, which exist quite happily with populations around the same as ours.These small countries donrsquot need big neighbours to let them play their full part in the world either for example only last week Norway and Ireland gained seats on the UN Security Council.John C Hutchison, Fort William.WELL, there we have it, after the Tory UK Government cry of \"get Brexit done\" the mantra now appears to be \"get Covid done\" and move on. This was confirmed by our cavalier PM that England was ending its \"long national hibernation\", with lockdown rapidly easing.This is against the advice of independent health professionals, at home and around the world, who warn of the \"real risk\" of a second wave of coronavirus. However, for the sake of all the peoples of the UK I fervently hope this will not happen.As a new kind of normality arises, the meaningless intransigence of Westminster should accept that a union, freely entered into by two sovereign nations, commands mutual respect with either member able to withdrawa majority of its people decide. With separate legal systems and with very dferent views on Europe and the world, it is now up to the people of Scotland, alone, to decide their destiny. This democratic right is growing in Scotland as polls to date have risen to more than  per cent for independence and with several strong mandates already in place for indyref, an independent Scotland is inevitable with or without the permission of London.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.FOR some time Scotland plc has been run by the marketing department, putting a kilt on everything including a Nightingale Hospital, culminating in the ridiculous plaid face mask sported by the CEO last week.In the meantime the operations departments of education, healthcare, tourism, social care and industry, have under-performed miserably when measured against the competition, yet curiously underspending every year.In the tough times ahead the shareholders of Scotland plc will demand a change of CEO and finance director and impose severe cuts to the banal marketing spend and replacement of all the department heads with people who know which way is up, because, for the first time in recorded history, you are not better off with the devil you know.John Dunlop, Ayr.I FOUND Sir Tom Hunters articleinspiring.

We have been at this juncture before, with the original Salmond inquiry, the Salmond trial and now the trial of the inquiry. At each point the doom of Nicola Sturgeon Alex Salmond was on the cards, and the destruction of the SNP was happily forecast by all the pundits in the Scottish media. There comes a point when wolf is cried too often.So I wonderMr Gordon and his fellow scribblers are too close to the touchlineto feel the reaction of the crowd. I look back at Damian Green, the effective ldquoDeputy Prime Minister of the entire UK, and the serious accusations which faced him. He is no longer a minister, but still a respected MP and a pundit the media often turn to for informed comment, a situation which could not be replicated in Scotland, where only the starkest black and white exist.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I AM surprised that David Rocheshould apparently sell his soul to the devil in order to gain independence for Scotland. I consider his suggestion that Labour voters should betray their cause and vote SNP in order to bring about a single-party independent state is as illogical as it is ill-timed.I believe thathe displays patience until the next UK General Election he will without any doubt see Sir Keir Starmer lead Labour to a majority by a landslide and go on to drain the swamp of Westminster.Many will agree with me that in a misguided and somewhat naiumlve effort to lead his party by consensus, Jeremy Corbyn effectively managed to design an unelectable Labour Party in the last General Election.Sir Keir now has a breathing space to reconstruct a focused, transparent and dependable UK-wide party.During the same period I anticipate Boris Johnson will continue his downward spiral of an incremental collapse in party confidence with growing public unease, suspicion and mistrust.Bill Brown, Milngavie.Read more: Sturgeon tells shoppers not to squander Covid- progress"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9295401.jpg?type=article-full","title":"letters-asylum-seekers-just-like-us","story":"People from both sides of conflicts flee for their lives.

It is worrying that she and other colleagues should be branded as \"trouble-makers\" by some in the system at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for no other reason that they considered there were factors which seemed to endanger the health, and possibly the le, of the hospital patients. Any professional inquiries seemed to be regarded as hostile. The wellbeing of patients seemed to be well down the list of priorities.As a society we increasingly need the strength of character of people like Dr Peters.

The tourism industry will reopen in full on July .However, the Arran Ferry Action Group says some tourism businesses on the island are deciding whether to ldquohunker down and remain in mothballs until next year.Sam Bourne, a spokesman for the group, said: ldquoI know some businesses have decided not to reopen, hotels, guest houses, and self-catering accommodation providers.

However, because of the two-metre social distancing rule, the vessel will still only run at about  per cent of its usual , capacity.While as many as , passengers are normally ferried between Arran and the mainland per day in July, numbers are currently limited to .Mr Bourne said that eventhe service s to its usual summer frequency after the tourism industry reopens on July , the reduced capacity means it may not be viable for businesses on Arran to reopen.In addition to the limitations on capacity, Mr Bourne said the new timetable exacerbates the situation facing Arran locals because CalMac will no longer reserve spaces for people who need to travel to the mainland for vital medical appointments.He noted that by the time people receive notice of medical appointments, which is often less than one week in advance, the  places for the key morning sailing off the island andcrossing will already have been taken.Mr Bourne said this contrasts with the position for residents on the Western Isles, who he said have been given a commitment that places will always be made available for people travelling for medical appointments.Mr Bourne said: ldquoThere is no guarantee [for people on Arran]. Is there a special deal for the Western Isles  This is critical. The backlog for medical appointments is huge.Meanwhile, the Arran Ferry Action Group has welcomed confirmation from CalMac that it will permit passengers to stay in their vehicles on the crossing between Lochranza on Arran and Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula when it resumes on July , after securing an exemption from the Marine and Coastguard Agency . The route is served by the MV Catriona.Mr Bourne said: ldquoWe are slowly making progress, [but] even the north ferry is  passengers maximum and one sailing a day. It is marginal.The intervention from the group comes after it warned earlier this month that ferry capacity constraints due to coronavirus were making le on the island ldquounsustainable.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said the organisation has worked with CalMac to try and move from the essential leline timetable introduced during lockdown to a ldquoshoulderrsquo timetable by July . ldquoHowever, capacity challenges will remain as a result of physical distancing requirements on vessels that are required to protect public health and to ensure compliance with MCA regulations also, he added.The spokesman said CalMac will retain % capacity for ldquoturn up and go travel after consulting islanders who raised concerns over securing space for ldquofamily visits and other allowable trips."},{"url":null,"title":"leicester-becomes-first-city-go-back-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surges","story":"It comes as the rest of England prepares to ease restrictions on pubs and restaurants from Saturday ndash and on the day Boris Johnson sets out a multi-billion pound plan for Britain to recover from the pandemic.Mr Hancock told MPs that non-essential shops in Leicester will close from Tuesday and schools will shut to most pupils from Thursday.He said the easing of the lockdown planned for the rest of England on Saturday cannot happen in Leicester because of rising cases.He made the announcement in a Commons statement that came at pm, four hours after expected and following a day of talks with Leicester officials.Mr Hancock said Leicesterrsquos seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Leicester to reintroduce stricter lockdown measures due to a spike in Covid- cases\",\"description\": \"Leicester to reintroduce stricter lockdown measures due to a spike in Covid- cases\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media gjRmdw poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests gjRmdw.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :A tale of two leaders: Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson during the pandemicLeicester accounts for around % of all positive cases in the country over the past week, and hospital admissions are between six and  per day rather than around one a day at other trusts, he said.He said: ldquoGiven the growing outbreak in Leicester, we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown set to take place on July  happens in Leicester.The Health Secretary advised people from Leicester to stay at home as much as they can while the local lockdown measures continue.He told MPs: ldquoHaving taken clinical advice on the actions necessary and discussed them with the local team in Leicester and Leicestershire, we have made some dficult but important decisions.ldquoWersquove decided that from tomorrow, non-essential retail will have to close and as children have been particularly impacted by this outbreak, schools will also need to close from Thursday, staying open for vulnerable children and children of critical workers as they did throughout.The risk of catching #coronavirus is much less,yoursquore  metres away from an infected person thanyoursquore  metre away.Until the number of cases in #Leicester comes down, please be extra cautious and continue to keep  metres apart from people you dont live with. pic pOTowTIXJmdash Leicester City CouncilJune , ldquoUnfortunately, the clinical advice is that the relaxation of shielding measures due on July  cannot now take place in Leicester.ldquoWe recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester.ldquoWersquoll monitor closely adhering to social distancing rules and wersquoll take further stepsthat is whatrsquos necessary.He said the measures will apply to Leicester and the surrounding conurbation including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield and promised the exact details would be published ldquoimminently.:Coronavirus: From care homes crisis to surgery and scanning backlog -

Not even in times of extreme emergency or crisis, such as the Second World War, have people been faced with such extensive restrictions as the ones we have all had to live with over the last three months or so.And what has been truly remarkable has been the way in which people have done what has been asked of them.Overwhelmingly, iniduals and communities across the country have done the right thing.They have listened, they have responded and they have stayed the course.When the restrictions were put in place there was, I believe, a high level of scepticism as to how far ndash and for how long ndash people would be prepared to comply with lockdown.That scepticism was justied given the scale of what we were all embarking on.Butthere is one overriding lesson I have learned from lockdown it is that people are prepared to endure a lot, are incredibly resilient and are prepared to go to great s to do their bit for the greater goodthey can see there is a compelling communal purpose.There will be many other lessons to be learned as we emerge further from the crisis. I said at the start that we would make mistakes along the way, and that still holds true ndash but at every point I and the ministers and officials in the Scottish Government have sought to do the right things for the right reasons.That is true of governments around the world, all of whom have handled the pandemic in dferent ways but all of whom have been faced by the same dficult choices we have had to make.As we move further out of lockdown, it is important that we continue to try to strike the right balance between getting back towards normality and at the same time ensuring we continue to guard against a resurgence.Bluntly, this crisis is not over ndash no-one should think that it is, and we all need to guard against complacency, which could be our biggest enemy in the days, weeks and months to come.The virus hasnrsquot gone away, and a look at places around the globe which are now experiencing a second spike shows the dangers of dropping our guard.In those places where the virus is on the rise again, we are looking at perhaps the continuation or resurgence of the first wave. And that is before we factor in the dangers posed by the second wave which many experts are warning of.We may be moving cautiously out of lockdown, but that means it is more important than ever that we stick to the rules in place to protect the progress we have made.We have come a long way, but we must all remain vigilant.Nicola Sturgeon is Scotlandrsquos First Minister and SNP leader.Jackson CarlawThis unprecedented and previously unimaginable situation has had an impact on every person and every business. Not just in Scotland, the UK, or even Europe ndash the entire globe has been affected by it.And of course some have been left worse off than others.At the most desperate end of the scale thousands of Scots have lost their lives, often in the most lonely and heartbreaking of circumstances.Not only have families had to grieve the premature death of a loved one, but that has been compounded by restrictions on visiting them in their final days, and a scaled-down funeral involving just a handful of people.We canrsquot underestimate the impact lockdown has had on mental and physical health too.While some people may have been able to make the most of it ndash perhaps developing new exercise routines and revisiting old hobbies ndash for others quality of le has plummeted.That could take the form of being unable to see close friends, partners and family. For some vulnerable people, being forced out of a daily routine can be disruptive and actually catastrophic as far as mental wellbeing goes.And letrsquos not forget children, whorsquove missed key months of socialising with friends and learning and development opportunities.I think almost everyone understood the need for lockdown, but that doesnrsquot always mitigate the devastating impact of it.And while the UK Governmentrsquos furlough scheme has been a safety net for hundreds of thousands of workers and businesses, it canrsquot last forever, and fears about the future of the economy are widespread and legitimate.But one thing that has been heartening about lockdown is how flexible, imaginative and agile businesses have been in coping with such drastic restrictions.Over time, all kinds of iations have popped up, whether thatrsquos restaurants offering new delivery services, or bars converting their front windows to make a takeaway service for cocktails. It proves that, when the chips are down, business owners and their workforce will find a way to make things work.Now, as we enter the new and more liberal phases of lockdown exit, itrsquos essential the Scottish Government supports these organisations, and shows them the same determination and commitment as the businesses themselves have shown over these last  days.Finally, something we should always remember is that survival through lockdown would simply not have been possible without our nurses, carers, public service and other key workers who showed up every day ndash placing their own health and safety at risk ndash to keep the wheels turning.Jackson Carlaw is leader of the Scottish Conservatives.Richard LeonardToday marks  days since the beginning of lockdown in Scotland. We are living in a very dferent world to the one we left behind  days ago.For some that dferent world is that the old indulgences of consumerism and materialism have been replaced with a new re-acquaintance with quietness and nature, but for too many we have also seen changes for the worse.Poverty and indebtedness have risen, and we are now faced with a massive rise in long-term unemployment, the potential collapse of town centres, night-time economies going bust, entire industries at risk and youth unemployment at levels not witnessed for decades.We have been waging a war, but in so doing we have been fighting for the values of unity not ision, of co-operation not competitiveness.Amongst those workers on the front line in that war we have witnessed self-sacrice and devotion in tackling the virus.We are forever in their debt.Our everyday le has been transformed but communities have pulled together like never before.We must take that spirit of hope and apply it to the post-pandemic world.Our new-found values as a society need to be reflected in the actions of the Government so that we do notto the homelessness of the harsh winter before this lockdown spring, so we strive with renewed vigour to eradicate poverty in all its forms and kickstart our economy with an economic plan.A Jobs Guarantee Scheme, to prevent mass unemployment and to provide well-paid, unionised jobs must be an immediate priority.We must revalue the work of carers, of NHS staff, of supermarket workers too.A re-evaluation of their status in our society is long overdue. And we must establish a National Care Service based on people not profit.We are regularly told that we will emerge stronger from this pandemic.But I say that we must never forget those wonderful friends and relatives who we have lost.It is in their memory that we now have a duty to rekindle a flame of hope among the people and to build a better future.Richard Leonard is leader of Scottish Labour.Willie RennieThis crisis has already changed our communities and the way people look at the world and we have only just begun.Itrsquos proved that wersquore both fragile and resilient. That every nation on earth is tightly connected but the balance of health and wealth is not fair.There isnrsquot a household that this crisis hasnrsquot touched.Whether itrsquos those who have been lost to the virus or patients suffering whilst they wait for a postponed operation.Children who have missed out from not being at school or those who have fallen between the cracks of the financial support schemes or have seen their companies collapse.Or it may be the loneliness and depression that comes from missing friends and family. The legacy is deep and could be long felt. Our task now is picking up the pieces. To recover and build something better ndash a fair, green and kind country.First, we must prioritise people in physical pain and with poor mental health. That means getting the NHS safely back up and running as quickly as possible.Secondly, we must get to work rebuilding the economy. That means investing in the skills and talents of people through education and training and job guarantee schemes to prevent the economic scarring of the young.It means investing in capital construction projects to stimulate the economy. We canrsquot afford to crush any fledging recovery with an ideologically driven expenditure reduction programme.I also want a U- wide universal basic income to ensure that everyone can afford to keep a roof over their head and food on the table, especially in the case of a disastrous second wave. A universal basic income would mean no-one would be left behind.Thirdly, often those who sacriced most are those who are paid the least ndash the frontline workers. For health and care workers this is the moment to review and boost their pay. Medals, tokens, and awareness days must be matched by concrete progress in their settlements.Finally, the climate challenge has remained, and we must seek to rebuild in a sustainable fashion. Less travel, more working from home, investment in sustainable transport projects, building a new energy generation system.I have no doubt that fresh challenges will emerge as we rebuild. Sectors like theatre, tourism and hospitality will require tailored support and we may need the state to step in to provide extra support to some businesses that are essential to our economy.Willie Rennie is leader of Scottish LibDems.Patrick HarvieThis crisis has had very dferent effects on people. As Parliament has adopted remote working and video conferencing, Irsquove been able to limit my travel.With a secure home and income, Irsquove been able to stay safe. But I know that these things represent a position of privilege. For so many people the last  days have been incredibly dficult.There are those who have lost loved ones and been unable even to hold a normal funeral.There have been thousands of others who have lost their job or their home. And while some people are furloughed, others have never been working so hard, keeping everyone  safe.Isolation can also take a huge toll on mental health. With summer recess each year Irsquom usually looking forward to some time at home now Irsquom getting sick of my own company for a change. But dficult as lockdown has been, the need for it has been clear.The UK has one of the worst death rates from the virus in the world, butwe hadnrsquot acted to prevent its spread, things could have been so much worse.Many people whorsquove never had to interact with the UKrsquos welfare safety net have seen first hand how inadequate it is. The impact of precarious incomes and precarious housing have been exposed like never before. We clearly need to build back a better economy, and ideas like universal basic income are gaining new attention.Wersquove also seen how technology can cut unnecessary travel and leave our air cleaner. When even the president of the AA said that our previous travel patterns were ldquoinefficient, expensive and not good for the environment, maybe therersquos hope.Vitally, wersquove seen that governments can respond to an emergency when the political will is there.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how one company has been helped, and what support is available. vw, px\"  When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh.The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. vw, px\"  Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency.In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with £m of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.The £, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. vw, px\"  Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable.“Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.”The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest.“Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.”For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit.“There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said.“But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.”Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings.Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. , jobs in Scotand have been furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May ., claims amounting to £ million through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme up to May .%of those eligible for SEISS made a claim.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SCT was delighted to secure a £, grant from the SSE Sustainable Development Fund last month, and hopes to soon confirm the final funding package.SCT bought the site, near Bun-Sgoil Stafainn, from the Stenscholl Township and Kilmuir Estatefor £,, using a grant from the Scottish Land Fund.It followed the conclusion of the Resumption process, removing the development site from crofting tenure, which was approved by the Scottish Land Court earlier this year.SCT director Calum MacDonald said: “The progress made is a great achievement for the community. I know that the community recognises that affordable housing is long overdue.#Welcoming families in need of such accommodation, and who are very keen to live in Staffin, will be a great boost to our village.”HSCHT chief executive Ronnie MacRae said: “The health, economic and social benefits of this scheme will undoubtedly give Staffin strong foundations to build on.”Lachie MacDonald, LSHA chief executive association, added: “We are delighted that this rural mixed-use development is about to start on site. Staffin Community Trust is to be applauded for their vision and determination to drive forward this project.

They had absolutely no idea.What we can surmise is that to anyone where in the UK this looks like a great, safe, destination.It doesn’t really matter because one infected person, , could result in  being infected  days later, and, unchecked, every three days after that the number of infections doubles.If you were on a family holiday and you had very mild symptoms, would you report them, or think you had a summer cold Let us be absolutely clear that the only reason this “R” number is where it is, is because we have all been kept in our homes to stop the virus spreading.The virus is still out there.The stated defence, in fact the only defence, , against that happening is Test, Track and Trace.How do you Test, Track and Trace an itinerant population of “let’s say”  to  tourists who move their location pretty much every day I think inviting an unrestricted number of visitors to the fragile Highland communities is a huge risk.Don’t think I don’t understand the economic consequences. My we and I run a very well-regarded BB taking people from all over the world.This year we will have none.Most BBs are not going to go bust, the owners are living in their own homes.Not so with hotels. So, we need a dferent answer anyway, because the chances are the hotels are not going to make up the number of bed-nights they need to survive in the next three or four months.Both the businesses and their staff need protection.Liquidators and Receivers should be instructed, by Government, to close the business downto stop the ebb of money, and either protect them from creditors, or much better pay the creditors with Government sponsored bank loans, keeping a close record of that expenditure. Perhaps they could also pay the staff They should mothball the business waiting for the day a vaccine or a cure is found, and it can re-open safely, and be handed back to the previous owners. The owners would then be given favourable, very long-term loans to pay back the costs met by the liquidators and receivers.There will be a cost, but a cost the owners can later meet, over many years, at low or virtually zero interest rates. The Government should not foot that bill, but it could facilitate it.I do not for one micro second forget the massive and fantastic contributions to health and care workers, and those on the front line who delivered to our doors at this time.However, my respect and admiration goes to the owners and staff of tourist and hospitality businesses.The financial and mental strains needing to remain optimistic, to remain as responsible employers and to face the financial crisis that this pandemic has brought, needs some recognition.I am sure the cost to trade and business may never truly be known, but must exceed millions of pounds.To those who kept us all safe, by cancelling visitors and closing shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions at this testing time, simple words of thanks are not in any compensation for the vast loss in revenue from the sector.But I would just like to thank all those ethical and responsible businesses that did the right thing, and helping to decrease the possibility of the spread of this virus.The sacrices of owners and staff will not be forgotten, and I would urge all local people to rally round and support these businesses when it is safe to do so.Tourism and hospitality is the mainstay and leblood of our local economy, and with everyone#s help, in time it will recover.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bbc-salisbury.jpg","title":"timely salisbury series showed ordinary people doing the best in an unprecedented","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMy kids seemed to have survived this oversight in their upbringing although in high school it apparently caused some surprise among their pals.I should add it is not all books by candlelight. We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hope-and-faith-scaled.jpg","title":"skye youngsters clock up more than 10000 miles for zambian school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Portree High students were challenged to clock up the miles and between them run or walk the distance between Skye and Lusaka, Zambia – home of the Hope and Faith Community School.Over the last two months pupils and teachers have completed , miles, easily surpassing their original ,-mile target.Now the youngsters have been challenged to add a further , miles before the term ends, and to add to the £ that has been brought in for the project.A donation of £ will pay for school meals for all pupils at the school, which has long established links to Skye.The school began in  with two pupils, but has since grown to help provide education – and a daily meal – for over  children on the outskirts of the Zambian capital..There have been exchange visits between the schools, and Portree teachers Neil Burrows and Tony Breen had been due to head to Africa at Easter, with two Zambian teachers ing to Skye in May.It is now hoped the exchange can go ahead in .Mr Breen, Portree’s deputy head, said the challenge had been a positive one – both for the charity and for the health and well-being of the pupils during lockdown.He added: “We are very pleased with the balance of work and wellbeing for the majority of our pupils.“Looking at our provision of online learning in comparison with the rest of Scotland, most parents have been happy with the dferent ways in which pupils have been learning # from watching teachers pre-made videos, google meets and chats, online quizzes, and even DIY science practicals.”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Skye-golf-club-sconser.jpg","title":"green for go competitions off and running again at the isle of skye golf","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSomewhat belatedly the competitions have commenced and it was to the ladies section that the honour of opening the season belonged.On a recent blustery Sunday a quartet of quines graced the fairways at Sconser and Sandi Beatson emerged from the pack to steal the headlines on day one.Playing off her #mark# of  two steady halves of  and  saw her record an opening day handicap-reducing gross score of  and an immediate #cut# from  to  so very well played and what a great start to her golfing season.Proxime accessit was Donalda Johnston with a gross score of  in this the first of five rounds to be played for the Ladies Championship.Incidentally in this same competition last year Sandi also recorded a victorious, handicap-reducing score of three under the Competitions Scratch Score* for the day.

It#s amazing how popular it was. With the Game of Thrones connection nearby, we#ve had people make a detour to go by the church and get a photograph.The tree was a runner-up in the Woodland Trust Tree of the Year awards in .They did look at the history at the time and said it was entirely plausible that the legend could in fact be true.Everyone in the parish has always been very fond of it and we#ve already been inundated with offers from people to make sure the tree lives on in some form. We will certainly be trying to do something like that, but the first priority is to make the area safe.It was in late May  when a fleet of  ships set sail from Spain to invade England, King Phillip II#s aim to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and halt the rise of Protestantism.The story goes that gales had blown his ship hundreds of miles off course before it was wrecked off the coast of Northern Ireland. The sailor#s body washed up on the shores of Ballygally Bay in , where locals discovered the corpse and buried it in an unmarked grave at St Patrick#s Church.But his grave didn#t remain unmarked for long. A sapling sprouted and went on to stand there for over  years.It#s quite a tale and one which the locals around here love to tell, said Rev Benson.We#d be hopeful of finding out more about the history of it now it#s fallen.We could see on CCTV that the tree fell about half five in the morning. It was very calm so there was no storm damage as such.It#s now resting across some gravestones so we need to be careful about moving it.We had a tree surgeon come up and look at it and apparently the roots had gone. Unfortunately that#s it. It would have happened sooner or later and we#re thankful it happened when it did, with no-one around. It was just the weight of the tree that finally brought it over.But there#s no way we want to turn it into firewood, we#re much too fond of it for that.Once we examine the condition of the wood we#ll be looking into doing something with it. The trunk itself is quite a size and we want to use it to create something substantial for local people to remember it by. It deserves to be preserved.Rev Benson is now hopeful that a study of the site might bring some answers as to whether there#s any truth in the legend.There#s interest from an archaeologist who will be coming down to have a look and seethere#s anything underneath where the tree stood, said Rev Benson.Now that the tree is down we can let experts take a really good look at it, date it properly and seeindeed it did grow from the chestnuts in the pocket of a Spanish Armada sailor who may still lie beneath it.In the meantime, Rev Benson has urged people not to come along to the graveyard to salvage a piece of history. The graveyard is covered by CCTV and numerous people have already ignored the tape around the fallen tree to take wood and cuttings.We cannot stress enough that the tree is not safe, he added.We don#t want to close the graveyard, butpeople continue to ignore the warnings, that is unfortunately the action we will have to take. Anyone ignoring the tape is personally liable for any further damage to yourself or the gravestones, so please be careful.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Groups of up to  people allowed to meet outdoors, Foster announcesPictured: The man due in court over sick video about Noah DonohoeLoyalist band parade to go ahead despite warning it will breach lockdownBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUP#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I realised it had to be his.Ms Crooks, who attended the north Belfast vigils for Noah on Sunday, immediately called the police at pm. A neighbour#s CCTV would later show Noah walking around the back of the Northwood Road, where there is access to a storm drain, which may or may not have been locked.They realised this must have been where Noah was last seen alive, she said.I#d obviously started a chain of events because then they were then able to find his clothes and helmet.Then the search and rescue teams appeared. They were here most of the night searching the area around my house, trying to work out where he went next.As a child who grew up here, I was asking myself #where would I have gone  What would I have done#  I just couldn#t work it out.She also revealed that she became very emotional when police officers called to collect Noah#s bicycle.When they took the bike away on Tuesday afternoon, I burst into tears, she said.I#ve had to take comfort from the fact that me coming across that bike brought the rescue team here to start the search. If I hadn#t brought them here, to this storm drain and this river, maybe they would never have found him.Ms Crooks, a classroom assistant, said she didn#t need to watch any of the news reports because she watched the search unfold in my front garden, my street and in my community.She also told how she met Noah#s aunt Niamh in her back garden and she said they would always be welcome at her home, should they wish to visit.Niamh and others came down to help in the search at one point and had made their own sandwiches, she said. Pastor Brian Madden, who was comforting the family, said #put those sandwiches away, we have got hot food for you, and tea and coffee#. As Brian later said, they didn#t want to encroach on anyone#s generosity.Ms Crooks said that, as a mother of two young boys, she could only imagine how Noah#s mother must be feeling at the loss of her son.You just believe your children are always going to be there with you, she said.Unfortunately that#s now not the case for Fiona. How she#s going to get over this, I just don#t know. I#m heartbroken for her and her family.It is still not known why Noah entered the drain, but police have said they do not believe there was any foul play.The funeral will take place at St Patrick#s Church in north Belfast at am on Wednesday.On Monday the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Frank McCoubrey, opened an online book of condolence in memory of Noah.He said: People from across the city have been deeply affected by the loss of young Noah, and their thoughts and prayers are with Noah#s mother and wider family circle at this devastating time.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandPrivate funeral to be held for schoolboy Noah Donohoe A private funeral will be held for tragic schoolboy Noah Donohoe on Wednesday, his family has announced.

He couldn#t have done it without the support from Mencap. The staff at Mencap have been brilliant to us and are always there for support. We have got to meet so many other families who were in a similar situation and could relate to what we were going through, which really helped. The workshops and training courses were a great help to me and my family.She said the latest milestone came after weeks of practice by her son.His feet never left the ground, but he was so determined to do it. Then suddenly his feet lted, and he was so excited, she said. He loves jumping now. We decided we would like to help raise as much as we can for Mencap so they can go on supporting other families like ours, and to also say thank you to Mencap for everything that they have done for us so far.The Covid- pandemic has meant the Children#s Centre has had to pause face to face support for families and provide as many services as possible online.Margaret Kelly, director of Mencap Northern Ireland, said: I just want to say a huge thank you to Lucius and Joanne for fundraising for Mencap. It means so, so much to us that our families so value our services that they are willing to fundraise on top of everything  they do.She added: Our extraordinary teams are working extremely hard in challenging circumstances to help many children and adults with a learning disability and their families in need of support during this dficult time. Lucius#s jumping is a very special #Move it for Mencap# challenge. It is really wonderful that Lucius and Joanne are helping us to transform the lives of other children with a learning disability and their families to help them build independent and fulfilling lives.Approximately , people in Northern Ireland have a learning disability, with Mencap also providing support to their families and carers with a helpline, online support services and lobbying.For further information on how to donate or take part in the fundraising campaign, visit northernirelaned.mencap.org.ukBelfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Groups of up to  people allowed to meet outdoors, Foster announcesPictured: The man due in court over sick video about Noah Donohoe#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#Loyalist band parade to go ahead despite warning it will breach lockdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast . The Saintfield Road cameras had signicant downtime throughout .The number of detections at mobile camera sitesincreased by % between  and .This followed an increase in deployments of safety camera vans, resulting in more detections.The , other cases were detected by #average speed# cameras.Inspector Leech said everyone had a responsibility to make our roads safer.She added: Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

It#s crippling for a business when they#ve not been making money but for the safety of my staff and also the customers that come in here, it was a no-brainer, we had to take that hit and just put that in.Realistically you can#t run your business and make sure everyone is protected and make sure your staff are protected without stuff like this so it was really dficult, but it has to be done.She said customers would notice many changes, including an appointment-only system.We also can#t give them a hug now, she added.Mrs Grufferty#s sister-in-law Kathleen was one of the first back into one of the salon#s chairs yesterday morning.I#m very excited to be back and feel normal again, she said.I was in at am this morning, it was great - one of the first.Bryant Jordan was also there early.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Public services will be held in many local churches today for the first time in months. There will be many restrictions in place to protect worshippers from possible coronavirus infection. Catholic Bishop of Derry, Doanl McKeown, welcomed the resumption of services but urged people to take care. “I hope that we have learned lessons about le since we were locked down in March,” he said. “This is a time to cherish those lessons and not to allow the insights to be lost in a tsunami of going back to the future. googletag.cmd.push “We have seen what has happened in those places where there has been a stampede to forget we escaped from worse consequences through self-discipline. “It will take many people time to overcome the fear of mixing again. “We want our churches to be places where people can share the infectious good news of the Gospel – but avoid being Corona-infected through selfishness and carelessness. “We have to begin cautiously. “In all areas of human le, short term gain can lead to long-term pain.” The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Andrew Forster, has also appealed to parishioners to be patient and understanding as their churches get ready for the resumption of public worship. googletag.cmd.push “Although in Ireland, at the moment, the virus seems very much under control – which we’re so thankful for – we know the virus is still there,” Bishop Andrew said. “We’ve been given the freedom to meet again [from Monday], but we know that with freedom comes responsibility. “At the moment, going back to church places a lot of responsibility on you and on me, on select vestries and on clergy, and on all those who will attend churches because we’ve got to follow all the public health guidelines and we’ve got to follow the guidelines that the Church of Ireland has put together for that. “I really welcome the opportunity to be back at church but I want you to know that there’s no set date by which this may happen, because select vestries – and clergy in particular – have to make sure that in their parishes it’s right and it’s appropriate and it’s safe to open, and that’ll take time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park.

For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

We know that they will come as soon as the doors are opened. Whether they should is an entirely dferent question. So we need to make sure we are doing things as safely as we can for the folks that are going to come.”During lockdown the church harnessed modern technologies to hold Bible study groups, prayer meetings and record an online Sunday service.Rev McConnell said: “I would say a fair percentage of those things will continue even after lockdown really eases. We’ve found it has opened up new channels of communications for us, people have tuned in who haven’t been to church for years.”Presbyterian churches are also putting safety first with the majority targeting a resumption of worship from mid-July to early August.Cregagh Presbyterian Church was among the first to announce it would be holding a service on Sunday, July .Rev Trevor Gribben, general secretary of the PCI said: “We look forward to being able to meet again, with our brothers and sisters in Christ, while ensuring that the required health and safety principles are met.” He said any decision when to resume services would be a local decision taken by the minister and elders together.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The question that must be asked of the FPCis did you do so on the basis of an express Biblical warrant  Was the decision to cease public worship based on a command, principle or precedent in Scripture  If not then this cessation was not justied.Some may argue that the cessation of public worship was on the basis of health advice and government regulations, that closure was in the interests of public safety.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...To argue so is firstly, to place more importance on public safety than public worship. It reveals how little value is placed on public worship secondly, it demonstrates a lack of faith in God. Is He not in control of every situation The fearful, panicked response of many professing Christians — closing churches, depending on hand sanitisers and face masks — exposes their supposed faith in God as shallow and open to the ridicule of unbelievers. This reaction arises from shallow and unbiblical theology. The Biblical doctrine of the absolute sovereignty of God, that He has ordained whatsoever comes to pass and orders all things for His own glory has been rejected by the modern church in favour of the unbiblical Arminian dispensational teaching of the free will of man and his own natural ability. One of the core pillars of this teaching is the rejection of the absolute sovereignty of God in all things. It teaches man to rely upon himself and his ability, hence in the present situation professing Christians look to face masks etc rather than the God Who is in complete control of their lives and the affairs of the whole world thirdly, to acknowledge the ability or authority of the state to direct or govern the affairs of the church is to deny the Kingship of Christ over the church.What a low and miserable state must the church presently be in to be reduced to meekly waiting on the permission of an executive, including a party that is so close to the IRA, in order to resume public worship.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"
