A study carried out by Essity in the past year found that incontinence was seen as even more difficult to discuss than depression. Many doctors speak of male patients using their wives’ sanitary pads so they don’t end up with a soggy pair of boxers, or staying indoors due to “bladder leash” – the fear of not being able to locate a loo when leaving the house. When is male incontinence most likely to strike?There are different types of incontinence, with men most likely to experience “urge incontinence”. If you’ve ever felt a strong, unexplained impulse to pee, but find you’ve only got a few seconds to sprint to the bathroom, it’s probably urge incontinence. That’s why some men suffer “latchkey incontinence”, the sensation that the floodgates are about to open the moment you twist the key in your front door. Our internal plumbing is usually to blame for leakage, particularly overactive detrusor muscles. When these muscles contract too often (perhaps because you’ve had too much alcohol, too few fluids or even because you’re constipated), it can result in an uncontrollable urge to urinate at unforeseen moments, such as when you hear running water. Other factors that may make it harder to avoid dampness down under include being overweight or having had surgery for prostate cancer, which can result in weakened muscles. Men are also likely to experience post-micturition dribble, which causes a map-like stain to form on underpants after urinating. It’s often down to weakened pelvic floor muscles. What other types of incontinence are there?Men can also experience stress incontinence. That’s not “stress” as in feeling overwhelmed by a bulging inbox, but “stress” as in pressure. It happens when the bladder is put under sudden strain, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting weights in the gym, all of which can cause urine to leak, possibly because the pelvic floor muscles are weak. Incontinence can also be caused by overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention). This is when the bladder doesn’t entirely empty, resulting in a man passing small trickles of urine regularly, along with a feeling that the bladder is constantly full. How can I manage my incontinence so I can lead a normal life again?For starters, go and get a checkup with your GP to help you find out the cause. A trip to your GP may result in you being prescribed a course of antibiotics, or given advice on how lifestyle choices (see below) could alleviate symptoms. Until that’s addressed, and any changes kick in, many men have found the easiest way to manage their urine leakage is by using incontinence products, which allow them to enjoy the social activities they did before. Unsure where to start? Try TENA’s free Keep Control sample pack, which arrives discreetly packaged and allows you to road-test the incontinence tech that works best for you. This could be absorbent protective pads or underpants that look just like normal boxer shorts but keep nether regions dry. What else can I do to prevent bladder attacks?Not gulping down endless cups of tea and coffee during your working day can help, as caffeine is a diuretic that can increase the amount of urine you make. That said, it’s important to drink enough fluids so try to sip plenty of water throughout the day. Eating a healthy diet and keeping to a good weight is also beneficial, as being overweight puts pressure on the bladder. And don’t forget the pelvic floor, the muscles that hold the bladder and rectum in place. Men have less active pelvic floors than women so any exercises that strengthen them, such as pilates, are great.

The total number of people in hospital also dropped by a further 179 to 16,596 as the vaccination campaign sped up, Reuters reports. The health ministry also reported 126 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals, after three days with a hospital coronavirus death toll below 100. The media reports by broadcaster TV2 and newspaper Ekstra Bladet also said Denmark’s vaccination programme would be concluded in September, two weeks after the current timeline. The delay is due to delivery of fewer Moderna vaccines than expected, they reported. Denmark was the first country to exclude the J\u0026ampJ vaccine over a potential link to a rare but serious form of blood clot. A spokeswoman for the health ministry could not immediately comment on the reports. Denmark has also stopped using the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine altogether, citing similar concerns.The Bangkok politan Administration (BMA) late on Monday said the national coronavirus taskforce had overruled the city’s move to allow massage shops, clinics and parks to reopen from Tuesday. It did not provide a reason. Bangkok and the provinces around it are the epicentre of the two-month-old outbreak, during which the vast majority of Thailand’s coronavirus cases and deaths have been recorded. Massage shops, clinics and public parks must remain closed along with schools, cinemas, gyms and zoos for at least 14 more days. The decision comes as the government faces growing public criticism for a slow and chaotic vaccine rollout, which is due to start on 7 June. Thailand reported 5,485 new cases on Monday, with 1,356 of those in Bangkok. The country also reported 19 new deaths on Monday, bringing its total to 1,031 since the outbreak started.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, also told a closing session of its annual week-long ministerial assembly that the UN agency required sustainable and flexible funding. NHS England said 32,938,496 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 99,213 on the previous day, while 21,719,461 were a second dose, an increase of 179,424, PA Media reports.Szijjártó made the announcement after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and added that the agreement would mean a “great strategic advantage” for Hungary, Reuters reports.The pre-action letter sent by advocacy group, the Citizens, working with AWO, a data rights firm, follows a report in the Observer that Public Health England (PHE) was preparing to publish the data on 13 May but the prime minister’s office intervened and put pressure on it not to do so. The legal letter says the public health body is bound by law to be independent from political interference and warns it faces a judicial review unless it releases the data. It cites PHE’s framework agreement with the Department of Health and Social Care that states it has “operational autonomy” and “shall be free to publish and speak on those issues which relate to the nation’s health and wellbeing in order to set out the professional, scientific and objective judgement of the evidence base”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Boris Johnson are both named as “interested parties” in the proposed claim, to which PHE has seven days to respond.  Clara Maguire, the executive director of the Citizens, said: ‘It defies belief that Public Health England is refusing to publish this vital public health data on the spread of the so-called Indian variant in schools despite scientists, teachers, parents and unions all saying that they need it to safeguard theirs and their children’s health. “We believe that there is an immediate risk to life. The public needs this data now and we believe that PHE is acting unlawfully in withholding it. It is unbelievable that a matter of vital importance to our public health can be subject to political interference.” The letter states that PHE had promised stakeholders that the data would be included in reports “on or around 12 May” and that PHE by not then publishing was in “breach of a legitimate expectation”. On Thursday, eight unions wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking for the release of the same data.People who have recovered from a Covid-19 infection should be exempt from restrictions for 180 days, Reuters reports. The commission also proposed that more reliable, but more expensive PCR tests should be valid for 72 hours and rapid antigen tests for 48 hours. Children, who are not yet in line for vaccinations, should not have to undergo a quarantine if travelling with parents who are exempt. Those aged six and older can be subject to tests. The proposals, which are being put to EU member states, mirror those already agreed for travel to the EU from outside the bloc. Ministers have been investigating making coronavirus status certificates compulsory in some settings for months, following the lead of Israel, which introduced a “green pass” for people to demonstrate their low-risk of having or transmitting the disease. As the UK’s vaccination programme continues at greater speed than most countries, questions in Whitehall have focused on how best fully to reopen sectors such as theatres and nightclubs, and restart spectator events including festivals and concerts, without social distancing. But the  has been told that status documents, which would display proof of vaccination, a recent negative test result, or antibodies, are unlikely to be introduced ahead of 21 June – the final stage of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown when all legal limits on social contact are due to be scrapped.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

It will be a little cooler and breezier along the south coast, while western coastal counties should expect some clouds and possible drizzle in the late afternoon.“The very warm weather is continuing on Monday and continuing over the eastern half of the country on Tuesday,” Mr Murphy said, adding that there will be a more unsettled period after that.Tuesday will see a marked “east-west split”, with the dry sunshine lingering along the eastern half of the countr, where temperatures will reach 22 degrees. Cloudy skies in the west will bring scattered showers and highs of 17 degrees.“Things change more noticeably on Wednesday,” Mr Murphy warned, adding that there will be “heavy and persistent rain” pushing up from the south. It will be a wet day for most of the country, although it should stay dry in Ulster. Munster will experience maximum temperatures of 15 degrees, while it could reach 22 degrees in northern counties.At the moment, Thursday looks as though it will start quite cloudy with showery outbreaks of rain, he said. The afternoon looks set to be drier, with temperatures again expected to surpass 20 degrees.Although scattered showers are predicted for the end of the week, Friday will start mostly dry with sunny spells. Met Éireann is predicting a slightly cooler day, with temperatures in the late teens.Mr Murphy cautioned that it is “too early to say” how the bank holiday weekend will play out, but currently it looks as though there will be a mix of sunny spells and showers.“It doesn’t look too bad at present. Temperatures are likely to be in the mid to late teens… That is subject to change,” he added.Meanwhile, the heat is bringing with it a high ultraviolet radiation (UV) index score of six to seven, meaning it is “vital” anyone spending time outdoors protects their skin against sunburn and skin cancer, the Marie Keating Foundation is warning.As sunseekers make a break for the beaches and green patches, the foundation is urging people to use sunscreen with factor 30+ protection, to wear protective clothing, hats and sunglasses, and to seek shade when the sun is at its peak between 11am and 3pm.Director of nursing with the foundation, Helen Forristal, noted that skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland, with 12,000 non-melanoma versions and about 1,200 melanoma skin cancers diagnosed in the country each year.There are “lots of misconceptions and a lack of understanding” of which sunscreens will protect against the sun’s harmful rays, she said.“It is key that you look for a brand that offers both UVA and UVB protection and is rated with five stars ideally. There are also many myths around how much sunscreen to apply and how long it lasts it is key that people get a better understanding, as rates of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, are on the rise,” she added.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"poots accuses eu of using northern ireland as a plaything","story":"DUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the European Commission of doing demonstrable harm to the peace process in Northern Ireland with the implementation of the Brexit protocol. Video: BBCDUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the EU of doing ‘demonstrable harm’ to the peace process. Photograph: Rebecca BlackPA WireDUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the EU for using Northern Ireland as a “plaything” over Brexit.He also accused the EU of doing “demonstrable harm” to the peace process and said he is concerned of violence this summer due to anger over the Northern Ireland protocol.Appearing on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Poots said once the grace periods on post-Brexit checks on goods from Britain ends, there will be 15,000 checks per week at the region’s ports – more, he said, than take place in Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest port.“We really need to ditch the protocol and ditch these checks because they are hugely damaging to the lowest paid workers,” he said.Mr Poots said although the European Commission over the years “put their heart and soul into winning peace in Northern Ireland”, they currently “don’t seem to care for the peace process . . . that really needs to change, that attitude needs to change, they are doing demonstrable harm to every inidual in Northern Ireland and it is having a devastating impact”.He said the UK government had the grounds to trigger Article 16 due to economic and societal damage, which he described as “very evident”.“This is the European Union seeking to punish the United Kingdom. As a consequence, Northern Ireland is being used as a plaything for the European Union,” the new DUP leader said.“I can assure you Northern Ireland should be nobody’s plaything, we are citizens of the United Kingdom, we were citizens of the European Union and we deserve to be treated with the same respect as everyone else.”Also appearing on the BBC programme, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic rejected Mr Poots’s “plaything” accusation.“We really do our utmost to make sure we demonstrate our total commitment to the Good FridayBelfast Agreement and therefore we’ve been looking for the four years for the best solution to the very sensitive situation in Northern Ireland.“I would like to hear from Mr Poots himself but also from other leaders of the political parties who form the Northern Ireland Executive, and discuss with them what we can do better,” he said.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the British and Irish governments and most people in Northern Ireland believed if there had to be checkpoints “the best place to have them is at one or two ports and airports, rather than multiple locations either within Northern Ireland, or along the six county Border”.The Government is “willing to explore any suggestions that people have that minimise the checks, minimise the disruption to trade between Britain and Northern Ireland”.Potential for violenceNewly ratified Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie warned against politicians playing up the threat of loyalist violence during the marching season as an inevitability.“I have concerns that there are people who are frustrated, there are people who are angry out there, and it certainly could turn violent,” he said.“But in the same respect, people do have the ability to demonstrate peacefully, and there is an opportunity to do that,” Mr Beattie said.“There is deep anger about the Northern Ireland protocol among the unionist population, but I think it is really important and it is incumbent on people like me to not play up violence but to play down violence.“I will stand with those that peacefully protest, I think that is important, but we do not need violence on our streets, and I think every politician needs to say that clearly, and not play it up as an inevitability,” Mr Beattie said.Speaking to Newstalk’s On The Record with Gavan Reilly, the UUP leader said tensions over the protocol along with pandemic restrictions easing and issues around policing in the North could contribute to “a perfect storm” over the coming months.The Upper Bann MLA insisted the post-Brexit arrangements create a “democratic deficit” in the North, which must continue to adhere to some EU rules under a deal struck by London and Brussels to avoid a hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland .The protocol was slowly undermining peace in the North and “will over the next coming months and years undermine it even more”, he said, adding: “It genuinely concerns me.”Mr Beattie also urged both Sinn Féin and the DUP to avoid a snap Assembly election, amid speculation Mr Poots will imminently reshuffle his ministers, a move his predecessor Arlene Foster has said will mean her resigning early as First Minister.An early election “would be destabilising, particularly in the environment there is now” and the two largest parties need to “keep the train on the tracks”, he said. – additional reporting PA How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Hector RetamalAFP via Getty ImagesWhen US president Joe Biden last week ordered US intelligence to intensify efforts to determine the origins of Covid-19, he gave fresh life to the theory that the virus may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Biden said US intelligence had “coalesced around two scenarios” – that the virus had either emerged naturally or was the result of a lab accident.It was the first time that the president had given credence to the possibility that the virus had leaked from a lab – a notion widely slammed as a conspiracy theory when Donald Trump first made the claim.Current and former officials said there were several reasons why the Biden administration was willing to publicly entertain a theory that Democrats had once slammed.A crucial factor was that critics were more open to the lab-leak theory now that Trump, who was viewed as wanting to vilify China to deflect blame for his handling of the pandemic, was out of office.They also said Biden was reacting to what the intelligence had found. He is now under political pressure to find answers.“The Biden administration has now studied the mountain of disturbing evidence that we were confronted with in the last few months of the Trump administration,” said David Asher, who led a state department investigation into the origins of Covid. “It is jaw dropping. And as they have noted, a great deal more needs to be assessed.”Days before Biden was sworn in, the state department issued a fact sheet on the Wuhan institute that said several researchers had fallen ill with Covid-like symptoms before the first publicly known case. It also said the institute had worked secretly with the Chinese military.Critics did not take the claim seriously because of the view that thren secretary of state Mike Pompeo tended to politicise intelligence. People were also focused on the aftermath of the riots on January 6th and Biden’s inauguration.“We assumed the fact sheet wasn’t going to make immediate headlines. We wanted to put the information into the record so that people could reckon with these facts when tensions and fevers had dropped,” said David Feith, a former state department official who was involved in the release.Lab-leak theoryIn March, Asher said publicly that some Wuhan staff were so sick they were hospitalised. That and a recent Wall Street Journal story that three staff were hospitalised, helped focus attention on the lab-leak theory.But one person familiar with the debate said the driving factor was a shift among scientists who had been wary of helping Trump before the election or angering influential scientists who had dismissed the theory. He said this had helped make Democrats more willing to consider the theory.“The most important thing that has happened is that prominent virologists have since spoken out,” he said.In a letter to the Science journal, a group of 18 prominent scientists said both theories were “viable” and should be taken “seriously” until sufficient data were obtained. They said the recent investigation that the World Health Organisation conducted with China had not given balanced consideration to both scenarios.“Even those of us working the issue inside the government were not well aware of how much scientific opinion was on our side because scientists were generally not speaking up, but you have had certain dams break over the past few months,” said Feith, referring to developments including the letter and the WHO investigation.Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to change his stance. Last year, he said the science “strongly indicates” the virus emerged naturally, but he recently said he was “not convinced” and backed an investigation.While Biden was just outlining the view of the intelligence community in his highly unusual statement, his willingness to make their tentative conclusions public also shone more attention on the lab-leak theory.Mathew Burrows, a former senior intelligence official, said he could not remember a president making such a statement, saying they have historically not wanted to be viewed as trying to force a conclusion.Political pressureMike Gallagher, a Republican congressman who has introduced a bill to declassify all the intelligence related to the investigation, also said that Biden appeared to be responding to political pressure, particularly after members of his team called on China to allow a transparent investigation – something few experts believe Beijing will allow.“Biden was feeling the pressure,” said Gallagher. “They felt a little bit of blowback ... but it’s a good move.”One person familiar with the situation said the National Intelligence Council, which collates information from the entire intelligence community, produced two reports last year assessing US intelligence on the origins of Covid. The director for national intelligence declined to comment.Those efforts, coupled with a third “scrub” of the intelligence this year, led to Biden saying last week that two of the 18 branches of the intelligence community leaned towards the natural origin scenario, while a third was more inclined towards the lab-leak theory.Biden said the three had only “low or moderate confidence” in their conclusions while the other branches did not have enough evidence. That has sparked concern that 90 days is not sufficient for intelligence officials to reach any solid determination.“The community as a whole is far away from reaching anything that we could call even a halfway firm conclusion,” said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official. “The fact that many of the agencies involved have not reached a consensus even for a ‘low confidence’ judgment tells you they’re a long way away from anything conclusive.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Denmark helped US spy against Angela Merkel and other European leaders say reportsCoronavirus latest news: Vaccine rush as Twickenham Stadium throws open its doors to all over 18sElectric car drivers are only £100 better off after 3 years than if they buy fuel versionClimate change kills 82 people in London every yearPlan to relocate Afghan translators to UK will be stepped upPrehistoric deer carvings discovered in Scottish Neolithic tomb in UK firstAfter a decade of ‘Bibism’, the Israeli right has decided it’s time for changeItalian winemakers see red over lack of emoji for rosé Benjamin Netanyahu\u0026#39s rivals vow to form new government within a weekAlex Salmond: Prince William should follow Queen’s example and stay out of independence debateComment: France\u0026#39s travel ban is really just spiteful Macron\u0026#39s latest Brexit punishment.

That makes him a very safe and secure choice.”An austere greybeard in a black-turban – a sign of descendancy from the prophet – Mr Raisi is a behind-the-scenes apparatchik who rose quickly through the ranks of the judiciary after the Islamic revolution, along the way developing close ties to the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mr Raisi also married well, to the daughter of the well-connected Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, Ahmad Alamolhoda. His father-in-law is “probably a force pushing this guy forwards,” said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran programme at the Middle East Institute. That facilitated his rise, allowing him to join Iran’s Assembly of Experts in 2006 – a prerequisite for any supreme leader – despite middling theological credentials, Mr Vatanka said.His behind-the-scenes rise took a public turn in 2017 when he ran in elections against President Rouhani, even though every incumbent since 1981 has won re-election. On the campaign trail he has travelled to neglected provinces to hear the grievances of the poor, blaming moderates like President Rouhani for weakness in the face of Western sanctions.  With Ayatollah Khamenei directing major decisions, Iran’s foreign policy would be unlikely to change drastically under a Raisi presidency, experts say, though his suspicion of the West is clear.But sanctions against him could be a sticking point amid ongoing negotiations over Iran and the United States returning to the nuclear deal. In 2019, as part of former president Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran, the US sanctioned Mr Raisi, charging him with administrative oversight of executions of minors, torture, and inhumane punishment. They also cited his involvement in the regime’s brutal crackdown on the Green Movement protests following the 2009 election. Should he win the election, President Joe Biden may lift sanctions on Mr Raisi for pragmatic reasons, said Leigh Hansson, a sanctions expert and partner at Reed Smith law firm. “It’s going to be difficult engaging with someone who is currently under sanctions by the US,” she said. “I think they’re going to have to do something specifically to remove those sanctions on him.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kings college apologises harm caused staff photo tribute prince","story":"One of Britain’s top universities has apologised for the “harm” caused to staff after they complained about being sent a photograph of Prince Philip who had a “history of racist and sexist comments”.The photograph of the late Duke opening the university library was included in a recent email bulletin to staff at King’s College London.However, a King’s College London spokesman later said that bosses at the institution remained “very proud” of its long association with Prince Philip.Joleen Clarke, associate director at the King’s College libraries, sent the email apology to staff after some workers complained about being offended by a photograph of the Duke featuring in a staff bulletin previously sent via email.Members of the university’s Anti-Racism Community of Practice reportedly reacted angrily to the photo, which showed the Duke alongside the Queen opening a library at King’s College in 2002, due to his “history of racist and sexist comments”.Vanessa Farrier, the college’s head of partnership and liaison, was reportedly among the staff angered by the Duke featuring in the email. In June, she was asked to “decolonise” the King’s College library.The Duke was notorious for his controversial comments, most famously for referring to “slitty eyes” during a 1986 trip to China.Ms Clarke was subject to what a source said was “a kangaroo court” among King’s College workers, who judged the use of the photo to be offensive.The offending photograph in the staff bulletin, sent shortly after the Duke died on April 9, was accompanied by a caption reading: “As the nation marks the death of HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, we thought you might like to see this photo of the Duke at the official opening of the Maughan Library in 2002, which some colleagues will remember.”“Through feedback and subsequent conversations, we have come to realise the harm that this caused members of our community, because of his history of racist and sexist comments. We are sorry to have caused this harm.”On Saturday a King’s College spokesman said: “As we previously highlighted in an official university tribute on April 9 2021, Prince Philip had a long association with King’s which continued right up until his retirement from public life. We valued immensely, and remain very proud, of his friendship and support for King’s.”The Duke’s association with the College began in 1955, when he became a Life Governor of the institution. He and the Queen visited King’s College many times, most recently in 2012, for the opening of its Somerset House East Wing (pictured below).The statement the spokesman referred to was released on the day of the Duke’s death. In it, Prof Evelyn Welch, King’s College\u0027s  interim principal, said that the Duke “always took an active and friendly interest in King’s and our students”.She said: “As a King’s community we mourn the loss of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and our sincere condolences are with HM The Queen, the Royal family and those close to him during this time.”In February the Government announced plans to protect free speech in universities, with education secretary Gavin Williamson warning of the “chilling effect” of students and staff not feeling safe when expressing opinions.Sir John Hayes, the Conservative MP, said: “King’s College London is at the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to inhibiting free speech. We need to flush out people in our universities who are determined with an almost Maoist zeal to close minds in places which ought to be bastions of free and open debate.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"life begins dont give stuff size","story":"I can’t say that I dropped my triple-chocolate-chip giant-size cookie in delight when I read that scientists have made a breakthrough in the genetics of obesity by identifying a new gene - MC4R. This gene, they say, causes a whopping 200,000 people to weigh an extra two and a half stone by playing fast and loose with a circuit of the brain that controls appetite.Sir Stephen O’Rahilly of the University of Cambridge said that the findings could aid the development of anti-obesity drugs and change attitudes. “Parents of obese children are often blamed, and not all children obtain appropriate professional help”, he says. “This should encourage a more compassionate and rational approach to overweight children and their families.”That’s all well and good - but your arteries don’t care if you’re fat because you have some mystery gene. This isn’t, however, some po-faced finger-wag about eating less and moving more I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say those words who wasn’t a complete bore.We’re often told that exercise is good for the brain, but if that were so, personal trainers would be today’s comedians, and sportsmen the great wits of yesteryear rather than, say, Oscar Wilde (fat) or Dorothy Parker (drunk, later fat). As Kingsley Amis put it, “No pleasure is worth giving up for the sake of two more years in a geriatric home at Weston-super-Mare.”Maybe you have the fat gene - but then again, you might just have the ‘fun’ gene or the ‘making excuses’ gene. The point is not to understand fat - but to transform it, if it bothers you.Of course, the usual pearl-clutchers and self-deniers will tut-tut that all people need is willpower. They’ll say that the state shouldn’t step in by proffering gastric bands or semaglutide, the new anti-obesity drug on the block, which trialled earlier this year and saw some people effortlessly lose up to four stone. Those who disapprove are probably the hair-shirt types who believe women should give birth with no more pain relief than a couple of soluble aspirins.If you think about it, the fact that so many of us are fat is actually a triumph of civilisation rather than a cue for condemnation. Whereas once food was so scarce that we\u0027d lay down fat at the drop of a sprat, human progress has given us such a horn of Cornucopia that all but the most self-controlled of us can easily start eating for two.I’ve always had an interesting relationship with my weight. As a teenager, I was so thin that my mother would cry when I went home to visit. In my thirties I got so fat that a magazine printed a photograph of Jabba the Hutt holding court, and said that it was me with my fan club.In my forties I discovered an amazing drug called Reductil - I’d be walking along Brighton seafront and have lost so much weight overnight that yet another skirt would fall down around my ankles, just like in a seaside postcard. Sadly - inevitably - it turned out to be hazardous to health and I packed the timber back on.In my fifties my son died and I lost a third of my body weight. The fact that the worst thing that ever happened to me was also the thing which caused the most people to say “You look great - I didn’t recognise you!” has made me sceptical about skinniness as the key to the kingdom of joy.The default setting for so many people is ‘When I’ve lost a stone…’ - but how miserable a way is that to live? The Stoics say that the secret of happiness lies in not taking for granted anything about the future. As Seneca said “Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing.” Thinking that your life is only going to ‘start’ once you’ve done X,Y or Z is a good guarantee that you’ll die unsatisfied.Now in my sixties I am a chubby, robust old lady, as yet unhindered by diabetes and blood pressure and not needing to see my doctor from one year to the next.At my time of life, to live a life in which your size is immaterial  - neither so big that you’re scared to go swimming, nor so small that you fall over and break your brittle bones - is the greatest luxury of all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"notre dame muslims foreign interference new mega mosque stirs","story":"In a packed, converted hangar in a suburb of Strasbourg, eastern France, a thousand men kneeled on mats for Friday prayers as an imam intoned in Turkish.Outside, hundreds more were obliged to place rugs on the tarmac of a courtyard for want of space. Between their prostrate forms and Mecca stood a football goal.“We’re lucky the sun is shining. When it rains, I can tell you, it’s not much fun. This place is too small,” said Volkan Duran, 49, vice president of Eyyup Sultan mosque.His prayers for more room may soon be answered.Just 100 yards away, construction is well underway for the hangar’s huge replacement with a prayer capacity of 2,500 and boasting an annex housing a school, restaurant, library and 14 shops, the new Eyyup Sultan mosque is destined to become one of Europe’s largest.On its website, owners Milli Gorus (National Vision), a Turkish diaspora organisation, trumpet that the Ottoman-style edifice will be “comparable in symbolism“ to Notre-Dame de Strasbourg, the world’s oldest Gothic cathedral and one of the tallest.However, in recent weeks, a row over the funding of the mosque has seen President Emmanuel Macron’s government accuse it of symbolising something far less flattering, namely “foreign interference” against its attempts to build an apolitical “Islam of France” and to stamp out Islamist “separation”.The spat highlights the minefield the government faces in cracking down on radicalism, upholding secularist laws and fielding complaints of a woeful dearth of dignified places of worship among France’s estimated six-million strong Muslim population, around two million practicing. Officials concede it could do with tripling the current mosque capacity.With France reeling from a spate of terror attacks - the most recent this week in which a known radical stabbed a policewoman before being shot dead - tackling Islamism has become a hot button issue, particularly ahead of this month’s regional elections and next year’s presidential ballot where Mr Macron is polling to once again to face far-Right leader Marine Le Pen.“Today he who finds a good enemy and makes a lot of noise wins the election and I think we are being used to this end,” sighed mosque president Eyup Sahin and regional head of Milli Gorus.“The best thing to do is to just grin and bear it,” he said while sipping mint tea.The controversy erupted in March after Strasbourg’s Green mayor accepted a request from Mr Sahin for a €2.5m subsidy out of a total budget of €32m. While the rest of France bans public funding of new religious buildings, Alsace and Moselle can do so due to a separate status dating back to when it was part of Germany.While the mayor said she was merely rubber-stamping a project already approved by her predecessors, the move prompted Gérald Darmanin, Mr Macron’s tough-talking interior minister, to accuse her of funding an organisation that “supports political Islam” and had links with the Turkish state.  Moreover, he said Milli Gorus, along with two other groups, was guilty of refusing to sign Mr Macron’s “Charter for the Principles of French Islam”, whose signatories accept Islam’s compatibility with the values of the French republic and gender equality and reject political Islam and the notion of apostasy.Mr Sahin said Milli Gorus had declined only because its representatives were not consulted and presented with a fait accompli “as if we were brigands that must now promise to abide by French laws. We have always abided by French law and our prime enemies are Islamic extremists,” he said.Furious at the setback for Mr Macron\u0027s ambitions to create an Islam of France, Mr Darmanin seized the funding request as a gift horse, said Fouad Douai, in charge of upkeep of the nearby grand mosque of Heyritz, which successfully received state funding in 2000.“By not signing the charter Milli Gorus provided him with the perfect opportunity to crack down on them. Meanwhile, the Green mayor made a blunder in good faith by starting her mandate with such a touchy subject while there was an ongoing nationwide row over Islam.“It was manna for extremists, with on the one hand Muslim ones able to say, ‘You see, look how they treat us’ and on the other those who claimed the town hall was funding radical Islam.”Mr Darmanin ordered a legal challenge to the planned subsidy, while government spokesman Gabriel Attal even claimed Milli Gorus had “no reason to organise activities or to exist in France”.  “Hopefully this opens everyone’s eyes and the ‘separatism’ law will soon be passed,” tweeted the interior minister.Approved by MPs in the National Assembly in February, and beefed up in the Senate in April, the bill notably requires all associations to commit to upholding “republican values” if they accept state subsidies.It cracks down on religious funding from countries such as Turkey, Qatar or Saudi Arabia by obliging associations to declare donations over €10,000 and have their accounts certified.The Right-wing senate majority later added bans on face coverings including for parents accompanying children on school outings. However, the centrist Macron camp opposed the move and it will now return to parliament for a final vote.Turkey’s firebrand president Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently blasted the planned law as a “guillotine of French democracy” that was “openly in contradiction of human rights, freedom of religion and European values” and called for its “withdrawal”.The Macron camp has accused him of meddling in domestic affairs.Mr Sahin denied any backing or funding from the Erdogan camp.“If so, why did construction stop for a year and a half?” he asked. “We have not received a single centime from the Turkish state.”Samim Akgonul, head of the Turkish studies department at Strasbourg University, said he believed that the truth lay somewhere in between.There was no doubt that Milli Gorus was politicised, which explained its refusal to sign the Macron charter on an Islam of France as it contains a clause pledging not to promote political Islam, he said.However, it was increasingly autonomous and not close to Mr Erdogan as it backed the Turkish opposition in the last elections, which could help explain why donations had run dry.The French government\u0027s opposition to granting it state aid highlighted a paradox, he went on.“A French association asking for funding from a French town is arguably proof of Milli Gorus’ growing autonomy and integration into an Islam of France. If you deny this mosque foreign funding but at the same time say it can’t have state funding, what can it do?” he asked.“But by refusing to see these populations as part of French society, the government is pushing them into Turkey’s hands whereas they are Strasbourgeois.”One mosque-goer, 25-year old engineer Omer Turhan, said: “I have studied in the UK and I can say that it’s far easier to practice one’s faith there in peace. Here, there is growing pressure from the far-Right.“We are French mosque-goers and feel singled out and stigmatised. What do they want us to do? Leave? Where? I’m French, I was born here and would be treated as a foreigner anywhere else. There is no logic.”At the building site, Mr Sahin inspected construction as a yellow crane towered over the mosque’s near-complete main dome while workers toiled on its two minarets.The mosque project, which would serve the 30,000-odd people of Turkish origin in Strasbourg, was approved in 2013, and the first stone was laid in 2017 in the presence of French officials and Turkey’s deputy prime minister. “All those who criticise it today supported and worked on the project bar the Greens. It\u0027s incomprehensible,” fumed Mr Sahin.  Given all the furore, he said that he had withdrawn his request for funding for now.“We may ask for it at a later date but with all the media coverage, our donations have shot up so we are hopeful of getting back on track,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"benjamin netanyahus rivals vow form new government within week","story":"Benjamin Netanyahu’s rivals branded him “dangerous and unhinged” as opposition leader Yair Lapid vowed to remove the Israeli prime minister from power and swear in a new government within a week.In a speech on Monday, Mr Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, confirmed that an agreement had nearly been reached on forming a cross-party coalition to replace Mr Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.“We can end this next week. In a week, the state of Israel can be in a new era with a new prime minister,” Mr Lapid said.It came after Naftali Bennett, a prominent right-winger, threw his support behind plans for the anti-Netanyahu coalition, in which he would initially serve as prime minister before rotating with Mr Lapid. If the coalition is sworn in, it could spell the end of the Netanyahu dynasty, which has dominated Israeli politics for more than a decade.It would also be an extraordinary rise to power for Mr Bennett, who despite winning just seven seats in elections last March now stands to become the next prime minister of Israel.Mr Bennett, a 49-year-old former special forces commando, is an erstwhile protégé of Mr Netanyahu but claims to be “more right-wing” than he is, and has warned that a “unity” government is the only means to avoid a fifth election.Read more: Naftali Bennett, the tough-talking right-winger poised to oust Benjamin NetanyahuHowever, the coalition process faces significant hurdles, in particular a brewing row over which party will be given the agriculture portfolio.Benny Gantz, the head of the Blue and White faction, sought to play down reports of an imminent new government on Monday as he warned that “ gaps and disagreements” remain in the talks. Mr Gantz is said to be withholding his support unless his party takes control of the agriculture ministry, prompting one right-wing leader to accuse him of trying to sabotage the coalition.“I wonder if his holy war for the agriculture portfolio is an excuse to dismantle the change bloc,” said Avigdor Liberman, the head of Yisrael Beiteinu, who is also competing for control of the agriculture ministry.Mr Liberman, a former Netanyahu ally, described the embattled prime minister as “mentally unstable,” citing a speech on Sunday where he compared attempts to oust him with the dictatorship in Syria.Mr Netanyahu had also accused Mr Bennett in the speech of committing the fraud of the century by trying to prop up a left-wing government.Mr Lapid also suggested that Mr Netanyahu was losing his grip on reality, branding his combative speech against the coalition as “dangerous and unhinged.”“If you want to know why we have to change the leadership in Israel, go and listen to Netanyahu\u0027s speech,” Mr Lapid said. “It was a dangerous and unhinged speech by someone who has no limits anymore. His weakness weakens us all.”  Mr Lapid went on to admit that the coalition still faced “obstacles,” which would need to be resolved by Wednesday night, when his mandate to form a government will expire.“There are still plenty of obstacles in the way of the formation of the new government. Maybe that’s a good thing because we’ll have to overcome them together,” he said.If the anti-Netanyahu coalition falls at the last hurdle then Israel would be forced to call its fifth election in just two and a half years.In parallel with the political crisis, Mr Netanyahu is standing trial on corruption charges which he strongly denies, and claims the trial is a politically motivated “witch-hunt.”But his opponents say the allegations of bribery and fraud are so severe that he is no longer fit to stand as prime minister.“In a week the state of Israel can be in a new era,” said Mr Lapid. “Suddenly it will be quieter, ministers will go to work without inciting, without lying, without trying to instil fear all the time.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china allows couples have three children major policy shift","story":"China announced on Monday that it would allow all couples to have up to three children as it grapples with an ageing population.The shift comes just three weeks after data showed a dramatic decline in China’s population growth, increasing fears about a looming demographic crisis in the nation of 1.4 billion.All couples have been allowed to have two children since 2016, when the government loosened its decades-old one-child policy. But after a rise in the number of births in 2016, the number of newborns has fallen every year since.Chinese say they are put off by the high costs of bringing up a child, as well as the rising costs of housing, healthcare and education. Pregnant women complain that employers discriminate against them, including demoting them, forcing them to resign or reducing their salary.Officials worry about a drop in marriages, a rise in orces, and a continuing fall in the number of women of childbearing age.The three-child policy change was approved during a Communist Party Politburo meeting on Monday chaired by President Xi Jinping, the official Xinhua News Agency announced.“China will introduce major policies and measures to actively deal with the ageing population,” it said.Party leaders “pointed out that further optimising the fertility policy, implementing the policy of one couple can have three children and supporting measures are conducive to improving China’s population structure,” Xinhua said. It did not say when the change would take effect.Without giving details, Xinhua also said authorities would “strengthen guidance on marriage and family values among young people of marriageable age”, “improve the maternity leave and maternity insurance systems” and “strengthen tax and housing support policies.”Data from a once-in-a-decade census released earlier this month showed population growth slipping to a record low in the 10 years to 2020. Annual growth averaged just 0.53 per cent over the past decade, the slowest rate since 1953.At the same time, the number of over-65s grew and the number of people of working age shrank, adding to strains on the economy and society of the world’s most populous country.  The public reaction online after the announcement suggested a lack of enthusiasm for having three children.“I suggest you first solve the basic maternity leave and workplace injustices that women have to face when they give birth before encouraging them to have children,” said one comment with more than 80,000 likes under Xinhua’s official Sina Weibo account.Another popular comment read: “If an only child marries another only child, they need to look after four elders and three children (and work long days). Even donkeys are not used like that!”  A poll on Weibo shared by Xinhua asking readers their reaction to the news later appeared to have been deleted after over 25,000 responded that they would not consider having three children.The Communist Party brought in its one-child policy in 1979 as a temporary measure to deal with a then-surging population. But it lasted for more than a generation. The policy was enforced by forced abortions and fines, and blamed for a skewed sex ratio where men and boys outnumber women and girls.The government credits the one-child policy with preventing 400 million births and helping lift numerous families out of poverty. But many demographers argue that China’s birth rate would have fallen anyway as its economy developed and education levels rose. Additional reporting by Wen XuMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china must open labs proper scrutiny","story":"The Covid blame game is gathering pace. Should the country have been shut down earlier? Were untested older patients decanted into care homes to spread the virus with deadly consequences? Were restrictions eased too rapidly last autumn, triggering another surge? These questions continue to be asked, not least following the evidence given by Dominic Cummings, the former No 10 aide, last week.On Andrew Marr’s weekly interview show on the BBC yesterday, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi was again pressed over whether the government should be held culpable for failing to tackle the crisis a year ago. As he pointed out, hindsight is a wonderful thing and while the shortcomings are now obvious, matters were not as clear in the early stages of a novel virus for which officialdom appears to have been woefully unprepared.Anger is directed at western governments, even by people who oppose the vaccination programme despite the fact it is the only way out of the lockdowns imposed to keep the virus at bay. Yet little of this fury seems to be directed where it should be – at the source of a contagion that has killed three million people around the world.For more than a year it has become the received wisdom that the virus emerged in a Chinese animal market in Wuhan. Anyone who has challenged this version (which the Chinese do not accept in any case) by suggesting it may have come from a research laboratory in the city is denounced as a conspiracy theorist.Now scientists are increasingly of the view that the virus may well have come from the lab, always a plausible explanation but one that was dismissed partly because it was promulgated by Donald Trump. His successor in the White House has now asked US intelligence agencies to investigate further. The World Health Organisation’s inquiry, which rejected the theory that the virus escaped, has been discredited as inadequate.It is reported that British intelligence agencies believe it to be “feasible” that the coronavirus emerged after a laboratory leak. Indeed most people would consider it bizarre that such an eventuality was ever ruled out when knowing where the virus came from is so important. The WHO seems more concerned with not offending China than discovering the truth. Social media platforms like Facebook had gone so far as to ban posts that suggested the virus might be man-made.A new study from UK Professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Dr Birger Sorensen, claims that Chinese scientists had created Covid-19 in a Wuhan lab before reverse-engineering versions of the disease to make it seem like it came from bats. They have concluded that the virus had no credible “natural ancestor” and it was “beyond reasonable doubt” that the disease was produced through “laboratory manipulation”. Not to investigate this properly would be criminally negligent, far more so than anything alleged against Boris Johnson or Matt Hancock.WHO’s director of emergencies, Dr Mike Ryan, was right to say that the politics of this issue should be separated from the science but it is Chinese state paranoia and secrecy that is the problem here. Beijing needs to be convinced that this exercise is not being carried out in order to attack them.When it comes to “lessons learned” the most important one is not whether tests worked properly or PPE was fully available, but why the pandemic happened in the first place. Lacking this knowledge, other forms of planning and preparation will be rendered useless.As David Davis, the former Cabinet Minister, observed at the weekend, the cover-up around the source of the virus is on a par with the Soviet Union’s efforts to pretend the Chernobyl nuclear disaster never happened. In many ways it is worse, since the impact on the world has been greater both in terms of fatalities and economic fallout.The leaders of the world’s foremost democracies will meet next month at the G7 summit in Cornwall. They need to apply the utmost pressure on Beijing to allow a full and open investigation into what happened. China needs to be convinced that this exercise is not being carried out in order to attack them but the regime must open up its labs to proper scrutiny.It is too late now to do anything about it, but it might stop a repeat of this calamity in future.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so

drivers would save an average of just £100 after three years compared to the petrol version of the same vehicles, research has found.The analysis by Halfords found that, while electric vehicles are on average 47 per cent more expensive to buy than petrol and diesel equivalents, drivers would likely still make a saving after three years because of lower running costs.Electric cars are seen as a major part of the UK’s push to reach net-zero carbon emissions, and the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from 2030.However, critics have warned that the higher cost of electric vehicles could prove prohibitive for many drivers, although the hefty upfront price tags would be expected to come down over time as more second hand models enter the market.Halfords analysed the biggest-selling electric cars which have a petrol or diesel equivalent, assuming an annual mileage of 10,000.Among the biggest savings after three years were £800 for those who bought an electric Mini Cooper Classic and £1,650 for a BMW i3, despite costing nearly £10,000 and £4,000 more upfront than their petrol or diesel counterparts.However, owning an electric Vauxhall Corsa would leave drivers £1,581 worse off after three years than a petrol Corsa, according to the analysis, although this cost would come down with further years of ownership.Andy Turbefield, head of quality at Halfords, said: “Intuitively we know that electric vehicles can be better value than their nearest petrol and diesel equivalents, but we wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to see it for themselves.”He added: “We’re not suggesting that people should buy electric because of the long term savings, but if people are delaying purchase because of the upfront cost, this should give them pause for thought.”Halfords has launched a calculator for those looking to compare the cost of electric vehicle ownership, including data for 102 electric, petrol, diesel and hybrid models.In some cases, electric vehicles were more expensive on a total cost basis, although Halfords said there are “numerous” examples where going electric is more economical.A recent survey by energy regulator Ofgem suggested that more than a third of households are unlikely to buy an electric vehicle in the next five years.Some of the most common reservations included the price of buying a vehicle, the availability of charging points across the country and the range of batteries.Only 13 models of electric vehicle are currently available for less than £30,000, the Public Accounts Committee recently said as it warned that urgent improvements are needed to infrastructure to meet the Government’s 2030 target.Analysis by the Policy Exchange think tank has suggested that chargers need to be rolled out at five times the current rate in order to provide proper coverage by that date.Last week the regulator pledged £300 million to improving the charging infrastructure and providing 3,500 new points.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality

a decade, it is difficult to imagine anyone other than Benjamin Netanyahu leading the Jewish state. But the elder statesman could soon be ousted by a pugnacious former tech entrepreneur who claims to be even more right-wing than his former mentor.Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Yamina movement, is poised to unseat Israel’s longest serving prime minister this week and serve as the head of a cross-party “unity” government. There are many parallels between the two figures, who both served as special forces commandos in their youth, speak fluent unaccented English after spells in the United States and adore the free market. They are also strong supporters of expanding settlements in the West Bank and despise the Iranian regime. This has prompted some Israeli commentators to dub Mr Bennett as Mr Netanyahu’s “Mini-Me,” in an unflattering reference to his bald spot. Born to American immigrants in the northern town of Haifa, Mr Bennett made his estimated $9m fortune as a tech entrepreneur before entering politics as an aide to Mr Netanyahu. Their relationship is said to have been a tumultuous one, with 49-year-old Mr Bennett leaving his role in 2008 after a falling out with his erstwhile political hero. Despite this, he named his eldest son Yoni after Mr Netanyahu’s brother, who was killed during an Israeli hostage rescue mission in Uganda in 1979. Mr Bennett entered national politics in 2013, when he took the helm of a pro-settler party and eventually rekindled his relationship with Mr Netanyahu, serving under him with portfolios in defence and education. He is also a former leader of the Yesha Council, a pro-settler lobby group, and draws much of his political support from his calls to annex the entire West Bank, which is claimed by the Palestinians as their own land. Much like Mr Netanyahu, his inflammatory rhetoric against Palestinians has on occasion landed him in hot water. In 2013, he said that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was something to be endured rather than resolved, comparing it to “shrapnel in the rear end.” In the same year, he reportedly said during a debate on whether to release Palestinian prisoners that “If you catch terrorists, you simply have to kill them.” He is said to have added: “I have killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there is no problem with that.” Allies of Mr Bennett say that his business acumen makes him uniquely well placed to steer Israel out of the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, which at one point saw unemployment rise to 20 per cent. But Mr Bennett himself has acknowledged that implementing his more controversial policies, such as annexing swathes of the West Bank, will have to wait. His potential coalition, which has not yet been finalised, will require a delicate balance of support from both the left and the right, as well as the centrist faction Yesh Atid. It may also depend on the external support of Arab members of parliament, which means any policies unfavourable to the Palestinians could fail to pass a vote in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. “Everyone will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams. We will focus on what can be done, instead of arguing over what is impossible,” Mr Bennett said in a speech on Sunday as he outlined his bid to become Israel\u0027s next prime minister. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"save us techno fascist covid dictator","story":"On Saturday, I travelled to London to get my jab. The Underground was packed. In a bizarre move, several lines were closed on a hot holiday weekend in the middle of a pandemic, forcing thousands of us onto the functioning routes like sickly sardines. After 18 months of staying two metres away from everyone, the one occasion when I was most likely to be exposed to Covid-19 was on my way to get the vaccine.There is no conspiracy. Only error. Trawling through Dominic Cummings’s evidence, which is the first real insider’s account of decision making during the pandemic, the picture that emerges is of a governing class that was ill-prepared and operating in the dark. Why, oh why, would we give these people any more power?Travel didn’t stop soon enough. Herd immunity was floated then abandoned. I suspect ministers saw what happened in Italy, feared our hospitals would be flooded too, and threw us into lockdown – despite not trusting us to obey it.As for the decision to discharge patients into care homes, which was like relocating Jaws, the disease, to a crowded swimming pool, one can infer a ruthless decision to free up beds to save the NHS. But perhaps ministers simply didn’t understand what conditions in the homes were, or how they were being managed.As with my Tube-ride through Hell, knowledge from the periphery doesn’t travel fast enough back to the centre.A period of national self-flagellation is now inevitable – one Labour MP called it an “alleged corporate manslaughter” – but you will struggle to find a Western nation where mistakes weren’t made, and one could trace the chain of misadventure all the way back to Wuhan, where it’s possible that the virus emerged not from Mother Nature but a laboratory.The refusal even to entertain Chinese responsibility at the beginning of the outbreak was another mistake, motivated in part by the need to believe that China is as efficient as it claims to be because the alternative is terrifying. Could it really be that we have filled our world with biological hazards and nuclear bombs only to leave them in the hands of a bored intern?In his superb book Doom, which I reviewed a few days ago for this paper, Niall Ferguson points out that so many errors contributed to the sinking of the Titanic that it’s hard to pin the blame precisely on one factor: disasters become more likely, he argues, when systems become too complex, exposing several points of vulnerability where a mechanical fault or human error can set off a chain reaction of bad decisions.It’s become that way with health, government and even the free market, which can no longer be relied upon to inject efficiency into public life.The greatest scandal of the David CameronGreensill lobbying affair was that no one could explain to me what Greensill does, at least in plain English. Much of financial services seems to hinge on capitalism having become so ridiculously complicated that you are forced to hire someone to navigate it for you its complexity disguises risk the case for regulation becomes impossible to communicate when the calamity is incomprehensible.What is the solution? The Cummings stratagem is to exploit our data to build a more efficient system – but this is discredited by China, because if a Wuhan lab does turn out to be the origin of this disease then that makes the world’s most prominent techno-fascist state guilty of a man-made disaster the equivalent of 100,000 Chernobyls. It’s also discredited by Dom’s own testimony. No 10’s attention was split between Covid, Iraq and Dilyn the dog, he complained – but it was his job to rank these priorities. I hit the panic button he insisted, but since when was it a virtue to panic?Among his big ideas was to use mobile phone masts and bank data to track our movements, jinxed, he grumbled, by the human rights and data protection laws – but while proposing the greatest, most horrific invasion of our civil liberties, he also admitted that it was “crackers” that he and Boris Johnson were in such positions of power. What we needed, he said, was a “Covid dictator”. Who? Dom nominated a chap called Marc Warner, who apparently runs a data company. Dom would have given Mr Warner “as close to kingly authority as the state has legally to do stuff, and pushing the barriers of legality”. This is quite mad, and monstrous.It’s no surprise that the elites will take away from this crisis that we need a bigger, more powerful government staffed by yet more elites, particularly ones that talk super-dooper-computer nonsense contrived to exclude people with real experience – teachers, doctors, carers, commuters – from the conversation. I offer an alternative: humility. Simplify structures so that we are not over-exposed to accident narrow the competencies of government so that when it does, inevitably, go wrong, the damage to our lives is reduced. And build in checks and balances that make a Covid dictator impossible or, at least, make it easier to keep tabs on one. Cummings was right about many things, particularly that we should always know who to blame. This can only happen if the line between cock-up and responsibility is as crystal clear and short as possible.

More, and crucially, different reform therefore seems necessary.“This is why it is important to continue to examine from all angles the factors that play into and construct the SEND system: which, as a whole, is characterised by \u0027nightmares\u0027 and \u0027dashed hopes\u0027, and which fails to serve the children it should be supporting.”Figures published last year showed that the number of parents asking for their summer-born children to delay starting school had increased annually since 2016.Government statistics showed that 1.2 per cent of summer-born pupils delayed entry in January 2020, up from one per cent in January 2019.Pauline McDonagh Hull, spokeswoman for the Summer Born Campaign, said: This study reaffirms the disproportionate number of summer born children with SEND in schools.One of the most important benefits of allowing compulsory school age entry is reducing new SEND diagnoses in summer born children and improving the educational outcomes of those already diagnosed.While we have seen improvements in the admissions approach taken by some authorities, equity concerns remain, and it is vital the government communicates the legal right to start school at age five instead of age four to all parents.Researchers for the study analysed the National Pupil Database census records for more than six million children in state primary schools over the years 2008 to 2018.The disproportionalities by birth season and gender were present throughout primary school, across cohorts of children, and were most pronounced between the ages of six and eight, the study suggested.A spokesman for the Department for Education said t5hat schools should make sure that children get the right level of support whatever age they start school.She added: “Schools should also consider whether a child has a learning difficulty based on monitoring their progress, but a child needing SEN support does not mean they will be permanently labelled as having special educational needs, or that they will always require support.”The Government is currently reviewing the system and looking at ways to make sure it is consistent.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain faces early third covid","story":"NewsBritain faces early third Covid wave amid calls for June  lockdown exit delayProfessor Ravi Gupta, who sits on Whitehalls New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , blamed the Indian iant for fuelling a fresh surge of infectionsmirrorShare, blamed the Indian iant for fuelling a fresh surge of infections\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _BRITAIN-HEALTH-VIRUS.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\", blamed the Indian iant for fuelling a fresh surge of infections\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _BRITAIN-HEALTH-VIRUS.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\", blamed the Indian iant for fuelling a fresh surge of infections\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _BRITAIN-HEALTH-VIRUS.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"CommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe final stage of the roadmap would see an end to remaining restrictions on social contact \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He backed delaying step four of Boris Johnsonaposs lockdown roadmap, due for June , by a few weeks to tackle the rise in disease. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the Government would not rule anything out but stressed it was too early to make a decision. The Government is facing growing calls from scientists to push back the final stage of unlocking, which would see remaining restrictions of social contact lted. Shuttered businesses such as nightclubs would also be allowed to open under the plan.  But a surge in cases of the Indian iant in hotspots across the country has triggered alarm from some experts. The number of Covid cases between May  and May  - , - was .% higher than the previous seven days. Prof Gupta told the BBC: “There has been exponential growth in the number of the new cases and at least three-quarters of them are the new iant. Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave. It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a  sense of security for some time, and thataposs our concern. Prof Gupta said vaccination rates were not too far from the levels needed to contained the virus but urged caution of lting restrictions.  He said: I think that people are not saying we should abandon the June  date altogether but just to delay it by a few weeks while we gather more intelligence and we can look at the trajectory in a clearer way. If you look at the costs and benefits of getting it wrong, I think it is heavily in favour of delay, so I think thataposs the key thing. Yes, we will learn to live with it but this date that was set did not take into account the fact we would have a new iant on the horizon, with properties that allow it to evade antibodies to some extent and a virus which is more transmissible. Professor Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London and a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, told Sky News: Weaposre on a kne-edge. We could go either way with this new iant.Either it could run away as it did before Christmas, which would be extremely serious and weaposd have to have more restrictions, or potentially it could be contained.But that does mean everybody needs to be cautious right now.Everybodyaposs behaviour could potentially make the dference. So the key thing at the moment is for people to do their socialising outdoors, andpeople are inside, make sure windows and doors are open. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told Times Radio said: The concerns are that this is a much more transmissible iant.Weaposve still got lots of people still to vaccinate – and absolutely hospitals are very busy.Weaposre talking to people who are saying, aposWeaposve got -% bed occupancy, this is not the kind of bed occupancy we would normally expect this kind of year at a time of yearapos.Weaposre trying to go full pelt, to recover those care backlogs, we seem to be getting more people coming in on the urgent and emergency care pathway than we were expecting.So when youaposve got those volumes of patients, even small numbers of Covid- patients clearly add to the pressure. Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “The decision to continue easing restrictions on June st must be taken based on data to keep people safe and prevent overwhelming the NHS.The single biggest threat to that is ministerial incompetence.Today ministers remain engulfed and distracted by internal rows and blame shting at just the moment we need a laser like focus on this iant. “Weak, slow decisions on border policy let this iant in, continued lack of sufficient self-isolation support and a stand off with local public health directors over vaccination policy failed to contain it.For June st to go ahead, ministers must learn from their earlier mistakes.” The Prime Minister is expected to confirm whether June  freedoms will go ahead on June , as officials pore over the data. The impact of any new iants is one of the key factors the decision will be based on. Mr Eustice told BBC: We canapost rule anything out. We know this has been a dficult pandemic, a dynamic situation.

Boris Johnson’s delay in banning flights from India, where the most worrying Covid iant originated, jet-fuelled its spread. The rise in cases is concerning but is not increasing hospital admissions or deaths.  The NHS reports that “very, very few” patients admitted with the virus are double-jabbed, so the vaccination programme works. With the Government still looking at making NHS and care jobs dependent on vaccination, it should remember that persuasion and education are better than coercion. The truth is that even existing vacancies can’t be filled, never mind creating new ones. Dreaded bliss  Controversy follows Boris Johnson everywhere, even down the aisle to his secret wedding on Saturday. The answer to disgruntled Catholics asking why the twice-orced Prime Minister was allowed to marry for a third time in Westminster Cathedral is that it was his first wedding within the faith. The previous two were not. The more pressing question for most people is whether Johnson paid for his own wedding. If a wealthy friend covered any of the bill, their identity and the amount should be made public, to avoid potential conflicts of interest. That a signicant number of voters even wondered about the cost is a shadow cast by Johnson’s previous unacceptable behaviour. Real values How reassuring that most of us would prefer to be remembered as a good friend rather than for success or wealth. Because relationships matter more than earnings and career... though a well-paying job is more likely to foster happiness than never having two pennies to rub together.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSBoris JohnsonHospitalsMarriagePoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"june 21 lockdown end realistic","story":"NewsJune  lockdown end - realistic chances Boris Johnson will change roadmap explainedThe final step to freedom is due to take place within weeks, with all legal limits on social contact ditched.

Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap has so far gone as planned, with the first three stages taking place on the promised dates in March, April and May. But Step  - which will come no earlier than June  - could be derailed by the spread of the new strain in parts of the country, with some experts calling for the final easing of restrictions to be pushed back. The Government insists it is just too early to say, as officials pore over Covid data to seethe battle between the vaccine and the virus is being won. And evenit does go ahead as billed, some social distancing restrictions could still be in place for longer.  The public has learned from bitter experience how quickly things can change, so all eyes will be on the data in the coming weeks. Hereaposs what we know about the plan to lt the last lockdown restrictions - and whether it will go ahead. What rules are due to change on June   Mr Johnson set out a four-step roadmap out of lockdown back in February, with a phasedto normal le. Most restrictions have now lted, such as the ban on foreign holidays and overnight stays, and pubs, restaurants, retail, galleries and and cinemas have been able to reopen. In Step , the Government aimed to remove all legal limits on social contact, which means any number of people can meet up both indoors and outside. This means you can legally have any people as you want over to your house for dinner or for a picnic in the garden. It also means shuttered venues like nightclubs can reopen, as more people are allowed inside together, and crowds couldto big events like festivals and gigs. Pilots have been taking place to test how big events can . Crowds attended the Brit awards earlier this month, while clubbers ed to the dance floor for trial events in Liverpool at the start of May. It will also factor in whether big weddings can take place, as the current rules allow no more than  guests. Separate reviews are also underway into use of vaccine passports for events and whether social distancing measures can be ditched. Some measures such as face coverings could stay in place for longer as reports suggest the Government may prioritise scrapping the aposone-metre plusapos rule to allow businesses to serve more customers.  How will the Government decide whether to unlock on June   Officials are poring over the data to see whether it is safe to ease restrictions further. Under the roadmap, four key tests must be met before the next step can go ahead. They are:That the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully That evidence shows jabs are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated That infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which puts unsustainable pressure on the NHS That the Government’s assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new iants of concernThe final test about new iants is the critical one here - and whether the Government decides the risk from the Indian strain is too great to move forward. The PM is expected to announce his decision on June , to give businesses a week to prepare.  How much of a threat is the Indian iant  The new strain of the virus has been causing alarm because it is thought to be spreading more quickly than previous iants. The PM is waiting for key data on its transmissibility before he makes the final decision about June . The Governmentaposs advisers recently suggested it could be up to % more infectious, but other analyses have offered lower figures. It is now the dominant strain in the UK, taking over from the Kent iant which ripped across the country in the winter. Cases and deaths have risen in the UK over the past week, linked to the new spread of the iant.Between May  and  there were  deaths reported within  days of a positive coronavirus test, an increase of .% compared with the previous seven days. There were a further , lab-confirmed cases on Sunday, with the number of cases between May  and May  - , - .% higher than the previous seven days. But the success of the vaccine rollout means the country is in a much better place to see off the virus - as long as the jabs work against it. A recent study by Public Health England found the Pfizer jab was % effective against the Indian iant after two doses, while AstraZeneca was % effective. However both were only % effective against the Indian iant three weeks after the first dose. More than  million people have been given a first jab and a further . million have had both doses. The Government has accelerated the vaccine rollout to try to get as many people fully jabbed as possible. All over-s are set to have had both doses by that date under a target set out by vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. But many younger people are still waiting to be called up for their first dose - and there are still examples of vaccine hesitancy. What do the experts say about June   A growing number of scientists have been calling for the final stage to be delayed to give more time to see whether hospitalisations from the new iant are going up. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said that with the UK in the grip of an early third wave -and urged ministers to push back June  by a few weeks. He said the country was not too far from reaching the sort of levels of vaccination that would help us contain the virus, echoing calls from other experts to wait until more people have had both jabs.  Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there had been some encouraging data but the impact of the easing of restrictions in May would not be known until around about June  or just before that. NHS Providers boss Chris Hopson said hospitals are busy with the backlog of non-Covid cases - and even a small uptick in cases could have a big impact. He told Times Radio: The concerns are that this is a much more transmissible iant. Weaposve still got lots of people still to vaccinate. And absolutely hospitals are very busy. Weaposre talking to people who are saying aposWeaposve got -% bed occupancy, this is not the kind of bed occupancy we would normally expect at this time of yearapos. What does the Government say  The tone from the Government has become more muted in recent days, despite pressure on Mr Johnson to stick to the June  date. Tory MPs have been pressing the PM to lt restrictions to help struggling businesses and give people back their freedoms. And Mr Johnson will be keen to stick to his promise after so many u-turns and last minute decisions last year. The Prime Minister warned on Thursday that we may need to wait for more information but said I donapost see anything currently in the data to ert from the June  date. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs it was too early to tell whether England can take the final step to freedom.  On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice also said we canapost rule anything out when asked about whether the date should be delayed. He told the BBC: Iaposve said all along, as has Matt Hancock and the Prime Minister, we canapost rule anything out because we know this has been a dficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. It will only be by then that we will see the full impact of the latest easements we made on May , so I know everyone wants to know what is going to happen but we canapost actually make that judgment until we see the impact.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"after miracle baby kidney transplant","story":"NewsAfter miracle baby, kidney transplant means I can be best mum possibleEXCLUSIVE: The Law For Le change, which brought about the new opt-out donor register after years of campaigning by the Mirror, has given a double gt of le for mum Jackie and daughter PoppymirrorShareCommentsByWarren MangerFeatures Writer:,  MAY NewsIn , poppy and mum Jackie have a new lease of le \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Jackie defied the odds – and doctors’ fears for her safety – to give birth to Poppy while waiting for a kidney ­transplant four years ago. But family holidays were impossible as Jackie had to spend five days a week hooked up to a dialysis machine to clean her blood and keep her alive. In January, just as the country was going back into lockdown, she got the call she had hoped for since her kidneys began failing seven years earlier. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  A suitable organ had been found after the new opt-out donor register launched a year ago as a result of the Mirror’s Law for Le campaign. As we revealed on Thursday, new figures show that since the law changedalmost  people have donated their organs having not previously specied any wishes.Jackie, , from Castle Donington, Derbyshire, said: “It has been le-changing. I can’t wait to take Poppy to the seaside, so she can feel the sand between her toes and paddle in the sea. “Before my transplant, we couldn’t go on holiday because my dialysis machine was too big and heavy to take with us. It even affected Christmas.  “We often missed out on things because I had to do dialysis. It was hard, not knowing how long I would have to wait for a transplant and how much Poppy would miss in that time.”In summer  Jackie was overjoyed to find out she was pregnant, two years after being diagnosed with IgAnephropathy, a harmful build-up of antibodies which damaged her kidneys.At that time her illness was controlled with tablets, although she would eventually need dialysis and a transplant. But she had no idea it could stop her having children until she told doctors.  Jackie said: “They were surprised I was able to get pregnant and because of the risk to me and my baby, the medical advice was to terminate, then wait until I’d had a transplant before trying again. “I was devastated. I knew this could be my only chance to be a mum and it might be taken away. I hadn’t even started dialysis, it could be years before I had a transplant.” Health and safety adviser Jackie used her training to start researching the risks and the likely outcomes of pregnancy for patients suffering kidney failure to help her make a “logical decision”. Jackie said: “At that point I realised how rare this was, because there was no information for people like me, just a handful of articles in medical journals that were full of jargon I didn’t understand.  “But deep down I’d already made up my mind. If this was my only chance to be a mum, I wasn’t giving up. I wanted to give my baby a chance.” Jackie had weekly check-ups and started dialysis three months into the pregnancy as her kidneyplunged to just %. To minimise the amount of time she spent in hospital, she decided to have dialysis at home. It meant being hooked up to the machine for six hours at a time, five nights a week. Jackie said: “It was exhausting. Some nights I struggled for an hour just to get the needles in and the sound of the machine kept me awake. I sat and cried while everyone  was asleep.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Despite the doctors’ concerns and an apparent lack of amniotic fluid during one antenatal scan, the pregnancy went well and Poppy was delivered by caesarean section in January . Jackie’s renal team, who became like “extended family” during the pregnancy, even visited her and Poppy on the maternity unit. Jackie said: “Holding Poppy for the first time was the best feeling ever. All those sleepless nights, all the trauma trying to put the needles in, it was all worthwhile, because I’d done it for her. “It was so lovely that my renal team all came in on a Sunday to see me and meet Poppy – they played such an important part in making sure she arrived safely.” After the birth Jackie asked to be placed on the transplant waiting list, hoping that would improve her health so she could be the best mum possible to Poppy. But she had to wait  months before joining the list, as doctors would not approve such major surgery while she was caring for a newborn baby. In the meantime Jackie juggled dialysis with breastfeeding, work, and caring for Poppy. That became even more ­challenging after she split from Poppy’s dad during lockdown last year. She was even temporarily taken off the waiting list after a virus caused her heartto drop. Jackie finally received the call telling her a matching kidney had been found in January and her new kidney was implanted in her groin without removing either of her existing organs. She spent five days recovering alone at Nottingham City Hospital as no ­visitors were allowed. Jackie said: “It was such a shock to get the call, I didn’t think it would happen in the middle of the pandemic because I knew a lot of units had been forced to suspend transplants. The worst thing was not being able to see Poppy, we had never been apart for that long. When I got home she wouldn’t let me go anywhere without holding my hand to make sure I was OK.” Jackie’s kidneyhas increased since her transplant and is now %. She has ed her dialysis machine – a milestone moment – and turned her “dialysis room” into a home office. Jackie said: “I feel so lucky to be able to live a normal le now. For the first time since Poppy was born, we don’t have to organise our lives around my dialysis machine. “Once we’ve been on holiday, I plan to write to my donor’s family and tell them what a dference my transplant has made, not just for me, but for Poppy and the rest of my family. “I want them to know what a wonderful thing they have done. I hope that will bring them some comfort.”For more information about the opt-out donor register and how to discuss your wishes with your family, visit: organdonation.nhs.uk FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBabiesHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthNewborn babyOrgan donationChange the Law for Le campaign"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful mum took life after","story":"NewsBeautul mum took her own le after questioning ability to be parent, inquest told\"Bright and beautul\" Catherine Hennelly, , had sought help for bipolar disorder and \"tried very hard to get better\" before she died by suicide, her sister saysmirrorShareByAlec Whitaker:,  MAY NewsMum-of-one Catherine Hennelly regularly ran k races to raise money for charity \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Catherine Hennelly, , was found hanged at her home after seeking help for bipolar disorder and showing positive signs of improvement. The mum-of-one, who regularly ran k races to raise money for charity, had been due to take up a lecturing post at Manchester University when she was found dead on December , .Her then eight-year-old son, who lives with his father, had been due to visit her and that had made her happy, the inquest was told. Miss Hennelly had originally worked as a researcher for Goldman Sachs before joining the staff at Xaverian Roman Catholic sixth form college in Rusholme, Manchester.  She worked as a politics tutor and then also a careers manager at the college for almost  years but it is thought she left in August , eight months after being treated in a hospital mental health unit following an overdose and a month after she admitted herself to AE due to a a further medical episode. Thomas Walker, a senior social worker assigned to Miss Hennelly, told the hearing that he became her key worker after she attended the AE of Wythenshawe hospital with thoughts of harming herself in July .  He said: The following month I visited her at home to get a mental state examination to monitor her mood thoughts and any concerns. She appeared to be in a low mood and was concerned about her ability to be a mum to her son. She spoke about not wanting to live her le anymore, but had no intent to harm herself. She wished to continue to engage with the mental health services and comply with her medication. She had some financial issues and I passed the information over to a psychiatrist.  Mr Walker said he visited Miss Hennelly at home on September ,  and her mood had improved since his last visit and she told him she had a job interview coming up. He added: She had thoughts about not wanting to live, but had no intention of harming herself. She said she was suffering from the side effects of her medication. The following month, as he arranged a third home visit, Miss Hennelly described having fleeting suicidal thoughts and a dference in her thoughts, saying she was able to push them out of her head and get on with her le. Mr Walker added: It was a more positive indication in respect to her condition. Days later, on November , , Miss Hennelly attended a psychiatric unit where she repeated a similar description of how she was thinking but she appeared to be stable, he said. Mr Walker said she was discharged and the last contact he had with her was about two weeks before her death. Another social worker, Sofina Bibi, told the inquest that she visited Miss Hennelly at her home on December , .  The college lecturer told of having side effects of her medication, which was making her sleep more, the inquest heard. Ms Bibi added: She was happy her son was going to visit her at home. She was also about a new job she was due to be starting. She was engaging with me in a positive way. I went to see her around one week later on December  but there was no answer at the door. A neighbour came around and explained to me she had been found dead by hanging. It was a great shock because she had been so positive one week earlier. Stephen Marks, a mental health nurse who led an investigation into the treatment of Miss Hennelly, said she had previously attempted to harm herself in  and , and had been diagnosed with type  bipolar effective disorder. Miss Hennelly was engaging with the mental health services and was showing positive signs of improvement in her mental health, he said. Mr Marks added: Sadly you can never eliminate the risk of people harming themselves. Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows recorded a conclusion of suicide. He told the hearing: It is a very sad series of events. I offer my condolences to the family for your loss. Whatever help and assistance can be given, some patients will still go on to kill themselves, because it is impossible to prevent every death. Miss Hennellyaposs family have raised £, for the mental health charity MIND.Her sister Claire said: She was just a bright and beautul woman, very enthusiastic and very friendly and so open about her illness and her battle.

Both areas have reported some of the highest numbers of cases of the Indian iant, with Bolton recording , up to May  – the highest in the country – and Blackburn recording . Health teams in both local authorities have been running surge testing for the virus, along with “surge vaccinations” to boost take-up among everyone who is eligible for the vaccine.

Cancerous tumours need food to spread, so they consume the bomb which has a drug inside it. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh combined the tiny cancer-killing molecule SeNBD with a chemical food compound to trick malignant cells into ingesting it. The peer-reviewed experimental study was carried out on zebrafish and human cells, but researchers say more studies are needed to confirmit is a safe and swt method of treating early stage cancer and drug-resistant bacteria. Healthy cells are not harmed by the drug and it only works against cancer cells because they grow fast and need more food than the healthy ones.  Scientists hope that with this discovery the new treatment will increase survival rates and also prevent patients from having to go through chemotherapy. Itaposs only been tested on glioblastoma so far, which is the most common type of brain cancer. Tests showed that the sugar bomb destroyed the sugar-craving cells in the tumour in mere seconds. By coupling SeNBD with a chemical food compound it becomes the ideal prey for harmful cells which ingest it without being alerted to its toxic nature. The drug was invented by University of Edinburgh researchers who compared it to a Trojan Horse, and its effects to a metabolic warhead. SeNBD is also a light-activated photosensitiser, meaning it kills cells only after it is turned on by visible light. It could tackle breast, prostate and lung cancers. And Nature Communications has reported that the treatment will also be adapted for cancers that prefer consuming fat or protein. With the treatment, a surgeon can precisely decide when they want to activate the drug, reducing the chances of it destroying healthy tissues and avoiding side-effects like hair loss caused by other anti-cancer agents, said the university. Lead researcher Professor Marc Vendrell, chair of translational chemistry and Biomedical Imaging at the University of Edinburgh, said: This research represents an important advance in the design of new therapies that can be simply activated by light irradiation, which is generally very safe. SeNBD is one of the smallest photosensitisers ever made and its use as a aposTrojan horseapos opens many new opportunities in interventional medicine for killing harmful cells without affecting surrounding healthy tissue. Dr Sam Benson, a post-doctoral researcher at the university, said the mechanism of the drugaposs delivery means it goes through the front door of the cell rather than having to find a way to batter through the cellaposs defences.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCancer"},{"url":null,"title":"brits pack beaches soak up","story":"NewsBrits pack beaches to soak up Bank Holiday sun as council issues crowds warningAfter months of lockdown and with international travel options made dficult by test and quarantine requirements, the Great British seaside has proved a hugely popular draw on the final day of MaymirrorShareCommentsByMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSunbathers and holidaymakers have flocked to the beach \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

After months of lockdown and with international travel options made dficult by test and quarantine requirements, the Great British seaside has proved a hugely popular draw today. Photographs from beaches across the UK show sun starved people revelling in the sea and sand. One council, Thanet in Kent, has warned people to turn back at Broadstairs, Margate and Ramsgate,beaches are too crowded, reminding people weaposre not back to normal just yet. The rush to get the beach has been so intense that some cars have been turned away while trying to park up. Next to the shadow of Brighton Pier hundreds of groups of people - all appropriately distanced from one another - could be seen relaxing in the balmy weather.In Bournemouth one man whizzed along a zipline above the sea to get a view of the famous beach, which attracts thousands of people when the sun is shining. Camber Sands in Sussex was typically heaving, providing a predictable logistical problem for those wanting to park up near to the miles long sandy beach front. And Lyme Regis in Dorset was a riot of colourful parasols and windbreakers as far as the eye could see.  It seems that everybody got the memo that this Bank Holiday Monday was going to be one to remember weather-wise. The Met Officeaposs forecast shows bright, uninterrupted sunshine throughout the UK for almost the whole day. Only parts of the west coast of the Isles will get some cloud later in what is due to be an absolute scorcher. The best of the weather is to be had in the South East, where the mercury is forecast to rise as high as C come this afternoon. If it reaches its predicted potential then today will officially be crowned aposs hottest so far, beating March aposs .C recorded in Kew Gardens. Elsewhere in the country the temperature will likely peak at a still very reasonable C. The scorching weather has ensured even those without ready beach access are finding ways to cool off in the water.In London paddler boards could be seen leisurely wending their way down the cityaposs canals, while boys stood in the waterfall like stream of Warleigh Weir in Somerset.There are reports of cars being turned away from Formby Beach in Merseyside as thousands flock to enjoy the sun. If you are thinking of heading to the coast today please consider re-routing or delaying your journey to avoid the congestion, Transport for Great Manchester warned.Research suggests up to . million car journeys could be made, meaning some unlucky would be beach-goers may find themselves missing out. RAC traffic spokesman Rod Dennis said: After what was one of the quietest Easters on the roads in years, our figures suggest the easing of Covid restrictions has made a dramatic dference, with millions more drivers planning to hit the roads.Becky Mitchell, a meteorologist from the Met Office, said: “We will see highs of C, most likely in parts of Wales and the Midlands and in north-west England as well on Sunday, it’s likely we could get to .C.We are expecting highs of C tomorrow, so the warmest day of the year so far, and both today and tomorrow we will see temperatures in the low s in most parts of the UK, even in northern Scotland.” The weather today is a welcome tonic after one of the worst Mayaposs in living memory.  The month so far has been one dominated by low pressure, bringing heavy downpours or prolonged spells of rain for much of the UK. Wales has seen its wettest May since records began in , with mm of rainfall, well over twice the long-term average, topping the previous record of mm set in .

The letter told them to be gone by Monday unless they can provide evidence of another address as their main residence. Several residents - who pay £, a year to rent the plot - have lived in the park for decades, including one man who has lived there for  years. Residents usually go abroad or stay with family for two months per year. This year they helped each other through lockdown and developed a strong sense of community. Some of the residents have already left the caravans following the letter, but others call the park their home and are refusing to budge. In a joint letter to Jane Hutt, Walesaposs Social Justice Minister, they said: Facing eviction, these people have become acutely stressed and distressed beyond any words I can express.  Many are elderly, most have ploughed le savings into buying static homes where they believed they could remain for the remainder of their lives. Residents claim they were told by Jane Hutt and Vale of Glamorgan council that no action would be taken against them for being stuck in the park through lockdown. Iaposm going to lose my home, said Craig Sullivan, who lives at the park and stays with his parents for two months of the year. “Theyaposll have to drag the caravans off us. Weaposre not moving and it will become a riot field on Monday. Itaposs putting people under so much stress and worry.  He added: Weaposre like a proper big family. Weaposre always going round to each othersapos making dinner. “We feel like weaposve been victimised and Monday will be World War Three here. Jo OaposDonovan, who bought her caravan in  with her parentsapos inheritance, said: I was never asked for any documents about council tax, utility bills, whether I owned my own property or whether I was a sitting tenant. I was just asked for a postal address, which I did provide. Iaposm absolutely distraught, she added.  Bryan and Clare Newell own a flat in Llandaff but have been unable to live there since  due to an ongoing issue with developers. Because we stayed here in January and February, we are now being punished, said Mr Newell. One pensioner, -year-old Reg White, left his caravan on May  after two and a half years, and must now live with his sister in Devon. Iaposm feeling gutted, said Mr White. Itaposs horrible leaving my home. The Porthkerry Caravan Park owners have been approached for comment.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCaravansCoronavirus lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"climate change puts future cliff","story":"NewsopinionClimate change puts future on a clf edge as homes in danger of disappearingCoastline erosion has always taken place, but it is now accelerating due to climate change - .m properties in England are believed to be at riskmirrorShareCommentsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  MAY NewsopinionEdd Canes home on the clf edge in Eastchurch, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Lorry driver Edd, , lives in a house on the clftop with we Lynn, . They were hoping to enjoy their ­retirement there. But that dream has turned to “heartbreak” because their much-loved home, where they have lived for  happy years, is in danger of disappearing. It is now just five yards from the edge of the clf, which began to crumble last year, sending his ­neighbour’s property tumbling into the sea. I visited Edd and other ­residents living at Eastchurch Gap on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. His is just one of the . million properties in England believed to be at risk from flooding and coastal erosion. His and neighbouring homes are now worthless, seeing a letime of hard graft being washed away. I’ve found similar heartbreaking stories around the UK including Fairbourne in Wales and Hemsby in Norfolk.Although erosion of our coastline has always taken place, it is now accelerating due to climate change. Extreme weather, such as superstorms, occurs more often, resulting in stronger winds, more intense rain, higher tides and bigger waves.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below...  Worryingly, homes inland are also at risk of damage caused by climate change.A new study from the British Geological Survey has warned of the growing threat of subsidence which will cause damage due to the shrinking and swelling of the ground. And it will worsen as the UK faces more weather extremes as a result of rising global temperatures.London and the South East are most at risk due to clay-rich soils that absorb lots of water in wet weather, causing the ground to rise and structures to lt. In hot, dry weather, soils can get hard and the ground shrinks and cracks, causing subsidence.  The study found how the number of properties across Britain highly likely or extremely likely to be affected by“shrink-swell” could rise from % or nearly one million in  to .% or more than .million in . By , almost %, or more than four million properties, could be impacted.It will not be possible to stop every home from crumbling into the sea. But action to drastically cut emissions will help to prevent many lives from being financially destroyed.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnClimate changeWeather"},{"url":null,"title":"covid watchlist identifies 20 hotspots","story":"NewsCovid watchlist identies  hotspots as Indian iant fuels third wave fearsTameside, the city of Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and Leicester have been placed on a coronavirus watchlist by researchers from the weekly Zoe Covid Symptom StudymirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video new-hybrid-indian-kent-covid-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:YuAkiNW,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Reassuringly, we aren’t seeing numbers rise in other surrounding areas. Our data also indicates vaccines are still effective against the Indian iant and this is likely the reason why cases haven’t increased and hospitalisation and deaths remain low. Also important to remind ourselves that our national rates are still amongst the lowest in Europe, despite other countries travel restrictions ” The study also found that a small proportion of people who have been vaccinated against Covid have become infected with the virus. Researchers collected reports from  app users who tested positive for coronavirus despite receiving two doses of a vaccine. A further  reported testing positive after receiving one dose. The study suggests the approximate risk of Covid infection in unvaccinated Brits is  in ,. The estimated risk of catching the virus after one vaccine dose is one in ,, and for those who have received two jabs it is one in ,, said researchers.

It comes amid calls for next month’s unlocking in England to be delayed. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said the UK was in the grip of an “early” third wave of Covid- infections and the June  target should be pushed back “by a few weeks”.The University of Cambridge academic told BBC Radio ’s Today programme there had been an “exponential growth” in the number of cases, fuelled by the more transmissible Indian iant, but that the “explosive” impact it could have was currently being masked by the high vaccination rate.Professor Gupta said: “It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a  sense of security for some time, and that’s our concern. Cabinet minister Mr Eustice said the Government wanted to monitor the data before making a final decision on whether to go ahead with its June  plans to abolish social distancing and limits on socialising.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"easyjet customers holidays ruined last","story":"NewsEasyJet customers have holidays ruined at last minute after flights to Greece cancelledCustomers of the budget airline have complained of having deals they snaffled up replaced with inconvenient alternative flights and expensive accommodation, while others have been left unsurethey can head away on holiday at all due to cancellationsmirrorShareCommentsByMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY NewseasyJet said it was cancelling majority of our flights are being cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

One man took to Twitter to complain about having his flight rebooked at a higher price.What an absolutely horrendous customer service you have, he wrote to easyJet.

It read: We want to fly as many customers on as many flights as possible this summer, however as all airlines have been doing throughout the pandemic, we continue to adjust our flying schedule based on the restrictions put in place by Governments to ensure our flying programme best matches demand.  The spokesman added that easyJet is communicating with any customers impacted by a cancelled flight in order to ensure they are aware of the options open to them, which include a full refund. We are providing customers with more flexibility than ever before with our Protection Promise which enables customers to change their flights fee-free up to two hours before their flightthey are no longer able to travel, the spokesman said. We have consistently urged the UK Government to increase the number of countries on the Green list and have kept our aircraft and crews in flight-ready mode so we have the ability to ramp up to % of our fleet by peak summer so we are ready and able to ramp up, the statement concluded.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEasyJet"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park. All the situations in the advert show the kind of fantastic projects those who play The National Lottery are helping to fund – from community sports to keeping our beaches clean and safe, bringing history to le in museums and helping people explore the great outdoors.By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week*.

The image shows Mr Baird in mid-air in a front garden as children look on from inside a house, and is among  photographs chosen for Kate’s Hold Still exhibition and book, which encouraged the public to document le during the pandemic. Mr Baird, who runs Jason Baird’s Black Belt Academy in Stockport, Greater Mancester, and his friend Andrew Baldock, became known as the “Stockport Spider-Men”, as they entertained children and family alike by dressing up as the character on their walks.  Speaking on the phone to Mr Baird, the duchess said: “Thank you for sending in your photograph because there are some really emotive and really sad images and stories that we had. “But this brought, you know, particularly to the judging , it was such a wonderful positive image of community spirit. “It was amazingly captured. “And I hadn’t appreciated at the time that you are a martial arts teacher so that gives it a lot of context as well.” Mr Baird, a father-of-two, said when he and a friend heard people were only allowed out for an hour a day they wanted to “try and cheer the kids up”. He told Kate: “It was more a case of trying to bring a few smiles and stuff.” Mr Baird said children in the area were dressing up as Spider-Man and had signs in their windows saying “Spider-Man stop outside my house”. Kate, a keen amateur photographer, said this was “very cool”, and joked that she might have to get the Duke of Cambridge the Spider-Man costume. “I’ll seeit takes on the trend here at Kensington Palace,” she said. “Unfortunately I’m not so surehe’s going to get the air clearance that you’ve got.” Kate said Mr Baird has showed “huge dedication” to his community. A recording of last autumnaposs phone call was released on Monday on the Cambridgesapos YouTube channel, the latest in a series of conversations to be released in recent weeks as part of the Hold Still initiative. Members of the public were asked to submit images which were captured during Covid lockdown. Kate and five judges selected their favourite photos from more than , submissions, whittling the list down to the top .  William and Kate last week concluded a royal tour of Scotland. During the trip, the duchess kept her promise to a little girl who wanted to meet a princess dressed in pink, her favourite colour. Kate proved true to her word when she invited little Mila Sneddon and her family to the Queen’s official Edinburgh home and wore an ME+EM outfit that matched the five-year-old’s dress. The outgoing little girl, who is battling cancer, has captured the duchess’ heart – and when they met she told the youngster she wanted to give her a “big squeezy cuddle”. Mila was featured in a picture from Kate’s Hold Still project and came to symbolise isolation during the pandemic after she was pictured kissing her home’s kitchen window as her father stood outside.The little girl is undergoing chemotherapy for leukaemia and was photographed separated from her father during the first lockdown, after he had to go to work and could not risk bringing coronavirus into the family home in Falkirk.

The Sussexes made a series of shocking statements about the royal family and le in the media spotlight during their chat with the US TV legend. Harry was reunited with his family just weeks after making the controversial claims at Prince Philipaposs funeral, where Kate was the first member of the family to be seen chatting to him. Meghan, who is heavily pregnant, wasnapost able to attend on medical advice.Writing for Stella magazine, royal expert Camilla Tominey explains: Despite the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s Oprah Winfrey interview, when Kate was accused of making Meghan cry during a bridesmaid’ s dress fitting and failing to support her, Kate rose decidedly above it all. Setting aside any personal resentment she may still feel about Harry and Meghan’s televised two-hour tell-all, Kate put her best foot forward in trying to carve a path to reconciliation between the brothers. Few would have blamed her for giving Harry the cold shoulder, yet she clearly resolved that the situation needed to be appeased rather than aggravated. Christopher Wilson told the magazine that he didnapost believe Kateaposs decision to start up a conversation with Harry, which resulted in the Duke chatting one-on-one with William as the family walked away from the St Georgeaposs Chapel service, wasnapost a planned event.  He said: I thought it was entirely spontaneous and clever in making the two brothers talk to each other. It was a deft move that shows the Duchess is not overawed by all that’s going on. Kate was always extremely close to Harry, and he once described her as the sister he never had. They attended a number of joint engagements together and joined forces to launch their mental health organisation, Heads Together. When Harry was living at Kensington Palace he spent a lot of time at the Cambridgesapos apartment, and Kate would often cook him dinner. She was reportedly always on hand to offer him advice, especially when it came to love and romance. A source told the Daily Mail: Kate has quite a dferent relationship with Harry than she has with William. Harry appeals to her sillier side because he is carefree, footloose and loves banter,apos they said. aposHe finds things funny about people and says so.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarkleKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harry poking bear royal","story":"NewsMeghan and Harry poking the bear and royal family may have a tipping pointPrince Harry has been \"poking the bear\" with the allegations hes made against the royals in interviews and his latest documentary could push them too far, an expert warnsmirrorShareCommentsByNilufer Atik:,  MAY NewsPrince Harry has dropped some shocking bombshells in recent months \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In the episode, which is part of a series of interviews with celebrities covering mental health issues, the prince also hinted that his family felt shame over his struggles with mental health. It followed on from Harry and Meghan’s explosive interview with Oprah back in March, when he claimed members of the Royal Family made racist comments about the colour of his son Archie’s skin before his birth. The Palace have always gone with the never complain, never explain approach,” The MailPlus host said.  The couple announced on January  last year that they would step back from senior positions within the family following talks at Sandringham with Prince Charles, Prince William and the Queen. They then relocated with their son Archie Harrison to Calornia, having spent the intervening period living in Canada, in the hope of a more private lestyle. But since then they have taken part in a number of public interviews which have revealed details from behind the scenes at the palace.  In their controversial March interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan revealed she had suffered from suicidal thoughts and that members of the royal family had aposconversations with Harry about how dark [Archieaposs] skin might be when heaposs bornapos. Harry has also since appeared on a podcast in which he suggested that Prince Charles handed down a cycle of genetic pain and suffering to him. Ms English said: The Palace have always gone with the never complain, never explain approach.  Can we really expect that to carry on  Surely there will be a tipping point  She continued: Buckingham Palace genuinely don’t want to get drawn into a public slanging match with Harry and Meghan,” said English. That said, they are poking the bear a lot, and people are right to wonder whether there will be a tipping point.  I donapost think it will be anytime soon. The royals are hoping that Harry will just burn himself out, that he says what he wants to say. Whether it is from the heart, or he wants revenge, they are just hoping that he will get it off his chest and move on.  They hoped that would happen with the first Oprah Winfrey interview, but other so-called truth-bombs have been lobbed since. She also said that the family’s methods for fighting back were limited: The Queen has already made very very clear that recollections y on a lot of what they say but she really wants to sort this out privately.In his latest appearance in The Me You Canapost See: The Path Forward, Prince Harry told Oprah families can feel ashamed when they donapost realise what is happening with family membersapos mental health.The Mail’s Saturday Diary Editor Richard Eden questioned why Harry had to keep dragging his family into it. However, he added: It’s very good that Harry has spoken about his mental health and his therapy and that may be encouraging to other people, particularly men.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBuckingham PalaceMeghan MarklePrince HarryThe QueenOprah WinfreyRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It comes as the hospitality sector launches into recovery mode after more than a year of crippling Covid restrictions that have brought the industry to its knees. Small business owner Jamie Rogers, who is offering new staff a £, bonus each, has said pubs and restaurants will face a huge problem by winterthings donapost change. Jamie, , who runs Twenty Seven by Jamie Rogers restaurant in Kingsbridge, Devon, said: “Right now I only have  staff and need  to be fully operational. We are turning away bookings every day.  It’s impossible to find good staff and restaurants are offering double wages to bring people in.“I call on the Chancellor to end furlough now because enough is enough and we are going to be facing a huge problem by winter, he told The Sun on Sunday.Jamie said his business is losing out on thousands of pounds a day and that he would give the bonus to anyone willing to work for him until September. Furlough has helped keep unemployment at around five per cent with approximately .million people joining from the scheme at some point during the pandemic. The scheme, which supports workers by providing  per cent of their wages up to £, per month is currently in place until September.  A Treasury spokesperson said: “Furlough means two million fewer people will have lost their jobs. We went long with furlough to avoid a clf edge and ensure as many jobs as possible are protected.”It comes after the popular Hawksmoor restaurant chain said last week it would offer new workers £, bonuses in a bid to help plug staff shortages.Hawksmoor co-founder Will Beckett said the industry is “struggling” to find workers.Beckett told the BBC : Hospitality is struggling with recruitment at the moment. Itaposs a little hard to tell whether this is because there arenapost enough people due to them leaving the country or leaving the sector, or because everyone is recruiting at the same time.Workers will get a £ bonus for the first person who passes their probation period, followed by £ for the next friend, and up to £, for five friends.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPubsTreasuryFurlough"},{"url":null,"title":"stupid men who dropped sofa","story":":root Stupid men who dropped sofa from roof of building crushing woman below spared jailThe pair made the \"stupid\" move after failing to manoeuvre the furniture out of the building by other means - but the victim, who was left with a fractured spine, has said she doesnt want them to go to jailStupid men who dropped sofa from roof of building crushing woman below spared jailThe pair made the \"stupid\" move after failing to manoeuvre the furniture out of the building by other means - but the victim, who was left with a fractured spine, has said she doesnt want them to go to jailThe victim was reportedly left with a fractured spine and is now unable to sit for more than  minutesImage: cascadenewsByConor RiordanNina LloydFreelance reporter:,  May Updated:,  May Two men who dropped a sofa from the roof of a building onto a woman below leaving her with le-changing injuries have been spared jail. Barrie Law, , and Lee Morrison, , were sentenced at Aberdeen Sherf Court on Monday having previously each admitted one charge of culpable and reckless conduct. The incident on December , , saw the pair trying to remove a sofa from Lawaposs flat in Aberdeen and throw it from the top of Nailco Nail Bar. The court was told the pair had been unable to find another way to manoeuvre it out of the building and settled on chucking it from the roof. They had checked to seeanyone was in the area below before dropping it from a height of five metres after believing the coast was clear. But the furniture struck beautician Edita Butkeveiciute, , who was outside at the time on a lunch break. When Law made the horric discovery that she had been crushed, he initially thought she was dead, the court heard today. The nail-worker suffered a fractured spine and has since said the pair made a stupid mistake - but added she did not want them to sit in jail. The charge states the impact has caused her severe injury, permanent disfigurement and impairment. Fiscal depute Colin Neilson said: She wasnapost aware of what happened, she woke up screaming. It was heard she is still unable to sit for more than  minutes, suffers panic attacks near tall buildings, flashbacks and has had her ability to sleep affected. George Mathers, representing Law, said the incident would haunt his client for the rest of his le and he was extremely sorry for his conduct.  He said: When they saw the woman, he got absolutely the shock of his le. He thought she was dead, he was shaken to the core. He feels so guilt-ridden about what he has done. Debbie Ginniver, representing Morrison, said: Mr Morrison certainly didnapost intend for anyone to get hurt, however, the complainer did suffer very serious injuries for his actions and he feels dreadful for that. It was a catastrophic error of judgment on Mr Morrisonaposs part. If Mr Morrison couldback to December , , he wouldnapost make the same mistake. Sherf William Summers said: Shewas in hospital for a number of weeks and is still recovering.  Her injuries are le changing. He added: Had it been the case that the two of you had simply dropped this sofa without taking any precautions, custody would be inevitable. But I accept you took precautions, albeit entirely inadequate. To put it simply, itaposs hard to imagine doing anything more culpable and reckless than dropping a sofa from a roof. Law was ordered to pay £, in compensation and carry out  hours of unpaid work over  months.

The petition was launched by royal expert Lady Colin Campbell, author of Meghan and Harry: The Real Story.She told the Daily Star that Harry should request that the Queen put his titles into abeyance, meaning they would go into a state of temporary disuse or suspension.She said: I started it because I think it’s the right thing to do.  I have spoken to people, many people, who think it’s the right thing to do and it is the solution. It is a dignied solution for all concerned. To humiliate no-one and protect everyone. I think it’s a humane way of solving a very regrettable situation.The royal expert believes Harry and we Meghan Markle would still be able to sell their brand without the royal titles.Lady C said: It is the best solution because it frees Harry to be able to indulge himself without consequence and without doing damage to the institution of the monarchy of the British nation, the British people and himself. So from that point of view it frees him and he is big enough that he doesn’t need the royal title, he’s gone beyond that, he doesn’t need them, they are shackles that he could well do without. He doesn’t need them - he is too big for them now.  Her petition states: The purpose is to invite Prince Harry to voluntarily ask The Queen to put his royal style, titles and rank into abeyance, thereby freeing him from the diplomatic, political and constitutional constraints that are an inevitable part of royal rank, and further freeing him from the constitutional conflicts which his beliefs are creating, with all their implications at home and abroad, in particular in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, where his articulated beliefs are in open conflict with the accepted tenets of both the United Kingdom and American Constitutions. As a purely private citizen, with no royal rank, style or title, he will be able to indulge his personal beliefs, as is the right of all private citizens, without the consequential possibility of damaging the institution of the Monarchy or relations between Friendly Powers, and will be free to articulate beliefs, no matter how objectionable, without the fallout that is otherwise inevitable as long as he possesses royal status. His invitation to The Sovereign, being of his own accord, will resolve conflicts that would otherwise be inevitable, and will permit him to enjoy the credit of having put both national and international interests above his own, personal ones, in the process gaining him respect that he otherwise will not enjoy.The petition is available to sign on Change.org here.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarkleThe QueenLady Colin CampbellPrince HarryRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"university students transform home four","story":"NewsUniversity students transform home in four months for £k with savvy DIY tricksMia, , and Jack, , completed the mammoth refurb in just four months and their home is now unrecognisable with new floorboards, pipes and even a decorative chimney breastmirrorShareCommentsByLata Yedroudj:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMia and Jack believe they pulled the impressive project off because theyre a good team \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Mia Thomas, , and her partner Jack Bradley, , moved into the flat in June  and decided to renovate it into a modern space. The space is now unrecognisable after the couple toiled after classes and on the weekends painting walls, adding new fittings and even building a decorative chimney breast. Jack was able to do much of the work thanks to his skills as a part-time electrical engineer but the couple also roped in kitchen fitters for some of the fiddlier bits. They bought the property last year for £, and started doing it up in January, finishing the work by May. “We’re so pleased with what we’ve done so far,” Mia said. “We’re really proud of ourselves and how it’s all coming together. “I would say that I have the eye for design and Jack is the handyman – we’re a good team! We were both raised in DIY families and enjoyed the idea of doing up a house ourselves. “This way we would make the house the way that we want it, but also hopefully add some value for when we come to sell it.” The couple started with the kitchen, ordering new appliances from Wickes, which cost them £,.

They also painted the walls for £ and retiled for £, as well as adding new cabinets, handles and other fittings for £,. Altogether, the room was the most expensive in the house to transform with £, from the total budget going towards the kitchen. Mia said: The most enjoyable part so far has been having the kitchen of our dreams finished! “It’s such a nice space and we use it so often.” Meanwhile, in the living room, the couple ripped out the old flooring and replaced it with new imitation parquet flooring, which cost £. Next, they fitted new skirting boards from Skirting  Uand repainted the walls with a cheap tin of paint from Wickes . The couple also fitted a new toilet and vanity unit and added charming accessories including a mirror, prints and a hanging plant – which cost them just under £ in total. For the bathroom, they reinstalled the pipe work with a new shower, alongside a bespoke shelf made from wood and waterproof backer board. They also built a  chimney breast out of wood and added a plasterboard – costing £ in total – though they outsourced the latter to a professional. For their new cloakroom, the couple ripped out the flooring and walls – then did pipe work modications to turn the old cupboard into a laundry closet. The entire home transformation cost the couple around £, in total – and they couldn’t be more pleased. Mia offered a few words of advice to others who wish to do their own home renovations.

To make matters worse, punters say they werenapost even kept in the loop about what was causing the delay after they placed orders on the popular pubaposs app. One disgruntled customer at The Imperial in Exeter, Devon, hit out at the branch for accepting payments via phone in Wetherspoonsapos interests while failing to get orders to tables on time. The punter, who wishes to remain anonymous, had headed to the pub on Sunday with his daughter while she visited him from London.Unfortunately for him, the place was heaving both inside and in the garden leaving staff overwhelmed by the demand, reports Devon Live.  It comes as pubs and restaurants across the country opened with full indoor service for the first Bank Holiday weekend since restrictions eased. His modest order of a pint of Abbot Ale, a pint of Carlsberg shandy, and a pint of lime and soda took a whopping two hours to arrive. He said: We went to The Imperial and we arrived at . in the afternoon. We didnapost have to wait long for a table in the garden.

It is absolutely ridiculous Iaposm sorry to say... What nobody told you when you arrived, is that you would have to wait an hour and a quarter to actually get a drink. And of course, the app keeps accepting orders, because nobody switches it off, which is in Wetherspoonsapos interests.Wetherspoons has now acknowledged the failures in their service on Bank Holiday weekend and made a formal apology. Eddie Gershon, a spokesperson for the chain, said: “We apologise to the customers for the issues with the app and their drinks order. “The pub was at its capacity and the bars could not keep up with the volume of drinks being ordered on the app. "},{"url":null,"title":"widowed queen 95 eager out","story":"NewsWidowed Queen, , eager to get out and about after shielding during Covid pandemicThe Queen is said to want an increased workload after mourning the loss of her husband and being confined to video-link appointments for the majority of the Covid pandemicmirrorShareCommentsByNina LloydFreelance reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe Queen is set to meet with President Biden and other world leaders as restrictions ease \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

If I bought a multipack of cakes, I would eat all five andI bought a meal that would feed four, I would eat the whole thing. Kelly said her weight used to make her self-conscious about even being seen in swimwear, but her strict regimen has given her the confidence to take on new challenges. As well the half-marathons sheaposs done a few ks and plenty of parkruns - the first of which left her in complete pain and took an hour to complete.Do you have a similarly inspiring weight loss story  Contact us on webnews@mirror She said: I went to Malta on holiday and had an allergic reaction to sun cream so the pharmacist told me to stay covered up and I was really glad because it was an excuse to wear a top around the pool. I feel a lot more confident now. I feel like a dferent person. I didnapost actually know how big I was at the time because I avoided it. I had a lack of grip on reality in terms of how overweight I was. There was a turning point when my friend invited me to do a k parkrun and it took me over an hour, I was out of breath and I had to take my shoes off because I had a massive blister.  Kelly initially didnapost believe fitness experts who told her she would rapidly shed weightshe followed their advice. But she has now shared details of her diets before and after the lestyle change and confirmed the move made a massive dference. Someone had taken a photo of me and I felt so rubbish. I couldnapost believe it was me, she said. I joined a boot camp where they saidI calorie counted and followed their advice Iaposd lose a stone per month.  I didnapost believe them but after the first month Iaposd lost over a stone. Iaposve had a real lestyle change. Iaposve been overweight since secondary school.

Sophie Hartman, , even reportedly subjected her adopted daughter to unnecessary surgery and forced her to attend over  medical appointments when there was nothing wrong with the youngster. She claimed the little girl, whom she adopted from Africa, suffered from a rare neurological disease called Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, but doctors say the child is perfectly healthy. Hartman is now facing charges of medical child abuse, after a y investigation was launched into her behaviour. Court documents state that she first began taking her daughter to appointments from the age of two and subjected her to what doctors referred to as an aposunnecessary medical procedureapos, by having them put a surgically implanted feeding tube into the youngster. The six-year-old, who lives with her mother in Renton, Washington, was also made to use a wheelchair and wear leg braces, even though doctors insisted that they were not necessary, Q FOX reports. It was finally revealed that the little girl was not sick after she was removed from her adopted mother’s care and place under observation at Seattle Childrenaposs Hospital, where doctors could find no evidence of a neurological disorder.  Specialists at the hospital requested the consultation after becoming concerned that Hartman was asking for aposincreasingly invasive procedures based upon undocumented signs and symptoms reported by the parentapos, according to the court documents. But the court papers state that there were no findings or reported symptoms to support any of her prior diagnoses at any point during the child’s admission. Reports also note concern that aposthis pattern has resulted in unnecessary medical testing, medication, procedures, surgeries and debility of this child.apos  Search warrants did reveal that the girl was diagnosed with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, but medical providers said this was based on information about her symptoms provided to them by Hartman. None of these symptoms, which include paralysis, limb weakness and severe seizures, had actually been observed by anyone other than Hartman, the documents allege. The investigation also revealed entries in Hartmanaposs diary, which suggested she had a history of lying about having certain medical conditions, such as meningitis.  In one concerning entry, she wrote: aposWhen it comes to suffering, I am a compulsive liar exaggerator.apos Hartman also set up ious fundraisers for her daughter and her alleged disorder and social media pages. She was granted a wish by the Make-A-Wish Foundation and posted a video about her daughter’s alleged ill-health, saying she had been diagnosed with a disease that meant “at any given time, she can go paralysed”. “Doctors, even the best pediatric specialists, do not know what to do and do not have treatment options… She needs access to oxygen because her breathing shallows and slows she depends on her feeding tube when sheaposs unable to eat,” she stated in the recording.  A statement issued by Hartmanaposs attorneys on her behalf, which was seen by Q FOX, claims that the mother is aposinnocent of these charges.apos It adds: aposContrary to the allegations of the King County Prosecuting Attorney, the childaposs diagnosis was made by more than one doctor, is legitimate, and is based on a substantial record beyond the reports and information provided by Ms. Hartman. aposThat record includes independent medical examinations by multiple doctors, direct observation of the child by doctors and nurses at Duke and at Seattle Childrenaposs Hospital, standardised testing results, videotapes of the childaposs symptoms, MRI, EEG and other diagnostic tests.aposFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnMake A Wish FoundationHospitalsAdoption"},{"url":null,"title":"cafe adds 350 fee customers","story":"NewsCafe adds £. fee for customers wearing face mask or bragging about having jabThe eaterys owner previously claimed any visitors who threw their mask in the bin would be given  per cent off their order - and now a neighbouring business is getting the blamemirrorShareCommentsByNina LloydFreelance reporter:,  MAY NewsThe cafes Yelp page was temporarily disabled to stop people posting feedback about the sign \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Fiddlehead’s Cafe in Mendocino pinned a sign to the shop window earlier this week outlining the bizarre new service rules. It reads: “ FEE ADDED TO ORDERS PLACED WHILE WEARING A FACE MASK and adds in small-print there will be an additional fee boasting about vaccination status. Owner Chris Castleman, , has said he objects to mask-wearing mandates because people should be given the freedom to decide for themselves how they handle the pandemic. He previously announced in April that customers who throw their mask in the trash would be given  per cent off their order. Castleman claims that the fees will be donated to a domestic abuse charity, telling local media outlet SFGate: I’ve been told this whole time that wearing a mask is a small price to pay. Some people get shocked by the sign but to see them turn around and get disgusted... when they’re asked to pay  [for charity], it’s not in their wheelhouse. It’s not something they’re choosing to do. The cafeaposs business page was temporarily disabled on Yelp by Thursday to block reviews being posted about the sign. But neighbouring restaurant Mendocino Cafe, which in contrast asks customers to wear masks to protect against Covid, has now been taking the blame instead, according to its owner Meredith Smith. What’s happening is that we’re on the same corner,” Smith said. “I get a lot of feedback directed at him. They think I’m him, we’re across the street from one another.” Smith says Castleman did not engage with her when she approached him about the issue previously and she has since given up. Castleman has said the sign will be kept up for at least a couple of months. Mendocino County is currently in Calorniaaposs yellow reopening tier, which allows hospitality venues to operate with indoor service at  per cent capacity. As of May , more than , vaccine doses have been administered across the county, according to Calornia All.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeredith SmithDomestic violenceCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"bat forces plane emergency landing","story":"NewsFlying bat inside plane at ,ft forces jet into emergency landingAn Air India flight was forced into an emergency landing after a fruit bat was spotted flying around a plane over the heads of stunned passengersmirrorShareCommentsByAdam BarnettSarah Lumley:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video passengers-flight-left-alarmed-after-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:SlnGOUot,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Footage of the bizarre incident shows the bat soaring through the aircraft on Thursday last week. The Air India flight from Delhi, India, to Newark, US, took off at .am. The bat was spotted on the Boeing  passenger jet a mere  minutes into the -hour flight. Passengers twisted and turned to keep an eye on the bat as it flew in circles around the cabin. The flight captain informed Air Traffic Control of their extra passenger. The plane was advised to turn around and make an emergency landing.  The aircraft was forced to dump ,worth of fuel before ing to Indira Gandhi International Airport. It landed safely and stunned passengers found themselves back on the ground in the Indian capital city at .am. Wildle experts boarded the plane to retrieve the bat - but it was found dead, in the Business Class section. The bat’s leless body was removed and the plane was fumigated. A spokesperson for the Directorate General of Civil Aviation in India said: The bat was found dead in the plane. This is believed to be the first time a live bat has been found on an Air India flight.  The airline has asked for a detailed report from the engineering team of the B-ER aircraft. An Air India official said the bat could have snuck onto the plane from a catering vehicle. They said: Mammals such as this one have the possibility of coming from third party vehicles, like catering vehicles.

The announcement comes after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the worldaposs most populous country. The policy change will come with supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our countryaposs population structure, fulfilling the countryaposs strategy of actively coping with an ageing population, the official Xinhua news agency said following a politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping. Among those measures, China will lower educational costs for families, step up tax and housing support, guarantee the legal interests of working women and clamp down on sky-high dowries, it said. It would also look to educate young people on marriage and love. Beijing scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in , replacing it with a two-child limit to try and stave off risks to its economy from a rapidly ageing population. But that failed to result in a sustained surge in births given the high cost of raising children in Chinese cities, a challenge that persists to this day. China had a fertility rate of just . children per woman in , recent data showed, on par with ageing societies like Japan and Italy and far short of the roughly . needed for replacement level.  People are held back not by the two-children limit, but by the incredibly high costs of raising children in todayaposs China. Housing, extracurricular activities, food, trips, and everything  add up quickly, Yei Li, a sociologist at NYU Shanghai, told Reuters. Raising the limit itself is unlikely to tilt anyoneaposs calculus in a meaningful way, in my view.  Early this month, a once-in-a-decade census showed that the population grew at its slowest rate during the last decade since the s, to . billion, fueling concerns that China would grow old before it gets wealthy as well as criticism that it had waited too long to address declining births. This is without a doubt a step in the right direction, but still itaposs a bit timid, Shuang Ding, chief economist at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong said. A fully liberalised birth policy should have been implemented at least five years ago, but itaposs too late now, although its better late than never, he said.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnParentingChina"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/03/shutterstock_1866221560-e1616262386185-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority.

It is a very unusual year with finances because you’re getting monies from areas you’ve never had from before.“Everything changed but I don’t think we will have a massive loss like we have in years past.“Because of the help of everyone around the club we’re on relatively good footing going forward.“We had to make serious, hard decisions.“Even with players taking wage cuts and staff as well we weren’t going to defer that and make it next year’s problem.“It was brave of people to accept that and see the bigger picture.“For that, we are in a strong position going into next year, financially.”A major part of that has been the insurance policy that guarded against the events of spring  and the loss of earnings incurred.A protracted legal wrangle brought doubt over whether the insurance broker would pay out.However, success came in the courts for the club and money has slowly been trickling into the Dens Park coffers. | Dundee Promotion Joy As Kilmarnock are Relegated | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed A_hgapJNaw start#featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenCombined with things like the Government’s furlough scheme and philanthropist James Anderson’s donation to the SPFL, things have been somewhat eased financially through the toughest of years.Nelms said: “The insurance policy has been fantastic for us.“It is like pulling teeth but they are paying out.“They are about four months behind so it takes time to get that money out.“It’s been a hurdle to get over but it is definitely a leline.“You can knock the Government but the furlough scheme and the dferent incentives that you could apply for, the gentleman who came up with the money with every team in our league getting £, # all of these things added up to where it took the pressure off.“It did bring other pressure, such as arguing with insurance companies, which is something you would only do once in a while rather than monthly or weekly.“You had a dferent set of issues but, overall with that, the way the fans have stepped up, Dee Promotions changing the way they done things, Dee TV and restructuring everything we did along with the insurance money, kept it ticking over.“We were still nervous about it and although we were never comfortable it was ticking over.“As an organisation, we feel we are in a good position.“Hopefully we can stop worrying about some of the restrictions and they start going away.“We can then start focusing on getting the fans back in.”The playing squad accepted wage cuts, as did staff around the club, while Dundee fans Ross Day and Scott Roberts set up the  Foundation, which has seen supporters donate £, to the club over the past season.Around  Dees have signed up to the venture, which sees all money raised funnelled into the Dens Park coffers.• Virtual ticket raised just under k• Now over  members • Over £, a month donated to @DundeeFC from the fans• On course to top £, in their first yearJoin here 👇🏻https:t.co yTAtevSEbmdash The Dee ArchiveMay , Also helping out was local businessman John Bennett, owner of Dens Park.

so it was quite a natural extension.”The sport is one of the fastest-growing worldwide and is usually played in doubles.The court is about one third of the size of a conventional tennis court.Players can use the walls of the enclosed court during play, while the rest of the rules are similar to tennis.Mr McKinnell said: “Padel tennis is one of the world’s fastest growing sports.“It is played predominantly outside on a court that is a cross between a tennis and squash court.#They are about one third of the size of a traditional tennis court and you are allowed to use the back wall.“It is more inclusive for younger people, and for older people.”The sales and operations manager also hopes that the sport’s rise in popularity will continue as people look to get fit after the Covid- pandemic.The -year-old said: “It’s quite a social sport.#As people are starting to get back out from lockdown, they can feel more comfortable with other people.“It’s suitable for all ages and it’s less running – you#re always playing on astro turf so you’ve got a good stable base beneath you as well.”There has been “soaring demand” recently, Mr McKinnell said.That includes interest from a number of unnamed sports stars across the UK who are following in the footsteps of Barcelona legend Messi.He added: “I’m not able to give names but there are a few going up around the UK  for sportspeople.”The sales and operations manager hopes  will be their breakout year.#Hopefully that’s just the start of the market growing.“There is quite a big interest at the minute.”The business has just under  staff across two sites in the UK.It also installs high-security fencing at theme parks, airports and zoos across the country.It also specialises in motorway acoustic barriers, car park barriers and security solutions, sports lighting and gates.That is also thriving. “We’ve got several large installation contracts ongoing.

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

This decision, however, was to prove costly for the senior pair of Ian Guy and Neil Ward who, having had their younger opponents on toast for most of the game, crumbled like one of Mary Berry’s cakes in the final two ends to hand victory to Alan Guy and Craig Bruce -.The senior heavyweight battles continued, with Michael Heafey and Colin MacInnes slugging it out with Archie MacVicar and Donald Crawford.Despite some hefty blows being landed by each pair they could not be separated, and peels prevailed at -, though MacVicar looked the freshest after this -rounder.Rink one was not quite living up to its billing. To use a golfing term there were quite a lot of #shanks# about, with Scott #Lefty# Gargan and Fiona McLeod locked in battle with their mates John Kennedy and Dorothy Clark, who had a vice-like grip on the match, whipping ahead -.In the league cross-over game, dark horses Mark Harkness and Richard Dewar were put to the sword by the evergreen Sandy Crawford and young Murray MacDonald.Neither of the two to-guns were wearing a mask on the green, but they ought to have as they robbed the dark horses at the last post to ride into the sunset with victory by an - margin.The week#s star pair were undoubtedly Anne Moore and Libby McGuinness, who were in cruise control for most of their match against Roddy MacDonald and Jamie MacLean.The Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly of this whacky race left only scorched tyre tracks as they sped to an impressive - victory, despite Libby#s concern that the Arkansas Chuggabugs had a secret weapon, to pull out six shots in the last end.As the next round approaches, Guy and Ward willto the gym the undertaker will need to resurrect his form, the postman will need to deliver and the tea table out at Lingerton will be ided, with some cups tasting just that bit sweeter.With the Portavadie Cup, for the seasons most consistent player, well underway, a few players have posted notable wins with Liz Long notching her first three pointer and Colin #Last Bowl# MacInnes remaining unbeaten."},{"url":null,"title":"cash jump for youth football","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"summer in the garden roses and relaxing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The carvings are located inside the cairn on the capstone of an Early Bronze Age burial cist.Kilmartin Glen has one of the most important concentrations of Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in Scotland, including some of the finest cup and ring markings in the country.Dr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator for Scotland’s Rock Art Project at Historic Environment Scotland , said: #It was previously thought that prehistoric animal carvings of this date didn’t exist in Scotland, although they are known in parts of Europe, so it is very exciting that they have now been discovered here for the first time in the historic Kilmartin Glen.#This extremely rare discovery completely changes the assumption that prehistoric rock art in Britain was mainly geometric and non-figurative.#While there are a few prehistoric carvings of deer in the UK, the only other ones created in the Early Bronze Age are very schematic. It is remarkable that these carvings in Dunchraigaig Cairn show such great anatomical detail and there is no doubt about which animal species they represent.#This also tells us that the local communities were carving animals as well as cup and ring mots which is in keeping with what we know of other Neolithic and Bronze Age societies, particularly in Scandinavia and Iberia. Until now, we did not know of any area in Britain with both types of carvings, which poses questions about the relationship between them and their signicance to the people that created them.#Following Hamish’s discovery, experts from Scotland’s Rock Art Project examined the carvings to confirm their authenticity. This included utilizing innovative technology in their analysis. A structured light scan was carried out by HES digital documentation experts to create an accurate and detailed D model with photographic texture, and ious visualisation techniques were then applied to the model in order to reveal more details of the carvings than would have been visible to the naked eye.Dr Barnett added: #Digital techniques are being used more and more frequently to create precise D models of rock art and reveal details that were previously unknown to us, or that we only suspected.#Digital technology is becoming increasingly important for archaeology, and particularly for rock art, and is a key to unlocking the hidden secrets of our past. This incredible discovery in Dunchraigaig Cairn makes us wonderother animal carvings previously unknown to the UK are hidden in unexpected places in our ancient landscapes, waiting to be uncovered in the future.#The cairn, which is in care of HES, is m wide and contained three stone burial chambers, or cists. The third cist, where the carvings are located, was dug directly into the ground, lined with drystone cobbled walls and capped with an unusually large stone over .m long. The remains of up to  iniduals, some cremated, were also discovered here when the site was initially excavated in the s, as well as artefacts including a whetstone, a greenstone axe and a flint kne.Hamish Fenton said: #I was passing Dunchraigaig Cairn at dusk when I noticed the burial chamber in the side of the cairn and decided to slide inside with my torch. As I shone the torch around, I noticed a pattern on the underside of the roof slab which didn’t appear to be natural markings in the rock. As I shone the light around further, I could see that I was looking at a deer stag upside down, and as I continued looking around, more animals appeared on the rock.#This was a completely amazing and unexpected find and, to me, discoveries like this are the real treasure of archaeology, helping to reshape our understanding of the past.#The cairn is currently closed while HES carries out further evaluation and puts measures in place to protect the extremely rare, and delicate, ancient carvings.Kilmartin Museum curator Dr Sharon Webb MBE said: #The archaeology of Kilmartin Glen is extraordinary, and every new discovery adds to its international importance. Future research will help us to understand how this amazing and unique art fits into the story of the Glen, which is really exciting.#We’re in the process of rebuilding the museum with £. million redevelopment and we’ll be including interpretations of this rock art in the new exhibitions when they open in .#PICS:Deer antlers can be seen carved into the rock. no_aPrehistoricCarvingsAn impresion of the rock art, by Hamish Fenton. no_aPrehistoricCarvings_HamishFentonDr Joana Valdez-Tullett, research assistant at Scotland#s Rock Ar, investigates the site at Dunchraigaig Cairn. no_aPrehistoricCarvingsDr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator at Scotland#s Rock Art Project, Historic Environment Scotland. no_aPrehistoricCarvings"},{"url":null,"title":"making it easier to get around lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"inez picks up prizes amid winning streak","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

This provided learners with the opportunity to see new words and phrases and gave fluent speakers the chance to use Gaelic outside the classroom.It was the young learners who really caught the judges# attention though, with their production, Èirich.Èirich tells the story of a social media trend that transports people into a dangerous new world, with some students caught in an infinite loop and others caught by the #person in the shadows#.Councillor Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, said: #Every year this competition attracts a huge number of high quality entries from learners across Scotland, and it is an honour that our young people made it to the final.#These talented filmmakers from Islay High School have created two exceptional productions and I#m very, very proud of them.#Gaelic has played an important role in the history of Argyll and Bute for many, many years and we#re committed to continuing to promote the language and its culture to our communities.#Gaelic education is offered in more than  of our primary schools and five secondary schools.#There has been an increase in interest in Gaelic Medium Education, which will have a positive impact on future generations of Gaelic speakers.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project. Entries must be received by midnight on June .Now, as we approach summer with hopefully fewer restrictions, we can start to make plans about how we will spend time with family and friends.Following the challenging year we have experienced, we could all do with a bit more play in our lives. Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for. Their findings were submitted to the Shark Trust.Head teacher Catriona Brown told the Courier she was #very impressed# with the children#s enthusiasm and commitment throughout the project so far.Mrs Brown hopes to be able to share in the near futureany of the children achieve the award."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"author meyrick moves into gangland territory","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

These animals are easily adaptable to a iety of habitats: from meadows to woods to city streets. They can also survive on a wide range of food, such as small mammals, invertebrates and fruit, but they will take advantage of food discarded by people.Foxes are social animals who live in small groups that consist of a breeding male , a femaleand their cubs. Usually, the male and female bond for le but there will be occasions when the male may seek additional mating opportunities.Mating takes place in winter and this is when foxes are most vocal. If you happen to have a window open on a winter night and you hear a loud screaming noise that sounds like a high-pitched screech, it is most definitely a fox looking for a mate and fending off its rivals.In spring, females give birth to several cubs, which become fully self-sufficient by autumn when they leave their parents. Some cubs may decide to stay with their family and they will play a big part in raising the following yearrsquos litter.My adventure with foxes started not that long ago. I was always fascinated by them but never really happened to photograph them. Occasionally, I was lucky to catch a glimpse of a fox but usually it was late in the evening or in a dense woodland, where photo opportunities are low.At the beginning of this year, I promised myself that I would find a family of foxes and get some decent shots. You may not believe it, but I spent weeks studying Google Maps in search of the best spots in East Lothian that I would visit everything marked green or looking like an open space was in scope for investigation.As spring progressed, I started to become more and more lucky with foxes. I reached the point when I could see them almost each time I left the house. I have taken multiple images, but I was never happy with them, until one dayhellipIt was a sunny Saturday morning when I decided to go out and look for deer. I visited a local meadow and quickly spotted a roe deer buck which I decided to follow. I did not manage to take any photos of the deer because as soon as I rushed after him, a beautully coloured fox crossed my path. Every day thenceforth I was coming back home with more information about the fox that I found. Finally, I was rewarded with some lovely shots in the setting sun! This is something I was dreaming of for so long! These animals are fantastic and I have completely fallen for them .Now, with lockdown eased, I hope you will have a chance to spend more time outdoors and hopefully see some lovely foxes. Evenyou donrsquot spot them on your walk, donrsquot give up! Look for some signs which may indicate of their presence: fox pooor their underground burrow .Scats are usually easily identiable as they are twisted and contain bits of fur and bones. They are deposited at prominent spots such as on footpaths, stumps, posts or rocks. The den is nothing  but a circular hollow in the groundyou are brave enough to lower yourself and snf it, you will smell a strong and unpleasant scent. Foxes secrete this smelly odour to mark their territories but it also helps to distinguish iniduals . They also have scent glands on their feet, so they mark their well-used trails as they walk ndash this is quite helpful to effectively navigate at night.If you would like to share your fox sightings with me or advise about good photography spots, please get in touch. I will also be delighted to chat anything wildle, so please do come up to say helloyou see me out and about with my camera.Speak to you next month!www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww.instagram zans_lenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-crematorium-near-musselburgh","story":"East Lothian Council will now consider the project from the Westerleigh Group, a developer and operator of crematoria and cemeteries, with  facilities in England, Scotland and Wales.A single-storey crematorium, of around m internally, which would house a -seat chapel, is planned in the larger of two fields on the site.There would be a waiting room, accessible toilets, administration office, crematory, covered walkway and floral tribute area.Car parking providing  spaces, including six disabled accessible bays and an additional four spaces for staff parking, and memorial gardens are also planned.George Bell, regional manager for north and east from Westerleigh Group, said: \"There is a pressing need for a crematorium in East Lothian.\"East Lothian does not have a crematorium of their own and their residents currently have to travel long journeys into Edinburgh, through busy roads, to access a crematorium.\"The area already has a large population base and this is going to grow further in the coming years, with some signicant new housing developments being planned.\"If our planning application is successful, this new crematorium will also serve the wider Edinburgh City region.\"We pride ourselves on creating and maintaining crematoria which are welcoming, attractive places for remembrance and reflection, and which are true assets to their local communities.\"The teams at all our crematoria have proudly earned a reputation for providing exceptional care and support to local people, enabling families to remember, mourn and celebrate the lives of their loved ones in a way that is uniquely personal, and we look forward to hopefully being able to bring that same high level of service to the people of East Lothian.\"Earlier this year, we conducted a public consultation exercise and were delighted to receive a positive response.\"The full planning application has now been submitted and we hope to receive a decision in early autumn.\"The site of the proposed development is around  acres, located north of the village of Old Craighall.

Naw, no way ever, sorry aunty, your walks on this trip have been long enough!And so they set off for Rannoch Moor, which meant adrive along the old road, back through the ancient Caledonian pinewood to Bridge of Orchy.As Izzy approached the bridge, her stomach sank as she relived the events of an hour ago.When Mary had made her first desperate cry to Finn, he had thankfully just closed his door so hadnrsquot heard but Izzy had. Shersquod had no choice but to rapidly set off with music playing loudly. The heartbreaking image of Mary in her rear view mirror, begging her to stop, was something she would never forget. It made her feel sick with guilt.Izzy was now desperate to speak to Ewen, to find out why the hell his mother was there in the first place after shersquod been so clear she couldnrsquot cope with being involved. And leaving the scarf, that wasnrsquot part of the plan either.Doubts and anxiety about the trip once again surfaced in Izzyrsquos mind. It had been so carefully planned to keep Finn safe, but now it seemed to be unravelling. The incident at Bridge of Orchy had unnerved Izzy to the extent she was no longer sure she could trust Ewen to keep to the arrangements they had painstakingly put together.The more she thought about it, the more she began to realise that ending the trip and taking Finn home would be the safest thing to do.But her mind was torn in a dilemma. She could see he was enjoying and benefitting from the adventure. As shersquod hoped, the landscape, the stories and immersion in nature had created a new emotional space for Finn. The Highlands were working their magic and Finn was slowly opening up his anxiety seemed less and he was managing his anger better. His regular calls to his mum were vital to maintain this, but there were signs that this trip, as Izzy had hoped, could be a seed for healing.And, besides, Finn had already made it clear he didnrsquot want the journey cut short. If she did so now, how could she explain her decision to him  She would have to make something up and he would feel so let down, probably assume he was to blame.As Izzy drove over the bridge, her mind swirled with indecision. She reached the junction with the main road, then hesitated. Head north to Rannoch Moor, or south and take Finn home  It was late afternoon now, with perhaps three hours of daylight left.ldquoCome on aunty, there are no cars, you can go.Izzy made her decision: she turned left and headed north.A distant view of the Caledonian wood was suddenly blocked by a dense plantation of Sitka spruce by the road. Then Loch Tulla reappeared into view, its banks littered with naturersquos debris, landed there during previous flooding by the loch.Before they began their ascent to Rannoch Moor, they passed the ruined castle at Achallader. Its tower was clearly visible in the distance, a jagged tooth standing defiantly but dwarfed by the mountains beyond.It was yet another fortress built by Black Duncan, this time on land taken from the Fletchers, so the story goes, by devious means. The conniving Campbell chief engineered a deadly confrontation between one of his servants and the head of the Fletchers. The sad result was the murder of the servant by the Fletcher, all part of Black Duncanrsquos plan. It was done in the heat of the moment, but murder it was, and Fletcher would hang for itcaught and tried. Duncan ensured he himself was witness to the incident, so he had Fletcherrsquos fate in his palm. So upon Duncanrsquos advice, the Fletchers fled, leaving the land to be acquired by the cunning Campbell chief, who promptly had a tower built by the farm to mark his possession of it.ldquoJust like a dog pees on lampposts to mark his territory, commented Finn.ldquoWhat an image, but yes! laughed Izzy. ldquoAnd it guards the edge of his Campbell estate, as well as the droversrsquo route. From here, we climb up to Rannoch Moor.The road curved as it climbed to give a spectacular view over Loch Tulla and the peaks of the great wall of Rannoch, a mountain boundary on the south of the moor. Izzy had travelled this way many times, but her anticipation was undiminished: Rannoch Moor is a wild place seeped in legend and history, not a few ghosts, and an unpredictable temper.Izzy pulled up at a layby on the edge of the moor and turned to look at her nephew.ldquoWersquore going on a walk, arenrsquot we  he said despondently. He looked around. It was all empty moorland with distant mountains. ldquoWe are in the middle of nowhere, aunty, what are we going to see ldquoI will be honest, Finn, itrsquos not far but it may be boggy and wet underfoot. But itrsquos a place of special meaning for me and I really want to share it with you.He looked down at his boots, then gave her an affirmative smile.ldquoOK then, I suppose so far I havenrsquot regretted going on your lsquoshortrsquo walkshellip much!They set off onto the moor but kept not far from the road. They leapt between mounds of wispy grass and bog myrtle, trying with limited success to avoid boggy areas. Soon Finn could see what he guessed was their destination: a large boulder with a tree growing from the top of it.It was a lsquogiantrsquos stonersquo but not as large as Samsonrsquos Putting Stone. Izzy climbed to the top with an ease that suggested shersquod done it before and gave Finn a hand up. They both sat under the branches of the tree, a small weather-beaten rowan, looking out to the mountains which they had passed on their journey. Cars whizzed by on the nearby road, but soon Finn became unaware of their fleeting presence as he listened to his auntrsquos words.ldquoHow it seeded in this unlikely place, I canrsquot say, she said. ldquoPerhaps a careless bird dropped a berry and couldnrsquot retrieve it. But however the seed arrived, it sprouted and grew from this small crack on the boulderrsquos summit. This tree survives on meagre ground and in an exposed position, howling winds have bent its spines. Irsquove seen it in all seasons, resplendent with berries in autumn, battered by freezing winter gales, its naked branches turned white by frost, wearing a coat of blossom in spring. Its le here seems impossible, yet it survives. Each time I pass on tour, I slow my coach and say hello under my breath. But when I am on a personal journey, I often stop and keep it company for a while.ldquoKeep it company aunty, really ldquoItrsquos alone, Finn. Trees connect with each other just as humans do, although in dferent ways of course. They crave the company of their kind, their roots intertwine as we might give each other hugs. But this beautul tree is lonesome.ldquoI donrsquot think trees get lonely, aunty, they donrsquot have feelings like we do.Izzy bent her knees up to her chin and wrapped her arms around her legs, staying silent in thought for a moment before replying.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, Finn, perhaps itrsquos that trees can help us recognise our own feelings. You know, when we see their struggles, they remind us of our own. They are living things too and I think they can understand.Finn peered up at the tree. A few red berries hung from its wilted branches. From a distance, it had looked defiant, but close up it looked, well, precarious perhaps even anxious, clinging onto its almost bare rock for survival. He didnrsquot want to admit it out loud, but he did understand what his aunt was saying he too could feel a connection to the rowanrsquos struggle.As they sat either side of the tree squeezed on top of the boulder, Izzy told a story. Finn wasnrsquot sureit was for him or the tree probably both, he reckoned. It was a story he would long remember, more deeply than he could have imagined he would.They walked back to the car silently, carefully re-treading their steps to avoid sinking ankle deep in bog. Midges buzzed in the air but didnrsquot bother. It was getting very cool and breezy darkening clouds were making the sky seem angry.ldquoThe mood of the moor is changing, reflected Izzy out loud. ldquoYou ready to see what lies beyond that ridge Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, , , , ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-added-location-mobile-coronavirus-testing-units-east-lothian-next-week-revealed","story":"The units offer Covid- tests to those who have no symptoms of the virus.As nearly one in three people who have Covid- donrsquot show any of the usual symptoms, itrsquos possible for people to be passing the virus on to loved ones and people in the community.By getting tested ndash evensomeone feels fine and has received vaccination ndash they can find outthey are positive and take immediate action to stop the spread of the virus to others by self-isolating.A fixed testing centre, located at the former Stoneyhill Community Centre in Musselburgh, continues to operate from Tuesdays to Saturdays from am to pm.

In one hand I carried the krugerrands, in the other some silver troyans, both in supermarket plastic bags. The city then was notorious for theft, muggings or worse, and had several no-go areas. It has since deteriorated, most legal businesses having left the CBD years ago for the soulless, security-saturated suburbs.That afternoon, I walked in off the street through the open door, no guard or CCTV camera in sight, and dumped the bags on the counter. The young Afrikaner casually looked inside the bags, then began to talk about Swaziland and politics. When I reminded him I wanted to sell the metals, he continued talking while scribbling on a piece of paper with the calculations then checked on a cheap hand calculator. After we agreed with his calculations, he rummaged in a locked box under the counter and produced bundles of banknotes and a tiny receipt.There was also an emotional connection to the krugers. My brother Ken was a physicist in Australia with a research interest in the heat problems posed by mining at deep levels. He was brought across to the Witwatersrand gold reef where Carletonville is one of the deepest mines in the world. The rock temperatures are so high that the miners can only tolerate about  minutes at the face, despite ice-cold water and air being pumped down to protect them. Buying some pieces of fine gold would keep their jobs going, I rationalised.In the current dficult times, copper is not peoplersquos favourite metal. The usual cause of our clinic laptops failing to start is the previous nightrsquos theft of copper wire from internet cabling. Occasionally a partly-cooked felon is brought in to casualty, having misread the wiring.Tin is used by several skilled craftsmen here but the most impressive example witnessed was when exploring the old harbour in Mombasa in Kenya. We were listening to a bearded and venerable man from Oman who traded in perfumes and scents brought across from Arabia once a year in a large dhow, ing home once the trade winds reversed. A tapping sound from nearby never stopped during his explanation of the ingredients and manufacture of his wares which he would dab on our hands, arms or necks from time to time.Eventually he led us next door and there, in the gloom, was the source of the sounds. Two men using small hammers were beating out very ornate traditional Arab coffee pots. Beneath the pot there was a space in the base for charcoal to warm the brew while a spoon-like creation for sugar was attached to its handle. These were not tourist baubles but portable workhorses and the one bought that day continues to be a source of pleasurable smells and tastes.A diamond is not, of course, a metal but is mentioned here as it arouses similar security concerns to pure gold. Dvokolwako is a diamond mine, not very far from the sugar estate in Swaziland where I worked. Our senior male nurse at the clinic, Musa Magagula, was being pestered by a relative to buy a diamond from the diggings. The three of us met one evening in the consulting room and several small shining stones appeared from a small pochette.ldquoIf itrsquos genuine, it will score a line on glass, I offered.Musa immediately took one and made for the nearest window. Not a mark. Then he swallowed the alleged precious stone and laughed at our consternation.ldquoThis is a better test. If this was a real diamond, my cousin would already be running to the police.And that was the last we heard or saw of the cousin.Dr David Vost studied medicine at Glasgow University and works at a hospital in Swaziland.

Responding to an initial written question, a Minister would read out a turgid civil service response, then subside gratefully, hoping for a y supplementary to catch his breath.Up from the Labour side would bound Tam, to declare in his sonorous Etonian tones: ldquoHow much  Or, even better: ldquoWhy  Cue startled Minister.I thought of Tam when I pondered the question of a putative co-operation deal between the SNP Scottish Government and the Greens. Recalling my journalistic coaching, I asked: ldquoWho, what, when, where, why :Now Swinney has moved on, how will we sort out Scotlandrsquos struggling schools We know who: two parties, of dferent stature, supporting independence with ying degrees of fervour.We know what: a co-operation agreement short of full coalition. Eventually, there might be Green Ministers. For now, too soon.More to the point, the Greens stress they would reserve the right to dissent on certain specied issues. Which means no collective governmental responsibility. Which means no Ministers, for now.When  The talks are said to be at an early stage with months of discussion to come. Where  Holyrood.The big question, though, is why. One observer tells me that the Green co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, seemed faintly taken aback at the initial ldquotalks about talks. Warily and sensibly, they stressed the need to consult colleagues.However, they have agreed to continue negotiating, noting en passant that they have secured concessions in recent Budget deals.There is history here. In , Alex Salmond led a minority administration. He tried to strike a partnership deal with the Liberal Democrats. That fell apart: key LibDems found the SNP and independence fundamentally unpalatable.Mr Salmond then turned to the Green MSPs. All two of them. The leader Robin Harper, with his permanent smile and Dr Who scarf. And Patrick Harvie, an astute politician even then.Again, a full partnership proved impossible, owing to a dispute over transport policy among other issues. A compact was signed to support the election of Mr Salmond as First Minister.That was not really needed: subsequent history proved that the party with the most MSPs would, in practice, be permitted by Parliament to enter office.They said they had been sold short. Mr Swinney was, to put it mildly, less than pleased. That memory no doubt lingers in the mind of the Deputy First Minister as he contemplates the new round of talks.So, again, why  Especially now, when the SNP are just one short of an overall majority in Holyrood.I sought answers from my Herald Podcast  among the number, Kezia Dugdale, who formerly led Labour and now heads the John Smith Centre. She disclosed that she had conducted extensive research, including a phone call to a pal in New Zealand, where there has been cross-party co-operation.She was advised that the Greens there felt they gained clout and influence. Labour leaders felt they gained extra security, including a pact which obviated the need for tense annual Budget talks.:Is independence inevitable or can unionists rescue the realm they cherish The deal has persisted, even though Labour won a majority last year. Some Greens are discontented.Scottish Green sources point to the New Zealand model, stressing the capacity to criticise the administration. They are less enthusiastic about the example of Ireland where some Greens fear their ideology risks being swamped in a compact with centre-right parties.Either way, it is, partly, about money. Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes want to pre-empt the annual agony of Budgetary negotiations by securing potential support in advance.Not an easy sell. SNP Ministers are adamant they will stick to an income tax freeze for the duration of this Parliament. Greens favour a more radical approach to revenue, as they would see it, including a possible wealth taxa way could be found.But compromise could be reached. There will be other obstacles, such as Green opposition to road building. The FM said this week that dualling the A, for example, will not be halted.Then there is the North Sea. The parties dfer over the pace of shting away from oil and gas. With the COP  UN climate conference due in Glasgow, the SNP may be ready to give yet more ground, while protecting north-east jobs.Always, of course, there is independence. Would a compact add more impetus to the case for indyref  Not, I suspect, in terms of influencing the UK Government. But it would perhaps be a reminder of the ersity of support for independence.There is, however, a third motivation, beyond cash and indyref. The SNP have been in power for  years. The previous Holyrood session had a toxic tang: Brexit independence arguments and Nicola Sturgeon gazing fretfully over her shoulder at her ever-present predecessor.I believe the FM wants a fresh approach. Literally, a new politics. Sceptics will say this is purely about presentation. I think it is also strategic. By making a choice, by making a new alliance, Ms Sturgeon hopes to banish staleness from her own party, and simultaneously challenge rivals to refresh.She hopes, in so doing, to isolate the Tories. They respond by warning that the Greens will push her in an anti-business direction.She hopes, also, to challenge Labour, over policy and indyref. Anas Sarwar was, understandably, ill-prepared. His first response was simply to revive an old Labour theme, deriding the recreation of a spending cuts coalition.He will need a new tone, new phrases.

Cummings was part of it too. He admitted he didnrsquot advise the PM to seriously consider lockdown until it was already too late.Cummings also saved the bacon of the hapless Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, by accusing him of repeatedly lying. Boris Johnson was forced to back his Cabinet minister, thus saving him from the chop in the forthcoming cabinet reshuffle.Cummings may also have done the PM a favour by helping expose the hypocrisy of Nicola Sturgeon. Her claims to have handled the pandemic better are now sounding distinctly hollow. She can expect a flurry of compensation claims following the admission that the Scottish Government failed to protect elderly patients in care homesIt was quite a performance. No wonder Boris Johnson practically purred at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions on the day The Dom lobbed his self-destructive hand grenades. Not so much Independence Day as the Great Escape.I felt almost sorry for the dark lord as he exposed his personality disorders in what almost became an Oprah-style confessional. Cummingsrsquos most revealing moment came right at the start when he nearly broke down while delivering an apology to those who died needlessly. He is clearly a troubled man.But he squandered it all by a display of arrogance, ignorance, pettiness, vanity, malevolence. Of unreliability and disloyalty ndash not just to Boris Johnson, who stood by him over Barnard Castle, but to the civil servants, scientists, ministers whose trust he betrayed to no good purpose.It is fine to be a whistleblower ndash provided you know how to blow it.In more competent hands Cummingsrsquos evidence, especially about Johnsonrsquos dithering over the second lockdown last autumn, might have done real damage. But his accusations either missed their target or rebounded. Not least when Cummings declared that everyone at a senior level in government was ldquocrackers ndash including himself.The main charge against Boris Johnson has always been that the PM was reckless, uncaring and throughout the pandemic, putting the interests of the economy above human lives. That he wilfully ignored scientic advice and thought we should just ldquotake it on the chin. Cummings made clear that, on the contrary, Johnsonrsquos failings were a reflection of a dysal civil service run by amateurs and by a scientic community which was fighting the wrong pandemic. It was chaos, from top to bottom. Whitehall said it had a plan but didnrsquot. The Governmentrsquos scientic advisers thought they were dealing with flu. No-one ndash Cummings included ndash advised the PM to take any serious action, such as quarantine and closing the borders, until mid-March. Even then the borders were not closed for fear it would look ldquoracist. Large gatherings like Cheltenham were allowed to continue.In hindsight, Johnsonrsquos scientic advisers should have learned from the prompt action taken by some Asian countries like South Korea that had experienced the Sars and Mers outbreaks. But the point was: they didnrsquot. Cummings underlined that international agencies ndash like the World Health Organisation and the US Centres for Disease Control ndash were also slow off the mark.Even after the pandemic was recognised as such in March , the consensus on the Scientic Advisory Group on Emergenciesand in Whitehall was that, in the absence of a vaccine, the disease had to be allowed to ldquowork its way through the population until herd immunity was achieved. The aim, as Cummings explained it, was to seek immunity by the autumn, to avoid a second wave in winter.This was all wrong, of course. Coronavirus was much more contagious and lethal than flu. But Cummings portrayed this as a collective failure that could not solely be laid at the door of the PM however ldquounfit he thought he was was for office. He even quoted the Cabinet Secretary at the time, Mark Sedwill, advocating a Covid version of ldquochickenpox parties to help spread immunity.Cummings should have pleaded the Fth because he then incriminated himself. In January and February , he did nothing. He didnrsquot even attend Cobra meetings, didnrsquot advise lockdown, didnrsquot even discuss what lockdown meant seriously until that infamous ldquoIndependence Day meeting on March  in Downing Street. That was when his whiteboard told him disaster was imminent and that the PM needed a ldquoPlan B. Unfortunately, the then-Deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen McNamara burst in saying ldquotherersquos no planndash wersquore absolutely f****d.The next day, March , Cummings still did not call on the PM to impose a full Wuhan-style lockdown. He was just ldquotoo scared that I might be wrong. Anyway, he said, SAGE ldquohad not modelled any kind of lockdown because it was still labouring under the logic of herd immunity.Yetthere was no Plan B, who might be thought to be at least partly responsible for that,not the most influential adviser in government: Dominic Cummings  He had even blogged about the dangers of coronavirus pandemics before entering government.I ended up agreeing with Boris Johnson: chaos would indeed be better than putting this monomaniac in charge of anything. Cummings even said that, given his choice, he would have put a ldquodictator in charge of the pandemic.It doesnrsquot take a genius now to forecast what the official inquiry is going to say whenever it reports. There was a systemic failure to plan going back several administrations. The scientic advisers, and Whitehall, failed to appreciate just how deadly Covid- was. The Prime Ministerrsquos advisers, from Cummings down, failed to alert him until it was too late. Lessons will be learned etc.Prime ministers are not scientists, they rely on advice from civil servants, special advisers and medical experts. Cummings even distanced Johnson from the most serious scandal of all: the deaths of some , care home residents. Cummings pinned that on Matt Hancock who, he said, lied about testing elderly patients before they were decanted from acute wards.

Therersquos a Holyrood mandate for a second referendum, facing an absolute lsquoNorsquo from Westminster. In the eyes of Scotlandrsquos most renowned historian, Sir Tom Devine, the union hasnrsquot been under such strain since the Jacobite risings were crushed.In a bid to unravel where Scotland now stands, in terms of the history of the union, the Herald on Sunday sat down with Professor Devine. Over two hours of conversation, the worldrsquos leading authority on Scottish history gave what amounts to a personal lecture for Herald on Sunday readers.BIRTH PAINSldquoLetrsquos start at the beginning, Devine says, ldquoin . The treaty was a union of partnership - thatrsquos very relevant to whatrsquos happening today.However, for the first  years ldquothere was no certainty that it would prevail in terms of a stable relationship. Aside from Jacobitism, there were two big problems: increased taxation due to Englandrsquos wars with France, and the ldquoviolation of the treaty by the Patronage Act of  which interfered with the way the church was run. Both fomented early tension and ldquohostility.Of course the main threat was ldquoJacobitism, the attempt by some elements of Scottish society to reverse the revolution of  [when the Catholic Stuart king, James II, was overthrown by Protestant William of Orange] and restore the Stuart dynasty.Although the Jacobites are remembered mostly for opposition to the Hanoverian regime, there was also, says Devine, a strong degree of ldquodisaffection from the union. Both matters were the cause of four ldquovery serious risings between  and the most famous of all .:Opinion: Throughout the pandemic Boris Johnson has had to battle with himselfMONEY, MONEY, MONEYAnti-unionism was driven mostly by economics. ldquoOne of the prime arguments made by those propagandising before the union was that it would bring bounty, says Devine. Scotland was promised ldquoan economic miracle, and after famine in the s and the financial disaster of the failed Darien expedition to establish a Scottish colony in Panama the idea of union with England ldquowas a powerful argument. You may be giving up your sovereignty but yoursquore getting economic goodies.However, the economic miracle didnrsquot happen. Scotland simply ldquodidnrsquot have the capacity to take advantage of the opportunities offered by union because the country wasnrsquot yet mature enough in material terms to exploit it.Both Jacobitism, and general dissatisfaction with the union, were partly driven by ldquoa revolution of frustrated expectations. Devine says ldquothere were Jacobite banners not simply proclaiming the Stuart dynasty but saying no to the union. There were many elements in the army of Charles Edward Stuart [Bonnie Prince Charlie] at Culloden who were not only opposed to the Hanoverians but also the union.Northeast Scotland, parts of the Highlands and islands, and parts of the southwestern border were ldquounambiguously anti-union. Anti-unionism was also ldquocommonplace in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Clearly, the Act of Union wasnrsquot agreed by the Scottish people - the event took place in a ldquopre-democratic society.Taxation, English interference in the Kirk, and the failure of the economic miracle to materialise all added to the ldquoinevitable growing pains of a union between two ancient enemies. There were three parties in parliament - the Jacobite Cavaliers, the Court party representing the establishment pushing for union, and the anti-union Country party which was out of power. There was broad parliamentary consent for the economic parts of the treaty, but dissent on most other elements. Riots broke out in Edinburgh as ldquothe street sided with anti-unionists in parliament.WAR AND SECURITYFrance - Englandrsquos great rival for world domination - saw the union ldquobolstering the power of its enemy, as it closed a backdoor to England in future wars. England, meanwhile, saw union as a national security imperative, protecting its northern border. With England emboldened militarily through partnership with Scotland, the union ldquohastened the intensity of the long wars with France until Britain emerged victorious at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in .Therersquos lesson to be learned in  from the early days of union. Scotland wasnrsquot ldquoannexed by conquest like Wales and Ireland, says Devine. ldquoIt was a partnership agreement and that partnership agreement has now been lost, and lost very recently. David Cameronrsquos granting of a referendum was an example of that partnership operating - he was quick to acknowledge the right of Scots to determine their own future, unlike his successor in Downing Street today.Devine believes thata second referendum happens ldquothe core weakness for those who wish Scottish independence will be economics, the same way economics caused dficulties in the first half of the th century.Debates today about currency, trade with England and ldquowhat kind of advantages and disadvantages would flow economically from independence ldquoecho some of the issues swirling around in the late th and early th centuries.:Poll finds only one fth of English voters oppose Scottish independenceTHE RISINGSIronically, the Jacobite risings helped secure the union. With expectations disappointed over the promised economic miracle, the threat of a successful Jacobite rebellion, which would have heralded theof Catholicism, ldquodisciplined pro unionists who were fed up with the way the union was going. Those who had a tepid commitment to the union - and given the religious make-up of Scotland theyrsquod have iniably been Protestant - were forced to group together. Those who were becoming increasingly anxious that the union wasnrsquot delivering could never have sided with those trying to break the union as that would have legitimised the forces of Catholicism. If Jacobitism didnrsquot exist, the union may have been in greater danger.That split in Scotland has echoes today. In the early s, ldquoabout a third of the population was probably anti-union. Today, Devine notes, itrsquos about -. Fear over isions, he says, will play a part in any future referendum, with unionists warning that ldquosuch a bitterly ided country is no basis for building a new nationYes won.The shaky early history of the union quickly changed, though, after the risings. By the mid th century, says Devine, ldquothe union was entirely unproblematic. How did such a sundered country unite so quickly Jacobitsim was ldquorooted out to such an extent by military and legislative means that it never recovered. By the late th century ldquoitrsquos become part of history. Jacobitism became sentimentalised in songs and Walter Scott novels. ldquoThat sentimentalisation, says Devine, ldquois the clearest example that it was beaten. If it had remained dangerous that sentimentalisation wouldnrsquot have occurred.BOOM TIMEHighland culture and power was also crushed, most famously in the Clearances. The Highland warrior was coopted into the British army, becoming a fabled part of empire after Waterloo.More importantly, though, than this pacication of the Highlands and destruction of Jacobitism was money. Scotlandrsquos ldquogreat lt off began. The country started industrialising at a remarkable rate. There was also a revolution in agriculture and mass urbanisation. ldquoThe material benefits promised by union began arriving in spades, says Devine. ldquoScotland began to feel at ease in the union.Scotlandrsquos economic revolution ldquowas the fastest and most decisive in Europe. Englandrsquos industrialisation built up over time, while in Scotland therersquod been ldquohardly any change until the mid th century when the economy exploded. ldquoThere was nothing like it in Europe until forced industrialisation in the Soviet Union, Devine said.It was this growth of wealth and industry which helped settle Scotland firmly into union. ldquoIt draws the poison of disaffection, Devine says. This accommodation with union was ldquoso complete by the s that some Scottish intellectuals feared total anglicisation, Devine explains. ldquoThere was a fear that the battle for economic development had been won at the cost of Scotlandrsquos identity.But lsquoScottishnessrsquo wasnrsquot destroyed, Devine says. Therersquos no ldquovictory of Britishness over Scottishness, rather a ldquohybrid identity of Britishness and Scottishness emerges.EMPIRE BUILDINGPatriotism remained, but Scotland was ldquothe most unnationalistic country in the world. While the great empires of Europe fell apart, Scotland ldquowas congratulating itself on being part of the British empire. The nation fully embraced the business of empire and colonialism.Another historical irony was that come the mid-th century, when Scotland was so thoroughly part of empire and union, there was almost a sense of ldquosemi-independence in terms of how the country was governed. Clearly, Westminster was sovereign, says Devine, but there was a tradition in parliament that Scottish MPs decided the ldquorelevant bills for the country - theyrsquod be put before parliament and hardly ever opposed. Scotland was also governed on a daily basis by lsquoScots in Scotlandrsquo when it came to the law, religion, education, hospitals, poor laws, and prisons.ldquoEngland was prepared to be tolerant, to stand back. There was no friction between the two countries because of Englandrsquos restraint. England refused to occupy more than its share of the marital bed.Another ldquodelicious historical irony, says Devine, is that now ldquothe situation is reverse hellipyou compare the mid-th century to Boris Johnsonrsquos union today there was arguably more Scottish control of its own business, apart from issues like macro economic policy, foreign policy and making war.ldquoAnother paradox, says Devine, is that with Scotland today ldquobeholden to England because of the Barnett formula it now experiences increased interference. The classic example is Brexit. It was the reverse of the kind of government that existed between England and Scotland in the th century because it exemplies, more than anything  in the entire history of the union, England using its weight and power to force through a decision overwhelmingly opposed by Scotland.VICTORIAN VALUESUnionism in the Victorian era was ldquobenign. The state wasnrsquot interventionist, and with no security threat from Scotland, England ldquodidnrsquot really care too much about what was going on north of the border.Against this backdrop, Scotland and England began the business of empire building as a ldquojoint partnership. Devine says: ldquoThe old aphorism is true: England ruled the empire and Scotland ran it hellip the two countries were bound in that imperial project. These bonds deepened in the th centuryrsquos two world wars which ldquobound the countries together in blood.The period throughout most of the th century until the collapse of the British empire after the Second World War was the high point of union, when ideas of SNP nationalism belonged to a ldquofringe sect.The end of empire signalled that ldquoBritain was no longer great, and was followed by a ldquoseries of economic catastrophes like the crises of the s which paved the way for Margaret Thatcher, and policies which ldquoalienated Scotland.Scotlandrsquos iconic industries collapsed - coal, steel, shipbuilding. For Scotland, trade with the empire was replaced by trade with England. Devine says hersquos more skeptical than most historians about linking the end of empire to the growth of nationalism - symbolised by Winnie Ewingrsquos  Hamilton by-election win - but the events of the latter half of the th century certainly created a sense ldquoof introspection in Scotland, the sense that a more ldquoScottish centred future was needed, fuelled in part by concerns over the increasing importance, and dominance, of the economic relationship with England.SNP ASCENDANTHowever, the rise of the SNP still ldquowasnrsquot inevitable. Things changed when Tony Blairrsquos Labour administration created the Scottish parliament. The idea that rather than ldquokilling off nationalism, Labour actually built its own gallows in Scotland through devolution is ldquovery pertinent, says Devine.At the same time, identity politics was on the rise and many were growing disenchanted with globalisation. ldquoThatrsquos a very important factor stoking nationalism, says Devine. People were becoming uneasy with the power of the large state. ldquoThey wanted more control, he says. This also played into growing criticism of the EU culminating in England quitting Europe.More importantly, though, was ldquothe apparent inability of successive British governments to cure Scotlandrsquos economic problems. Another irony, however, is that while economic discontent ran alongside the growth in nationalism, once the painful transformation of the s and s was over, Scotlandrsquos economy today has emerged in better shape than itrsquos been for a long time, says Devine.Once the SNP won its  majority, the path was laid for a referendum. Devine says the fact that support for Yes hasnrsquot disintegrated is crucial. ldquoIf there was another referendum the chances of Yes winning are now much greater.TORY DISRESPECTHowever, the other crucial factor is that the Tory Party today is ldquounlike any British government since the early th century. After breaking Labourrsquos Red Wall, itrsquos almost ldquohegemonic.Therersquos been a ldquoshattering effect on many Scots who ldquodidnrsquot want to leave their friends behind in Tory dominated Englandthey went down the independence road, says Devine. With the Tories seemingly unassailable ldquothatrsquos now changed.The most important historic change of all, though, is the attitude of the Tories in government. ldquoSince the early th century therersquos been no instance of such a brazen refusal to accept Scottish opinion as Brexit. Judged in the long history of the union, this is an extraordinary volte face. The word lsquodisrespectrsquo isnrsquot strong enough.Devine added: ldquoWhatrsquos preserved the union has been good management by England - as the dominant party. It was a policy of respect and restraint by the big elephant in the bed. Scotland is now in danger of getting pushed out of bed. The future is not my period, butindependence does come then the killer of union will be more England not Scotland, because of the abandonment of that system of restraint, partnership and respect.He added: ldquoThe governing party in England is a dferent Tory party to even the Thatcher years. Itrsquos much more right-wing. Something has happened which never existed until after : the rapid growth of English nationalism. He points to polls showing a majority of Tories happy to see the union crumble to save Brexit.ldquoThe Conservative party, which was the classic defender of union throughout its existence, can no longer be trusted to preserve the union because of the growth of this Little Englandism. Many of its supporters see Scotland as an ungrateful liability as they assume theyrsquore giving privileges out of their taxes to the Scottish people.ldquoThe union is undeniably in more jeopardy than it has ever been since the end of the th century. The vice the union is caught up in threatens to crush it - on the one hand therersquos the old enemy of Scottish nationalism, on the other therersquos the new enemy of English nationalism.THE FUTURERegardless of Tory mistreatment, the independence case is far from won. Devine says the SNPrsquos ldquoAchilles Heel is its failure to make a convincing economic argument. ldquoThe majority of sensible Scots are waiting to seethe SNP has real economic plans. They need to be totally honest with the electorate. Without the economic case being made itrsquos impossible to say whether ldquothe hammer of blow of Brexit and other aspects of UK government policy would lead to a Yes win.ldquoPeople accept the first few years of a post-union Scotland could be tough, but they may be willing to give the benefit of the doubt and vote for independencetheyrsquore told clearly and honestly what the challenges may be. If the SNP was willing to do that theyrsquod gain respect, Devine says.Devine believes any violence linked to the constitution is currently ldquomost unlikely. The SNP is law-abiding. ldquoScotland isnrsquot Catalonia. However, itrsquos ldquomore dficult to predict what might happen hellip from any extreme [unionist] elementsYes won. Even then it would be ldquosmall scale hellip hooliganism not a real ldquopolitical threat.Given the changed political landscape in England, Devine worries that any future negotiations - over the shape of a second referendum or the terms of separation - ldquowouldnrsquot be benign. London would undoubtedly play hardball. Any negotiations would be pretty brutal.He adds: ldquoIf Yes had won in  negotiations would have been relatively friendly as it was in the interests of both nations. I donrsquot think the English people at the moment are in the mood for that - and the Tory supporting majority certainly arenrsquot."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-glasgow-installs-new-seating-decking-help-boost-spaces-people","story":"As part of the Spaces for All programme, introduced last year in a response helping to make the city more covid safe, these are the latest measures which have been installed in St Vincent Place.Glasgow City Council introduced a iety of changes on roads and footways across the city through the Scottish Governments Spaces for People Programme, which aimed to support public health by providing additional space for physical distancing while undertaking essential journeys or exercise during the pandemic.Read more: Covid memorial: How I Remember theme can reach out to help culture of recuperationNow a city-wide survey is under way with residents and business being asked what measures they would like to see made permanent.

I got into a discussion with a colleague about something or other when he referred to me as ldquoProtestant. Really  Was I  Was I ldquoProtestant  I realised even at the time that Protestantism is about more than religion, but I am the son of two atheists and Irsquom not religious and I never went to church. Basically, it had never occurred to me that I was Protestant and Irsquod never once referred to myself, or thought of myself, that way.:SNP in turmoil after Indy taskforce chief quits worst job ever and malcontent treasurer resignsAndyet, as far as my colleague, and others, was concerned, I was ldquoProtestant ndash something I said, or did, had given me away ndash and, whatrsquos more, my colleague was annoyed with me for not behaving like one. He found out that friends of mine had invited me to a football game and that Irsquod gone, sitting with them in the Celtic end. As far as the colleague was concerned, this was bewildering and treacherous. I told him I would happily come and sit with him for a Rangers game too. But no. The damage was done.I realise part of the problem here is that I was a naiumlve young man coming from a city where religious sectarianism pretty much didnrsquot matter to a city where it mattered a lot. But even so, it struck me at the time that you do not always know how yoursquore seen, and that you can be walking around for a long time without noticing the labels on you. Itrsquos like that game people play at parties, the one where you stick a piece of paper on your forehead and try to guess what it says: other people can read it, but you canrsquot.The sad thing is I think a similar trend has been emerging more recently in a related but dferent way. Until  or so, I would never have considered myself ldquounionist. Part of the reason for that was the SNP were nowhere politically and the constitution, although it was discussed, was not a pressing issue. Also, most of us had not been forced to take sides and werenrsquot really thinking about the labels that might be stuck to us.The referendum in  changed that and, more rapidly and violently that I would have expected, we started to attach the labels ldquounionist or ldquonationalist to each other. It applied all over Scotland and in certain places, like Glasgow, ldquounionist and ldquoprotestant were conflated. Of course, the rule is not universal ndash I have friends from a Catholic background who voted No and friends from a Protestant background who voted Yes ndash but the point is: the labels were there and there was only a choice of two: Yes or No. Choose your side  Right, thatrsquos it: yoursquore a unionist or youre a nationalist.Some of you may think all of this is a bit rich coming from me and that Irsquom part of the problem with my ldquounionist columns and certainly I think we are now prone to look at every issue through Yes and No telescopes. Take the recent meeting between Gordon Brown and Prince William for example. Yoursquore likely to make a judgement about it depending on whether yoursquore a ldquounionist or a ldquonationalist. Perhaps you see it as the latest attempt to hold back the worrying rise of the SNP perhaps you see it as royals plotting with unionists. Check the label on your forehead for the answer.The recent argument over the statue of William III in Glasgow is also interesting in this respect. The statue has been vandalised a few times and in the most recent incident the horsersquos tail was broken off. In a statement, the Orange Order said it was yet another anti-Protestant attack and that all things Protestant and Unionist were being demonised in Scotland. ldquoWith recent rhetoric by the usual political rent a quotes and the accompanying media frenzy, it said, ldquoGrand Lodge is hardly surprised that such mindless actions have happened.:Independence: Does Sturgeon have the guts to make changes in the SNP, evenit means telling her husband that itrsquos time to move on The reaction of the Order goes back a long, long way ndash which is part of the problem ndash but my worry is their binary outlook is no longer as unusual as it once was. The Orange Order see the world as unionist and non-unionist and, instead of that approach fading into the past ndash as we might expect and hope ndash there are more Scots who now see the world this way, with or without the added ision of Catholic and Protestant. In other words, evenyou reject the idea of the \"Ulsterisation\" of Scotland - and Scotland and Northern Ireland are dferent places, of course they are -the idea of a society ided into two camps is now much more familiar to Scots than it would have been  years ago.The fact that wersquove seen this happen over the last few years is utterly depressing to me. Perhaps it is a perverse comfort to some that the isions that exist in Scotland are not unique and that politics is more ided along identity lines around the world . And, in some ways, Scotland has become a more erse and more tolerant place.However, in other ways,were being honest, Scotland has become distinctly less tolerant, particularlyyou belong to the ldquoother camp and the label on your forehead says the wrong thing. And my worry is that, now we think in these terms, the labels will never disappear. As long as Scotland remains in the UK, we are all either unionist or nationalist, and evenwe do become independent, the resentments associated with the labels are unlikely to go away. Because labels stick.All we can do, I suppose, is try to resist as much as we can. In the years that Irsquove been writing this column, Irsquove been called pretty much everything: unionist, Tory, right-wing, ldquowoke, SNP hater, SNP spy, and someone even speculated about whether I used to be a member of the Socialist Workersrsquo Party . The point is some of the labels are laughable and some are just wrong but none of them is entirely accurate because simplistic labels rarely reflect the details of who we are and what we think. I do not want to be a label. I do not want to be this or that. I do not want to be a unionist any more.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Few, however, have attempted anything on the scale of this effort of Bearsden Choir and musical director Andrew Nunn.This complete performance of Vivaldirsquos Gloria, composed more than three centuries ago and last sung by Bearsden Choir at their  Christmas concert, was an elaborate jigsaw that has come together to make a remarkable sonic ndash and visual ndash picture. The sheer scale of the achievement is quite breathtaking, as a little arithmetic quickly makes clear.Recording and filming their own contributions at home,  members of the choir submitted their voices to the choruses. They were guided by film of Nunn conducting and the voices of four young soloists ndash soprano Ellen Mawhinney, mezzo Penelope Cousland, tenor Matthew McKinney and bass Andrew MacTaggart ndash with the women also supplying the voices for the solo movements.Those contributions were recorded, and filmed, in March in Glasgowrsquos elegant Trades House, with the eight-piece McOpera Ensemble, led by violinist Katie Hull. The assembling and editing of all this by Andrew Forbes and Demus Productions involved somewhere in the region of  dferent files, by my back-of-an-envelope calculation.That the choirrsquos sections sound like integrated units from the opening Gloria chorus is the first wonder, and that level of co-ordination speaks volumes for how well-trained this group of singers has been in recent years. Even in choruses where the timing is tricky in live performance, like the sixth movementrsquos Domine Fili Unigente, the choir sings as one, and right through to the closing Cum Sancto Spiritu, with its muscular opening by the basses, the smaller tenor section makes its presence felt.There is a wide age range in Bearsden Choir and some younger voices undoubtedly help produce the bright soprano sound. The two young soloists also make memorable contributions, firstly Mawhinney, particularly in duo with Amy Turnerrsquos oboe in the fth movement, Domine Deus, Rex Coelestis, and then Cousland on the deeply moving Domine Deus, Agnus Dei with cello and chamber organ continuo.If current progress against the health emergency continues, we must hope that it will not be long before the members of Bearsden Choir can meet together in person and audiences can enjoy their sound in Glasgow City Halls once more.

global effort went into narrowing down the exact landing area for fragments of meteorite it shot into the sky.Data from a network of cameras across the UK and Europe was analysed in Australia to narrow the search area.But alongside the scientic expertise used to trace what would become known as the Winchcombe Meteorite, it was a layperson who made the incredibly precious find.Mira Ihasz is the partner of Glasgow University planetary geoscientist Luke Daly and was thrilled to have the chance to travel to Gloucestershire to join the search.\"Luke is always talking about the camera network and he was always crossing the country setting up cameras on peoples rooftops.\"For years I was thinking, One day we will have a meteorite and when that day comes I will make sure I am there and go out and hunt.\"The search was lead by Luke, who helped set up the UK Fireball Alliance, a sky-camera network which caught sight of the meteorite when it blasted through the earthrsquos upper atmosphere, and PhD student Aine OrsquoBrien.Luke had lived in Australia for several years and was part of the Desert Fireball Network in the Australian outback.On histo the UK he wanted to be involved in a similar project to try and track meteorites by imaging the night sky.Around one meteorite a year lands on UK soil but the last found was  years ago.Luke said: \"Not many folk were looking up over the past  years so it was pure luck before when one was found and now were trying to create our own luck.\"It turns out there are loads of people out there interested in looking at meteors in the UK.\"So we got together and said, More data is better, were all trying to do the same thing, lets work together for the same aim,\"We were making sure we could share our data really quickly and thats essentially what allowed the Winchcombe meteorite recovery to happen so quickly because all the cameras from all the networks saw it.\"We knew it had dropped rocks within six hours and we knew where they were within a three kilometre box within three days.\"Finding the meteorite quickly was vital as the rocks are quickly contaminated by the earths environment - but there was a slight delay.The Australian scientist who was the only person who could understand the scientic modelling to track the meteorite was enjoying a local bank holiday windsurfing.But finally they had their location in the Cotswolds and a team of around  scientists set off to scour fields for small pieces of rock.A television appeal led to one family realising a charcoal coloured splatter on their driveway had travelled across the solar system to crash land outside their house.But the team knew there were more pieces to be uncovered.Aine said: \"It felt like a movie of the fireball alliance - all these dferent networks coming together, combining their data.\"There were five fragments in total. Four were found by members of the public on their own land after seeing people like Luke on the news saying looking out for a bit of black rock.\"The first piece was the piece on the driveway that got splatted and even made a little dent, which is amazing, a tiny little crater about five centimetres deep.\"We spent five or six days going up and down fields and knocking on doors and very politely asking a lot of very posh people - because its very wealthy in the Gloucestershire countryside - you may have seen on the news theres been a fireball, youve got a lovely big field, wed like to search it.\"Meteorites are shiny black rocks and just look like poo. We spent all week thinking we had found it and then it turning out to be just poo - sheep poo, rabbit poo, deer poo, all the British animals have meteorite-sized poo.\"So we spent a lot of time on meteor-wrongs.\"Mira, originally from Hungary, was quietly confident she would be the one to spot the meteor-right. Before setting out on the search her mum had told her she felt she would be successfu.She said: \"I was hoping they didnt find it so that on the day I arrived, the Saturday, we could find it together.\"We went out to a field full of sheep poos. I really felt after an hour so embarrassed not being a scientist and not knowing what is a meteorite because it is completely dferent from being in a museum with the spotlight where it glitters.\"I was focusing so hard, going everywhere, turning over every single blade of glass.\"Mira started to feel embarrassed, as the only non-scientist, to be constantly asking the others to double-check what she had spotted.But then she struck lucky.She said: \"I was behind everyone and I was telling myself to catch up with the others but I saw something and I wasnt sure.\"When Luke arrived and said This is it I had a complete blackout. I was not believing him. Youre asking a scientist Are you sure this is what you are studying for  years \"Everybody was just celebrating and jumping. It was such a moment. I think when you win the Lottery you are probably not as enthusiastic.\"My heart was beating like crazy. I could not believe it. It was once in a letime.\"And once you see it you realise it is nothing like a poo really.\"One of the residents who had seen the search left the team a bottle of whisky and glasses to celebrate, a much appreciated gesture given hugs and high fives were off the cards for covid reasons.The law states that rocks belong to the land owner but, fortunately, five were donated to the Natural History Museum and work immediately began to study to the meteorite and find out what answers it might give to some of les huge questions.The rock is one of the rarest - a carbonaceous chondrite, an ancient structure holding the building blocks of planets.Pieces of it are now being sold on the black market for thousands of pounds but for the scientists, it is priceless.Fortunately, following its journey across the solar system, the section of rock found by Mira landed in mud, which helped to protect it.Aine has been studying the rock. She said: \"The pieces I get are half a gram, so tiny little chips at a time. I have to put them in to a little pestle and mortar.\"I am quite a clumsy person and this is ultra precious rock so when Im in the lab it is so so scary - you breath and this stuff is basically dust.\"Winchcombe is an incredible find because, unlike the other , meteorites worldwide, it is possible to trace its parent asteroid and know where it came from.It formed before there were planets in our solar system and contains the dust and gas from when there was only the sun and a disc around it.Luke said: \"NASA and the Japanese space agency have spent billions of dollars sending probes to asteroids to bring back g from water rich asteroids and we got g in a field.\"All the minerals inside it were formed in the first few millions years of our solar systems history, basically its got all the building blocks you would ever want to seed a planet to jump start the origin of le.\"Studying meteorites like Winchombe, the fact we got it so fast means theres going to be stuff we dont usually see in other meteorites of this type, which is really exciting.\"So were just talking about small questions like origin of the solar system, origin of water, origin of le - just the trivial stuff in this wee little rock that Mira found in a field hopefully will bring us some answers.\"Aine says the meteorites discovery feels like a mirror to the pandemic, a global scientic effort that needed the support of ordinary people.During lockdown, residents might have been hostile to having visitors arrive from other parts of the UK but the team was welcomed.She said: \"People in France had cameras, people in Holland had cameras, people in Australia were doing the maths. Its similar to what the covid effort is.\"When people donated the meteorite one of the things they said was, We want to do this because were so grateful to what scientists have achieved and given to us with developing the vaccine.\"They were just so grateful, this couple, for everything scientists had done.\"It just feels like this really special thing, this lockdown meteorite. Socially, culturally, the fact it was a citizen science effort and people got excited about it in a way they might not have before the pandemic.\"It felt like a bit of a cultural phenomenon.\"A piece of the Winchcombe meteorite is now on display in the Natural History Museum and will be displayed in the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow University."},{"url":null,"title":"four-five-adults-favour-ban-smoking-outside-schools","story":"Charity partnership Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Scotland surveyed , adults in Scotland and found four in fivewant smoking outside the school gates to be prohibited.The charity said passive smoking, while harmful to all, is particularly dangerous for babies and children as their lungs are still growing.It said youngsters breathing in other peoples smoke could face slowing lung growth and an increased risk of developing asthma.The charity is now calling for Scotland to follow Wales in banning smoking around areas where children and young people spend their time, such as school grounds and play areas.Joseph Carter, head of Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Scotland, said: \"To reach Scotlands smoke-free target of less than % of adults smoking by , we need to stop normalising smoking around children.\"Passive smoking not only has detrimental health effects on childrens lungs, but it also increases the likelihood that they too will become smokers later in le.\"It is vital that we protect the next generations lungs from the effects of smoke.\"He added: \"That is why we are calling for the new Government to commit to banning smoking around schools and playgrounds.\"Alexander Stewart, Scottish Conservative MSP and Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Scotlands smoking cessation champion, said the survey results come as no surprise.He said he is wholeheartedly behind a ban, adding: \"Children look up to adults, especially parents, relatives or carers andthey smoke, they run the risk of allowing their children to consider the habit as a normal thing to pursue.\"As Asthma UK and British Lung Foundations smoking cessation champion, I will do all I can to get the message across that we must stop this normalisation of smoking and to join our collective push for a complete ban on smoking at school gates.\"A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Stopping smoking at any time is one of the best things you can do for your health, and we will always consider proposals from Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Scotland.\"Children are more vulnerable to breathing in polluted air than adults as their airways are smaller and still developing. We also know that children breathe faster than adults, and therefore breathe in more of the harmful chemicals contained in second-hand smoke. Adults that do smoke should make sure they are not in close proximity to children or young people when doing so.\"Targeted media campaigns, including social media campaigns, are regularly undertaken to ensure that message is getting through.

Cells are made for two. They hold . There are no mattresses, said Urbanovich, who added he was locked up after a three-minute hearing. Prisoners sit or lie on the floor.His story was corroborated by another opposition figure, Nikolai Kozlov, who spent  days inside the same jail. It was, he said, ldquotorture.Mr Kozlov, leader of a small pro-democracy party, described a man, an intellectual, stripped bare and forced to go into a cell of  people. But it was the bleach he found horrying, it was far too concentrated, he said. ldquoWithin  seconds peoplersquos eyes started to water, and noses. People started to cough, Mr Kozlov said. ldquoThere is a vomit reflex. Somebody started to turn red and blue.Back in April, Belarusian authorities denied torturing prisoners with bleach. They said the chemical ndash which in the former Soviet Union is sometimes still sold as a powder and can therefore be added to water at dangerous concentrations ndash was used properly and designed to protect inmates from coronavirus.The same ubiquitous powder, called khlorka in Russian, was used to mistreat prisoners under Communism.Stories of abuse ndash beatings, rapes and sleep deprivation torture ndash continue to come out of the country.Yesterday, The Times reported testimony from a doctor, Olga Pavlova, who was beaten in prison and denied medical treatment.She shared a cell designed for four with  women. The toilet was a hole in the floor.She said guards were sadists, especially one woman. ldquoShe kicked the men, mostly in the groin, Ms Pavlova said ldquoShe also kicked women when they were lined up against the wall to make them stretch their legs as widely as possible. The pain was unbearable.DictatorshipA human rights group called Viasna, or Spring, has described the repressions in Belarus as the worst in Europe for  years. But there is little free media in the country to report the atrocities or even keep count of prisoners .Thousands are thought to have been through Okrestina and other jails. Viasna says the country currently has more than  political prisoners.Mr Urbanovichrsquos latest disappearance was reported by his group last Saturday. But the detention of inidual democrats in Belarus, the country long dubbed Europersquos last dictatorship, is so routine it doesnrsquot usually make international news.Until, that is, the arrests get too crazy, too brazen to ignore. The day after Malady Front announced Mr Urbanovich had been seized, a regular Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius flying over Belarus was forced to the ground by a fake bomb threat ndash and a MiG- fighter.On board was RamanPratasevich, a -year-old Belarussian blogger and opposition activist, and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, . Both were detained and both were later filmed making clearly scripted statements. Ms Sapega is thought to have spent at least some time in Okrestina.This was a ldquogasp moment. Something so shocking it sparked a chorus of demands for action against Belarusrsquos hardman president, Alexander Lukashenka, the -year-old former collective farm manager who has run this corner of Europe since .His regime has broken an unwritten rule. Authoritarian rulers can, with relative impunity, abuse their citizens inside their borders. But when they start to impose force where, such as on an international flight, other states get nervous.Yesterday, the United States signalled it would impose sanctions against a clutch of state-owned enterprises. The European Union has already effectively barred Belarusian planes from its airspace. So has the UK and Ukraine.Thanks to flight-tracking websites, this ban was, unusually, graphically visible. Images grabbed from such sites shared on social media showed the flat square of Belarus with an empty sky while the rest of the continent was covered in little digital planes.HijackingA journalist specialising in the former USSR spotted one Belarusian aircraft, a Belavia holiday flight to Barcelona, looping back and forth as it waited in vain for permission to cross in to Poland and the EU.ldquoThe poor passengers of this Belavia plane are a metaphor for the whole country, tweeted Peter Leonard with a picture of the jetrsquos spiralling flightpath. ldquoTrapped and endangered by the mad, irresponsible behaviour of their leader and forced to go in circles.You can only fly east from Belarus ndash to Russia, whose own authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin, is a rare ally of Mr Lukashenka.The Belarus leader made such a trip on Friday, meeting his Kremlin counterpart in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. He took with him, official communiques said, a package of documents on the arrest of Mr Pratasevich.It is not clearRussia helped the Belarusians carry out what most in the West see as a hijacking. But Kremlin media has certainly provided PR support.The editor-in-chief of RT, the main international mouthpiece of Mr Putin, praised Mr Lukashenkarsquos actions. It was claimed one of her correspondents in Minsk had unleashed a foul-mouthed attack on Mr Pratasevich, ending in calls for his death.This is the same outlet where Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, and Scottish ultra-unionist George Galloway, have regular shows.In the brief public part of their three-hour meeting the Belarussian leader told MrPutin it was clear what ldquoour Western friends want ndash what is there here to discuss He means the West is trying to overthrow his government ndash and thatof Mr Putin.The leaders of the two countries ndash which share air defences and border controls as part of a loose union arrangement ndash routinely portray their domestic critics as stooges of the EU or the US.They live in fear of what they call ldquocolour revolutions, popular uprisings against repressive or corrupt regimes in their region, including their one-time Ukrainian ally, Viktor Yanukovych, overthrown in .For Mr Lukashenka and Mr Putin, these movements are the product of Western interference, of European or American secret services. Or at least that is what they claim.Mr Lukashenka is widely thought to have lost presidential elections in the summer of . Official results suggest he got four out of five votes.RevolutionThe suspected real winner, human rights campaigner Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, is in exile in Lithuania. Her husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, marked a year behind bars yesterday.The detentions of Mr Pratasevich, Ms Sapega, Mr Urbanovich, Ms Pavlova, Mr Kozlov and hundreds of others are all linked to protests against Belarusrsquos stolen  presidential election.As Mr Lukashenka and Mr Putin met in Sochi, their supporters were once again smearing these democrats as agents of regime change.Belarus, they say, is holding off another ldquocolour revolution. The colours in this case are the red and white of the old Belarus flag. Those in prison, reports suggest, include somebody locked up for wearing red and white socks.ldquoThe meeting is very important for the West to get a clear message that they might have been able to buy off Ukraine, but not all slavic peoples will sell themselves for three kopecks, Viktor Vodolatsky, a deputy for Mr Putinrsquos United Russia party, told Moscowrsquos Izvestia paper after the Sochi event.ldquoWestern secret services are today trying to ignite flashpoints for civil war around Russia. This presidential summit is designed to show everybody that Russia will not abandon the Belarusian people.Is the West ndash whatever that is ndash really trying to bring down Mr Lukashenka  Well, certainly not very hard. Until this week sanctions were modest.And the Belarusian regime has been propped up by pound million worth of bonds it sold on the UK market last year.Democracy campaigners last week called for investors to pull the plug on the dictator. The value of the bonds ndashessentially IOUs from Mr Lukashenka ndash dipped after the Ryanair incident. But they are paying high yields, so Europersquos last dictatorship is bankrolled in the City.In fact, Mr Lukashenkarsquos relationship with Western neighbours has not always been terrible. It has had moments of rapprochement.World leaders will put up with a lot ndash even the bleaching of political prisoners ndash for a bit of stability.The Ryanair incident, however, was a Rubicon crossed. ldquoI think the chance of any normalisation with Mr Lukashenka in charge is gone, one Western diplomat told Saturdayrsquos Financial Times.ldquoThe main message of this exercise was lsquohe can catch you anywherersquo. The old KGB message.The secret police in Belarus are still called the KGB. The main Minsk thoroughfare out towards Okrestina jail is Prospekt Dzerzhinskogo, named after the Polish aristocrat revolutionary who founded Communist Russiarsquos first spy service, the Cheka.But the US, EU and UK will not be happy with outfits like Mr Lukashenkarsquos KGB operating inside their borders.A report earlier this year by FreedomHouse identied more than  cases since  of what it called ldquotransnational repression, when authoritarian regimes crossed their borders to pursue their critics.The dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in his own countryrsquos embassy in Istanbul in . There was the attempted assassination with an illegal chemical weapon of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England the same year.It is more common for authoritarian states, including those less brutal than Belarus, to use international bodies like Interpol ndash or existing extradition arrangements ndash to try to bring critics home for punishment.Nate Schenkkan was one of the authors of the Freedom House report. He thinks a tough line is needed to stop transnational repression.ldquoThe only way to put a stop to this ugly trend, he wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine this week, ldquois to make that gamble far riskier by hitting back hard against perpetrators ndash including Lukashenka ndash and demonstrating to autocrats that they will pay a steep price for carrying out such crimes.There is only so much even Mr Lukashenka can bleach."},{"url":null,"title":"st-andrews-primary-school-ayrshire-closes-week-several-confirmed-covid-cases","story":"St Andrews Primary School in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire,

The brutal treatment of Floyd, the subsequent anti-racism protests and the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters, also inspired her to write a new song, What About Us , after she learned to play guitar during lockdown.Rachel, who had just started on Broadway in the multi-award-winning musical Come From Away when the pandemic hit in March , has released a new EP titled Lessons containing the original track and a second self-composition, The View, about the pressures of social media.She said: “Locked up at home in London, I was seeing all these things happening in the news and just couldn’t ignore them.“The murder of George Floyd and that horrendous nine-minute footage of the police officer kneeling on his neck seriously made me sick to the stomach. I didn’t feel like talking for days. I didn’t go onto social media or celebrate my birthday.“What we witnessed meant we couldn’t avoid it it was there for the whole world to see, and it forced us to stand up and take account of how this was happening to mainly young black men.“Floyd’s murder was a turning point for me. I couldn’t be a bystander anymore.Since then I’ve refused to let racist comments go by the way I might’ve done in the past. It’s a hard conversation to have with someone, to tell them: ‘Can you please not say that ’“No one wants to be that person who’s pulling people up, but I really believe that we’re all partaking in racismwe don’t stand up and say ‘stop’ and call people out.“It doesn’t have to be done in a way that starts a fight, but instead in a way that encourages conversations and makes people more aware of what they’re saying.”Rachel said she had always wanted to learn to play the guitar so when Come From Away was postponed after  shows and she had to fly back to the UK, she used the free time to begin twice weekly Zoom lessons.Her teacher was Dan Giles, her musical director and collaborator, and together they worked on several new songs.When the material was finished Rachel and Dan recorded the tracks in a converted shed using hung-up duvets to soak up the sound. They then headed into a studio in Guildford with a socially distanced four-piece band to record the EP. Lessons also features several covers — The Beatles’ Blackbird, Nick Cave’s The Ship Song and In The Arms Of An Angel by Sarah McLachlan.“I really enjoyed the writing process and learning to play the guitar,” said Rachel.“I was very fortunate to have a creative outlet over lockdown when so many people in the arts were out of work.“Of course it was disappointing that Come From Away was pulled after only  shows, but I think it would have been much more devastatingI’d had to stop for personal reasons. As it was, the whole world was in the same position.”Rachel, who also starred in the West End and Broadway productions of Wicked, is expecting toto New York in September for the reopening of Come From Away.The Canadian musical is set in the week following the September  attacks and tells the true story of what happened when  planes were ordered to land unexpectedly in the small Canadian town of Gander. Rachel picked up an Olivier nod for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical for the role.However, with theatres closed for almost a year-and-a-half, Rachel auditioned for straight drama roles in television, securing a guest slot in Holby City and a part in new BBC series Hope Street, currently being filmed in Northern Ireland.It’s her first time acting in a TV show back home and she’s loving it. The mum-of-one was due to come back to Belfast with husband Guy Retallack and their young son Ben at Christmas, but the pandemic forced them to cancel.“Television is such a dferent discipline to stage but I’m really enjoying it and would absolutely love to do more,” she said.“And it’s so lovely to be home and shooting in Northern Ireland for the first time.“I’m taking the positives out of the last year. If theatres hadn’t closed, I wouldn’t have applied for these roles, so there have been some silver linings.”Lessons is available for purchase at https:racheltucker and on iTunes and Spoty..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolChristian Jessen: I am down to my last £k, says TV doctor after being ordered to pay Arlene Foster £k in libel damagesMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots: Northern Ireland being used as #plaything# by EULatest Northern IrelandThe pursuit of happiness…  it’s all smiles in Orchard countyBest of Friends… Tim McGarry hails Matt LeBlanc viral memesCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new positive cases reportedMore than , crimes committed in Northern Ireland’s police stations in five yearsBelfast City Airport announces new CEOLatestThe pursuit of happiness…  it’s all smiles in Orchard countyBest of Friends… Tim McGarry hails Matt LeBlanc viral memesBiden commemorates sacrices of US war dead to mark Memorial DayTrent Boult set to miss England series to focus on World Test Championship finalGareth Southgate ready to trim seven players from England squad for Euro ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Peter MorrisonMark BainTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMost of the time you can just tell there is a smile lurking behind the mask.It’s the eyes. The small creases at the corners, the twinkle, the gentle nod of the head.In Armagh you will spot those twinkling eyes sparkle around every corner, in every shop. A laugh isn’t too far away either. Andit’s not your home town don’t worry. The smiles are there for everyone. And before you know it the conversational greeting has developed into stories, the time of day passes amicably and step out of a shop feeling just a little better, a little more valued than you did a few minutes before.That might be the secret why, in the Orchard county of Armagh, you will find the happiest people on the island of Ireland. The Dixieland strains of Louise Armstrong could follow you around the narrow streets of the city centre that’s no bigger than a town. When you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you... happiness spreads, and nothing makes the people of Armagh happier than spreading happiness.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Church of Ireland Cathedral.

Photo by Peter MorrisonIt may, of course, be put down to the relaxation of Covid restrictions that happiness abounds. The cafés are full, the shops are open, the people have emerged from a winter of hibernation, but there’s a spring in the steps along the streets.But it is more than that.“If you’re not from Armagh we’ll just ask you where you’re from,” said Dorothy Arnold, who runs The Flower Bowl. It’s a hard shop not to be happy in, all bright colours and wonderful smells. And before you know it, you’re lost in conversation.“We only get one chance to make an impression in le, so we might at least try to make it a good one,” she said.“I’ve been here for decades. Armagh is a lovely place to work. It’s a county where the garden is never the same. We’re surrounded by an ever changing countryside, depending on the season. It keeps everything fresh and feeling new.”She chats on about the joy of intimate weddings she has been involved with, the sadness of funerals where her flowers replaced the hugs families longed for. Even that brings a smile.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHans Cousins selling fish in the city centre.

Photo by Peter Morrison“We love talking to people,” she said. “That’s the nature of this place. Everyone’s a friend. Walk down the street and you’ll see. You’ll get hellos from people you’ve never seen before.”And she’s right. Standing outside the town hall, fishmonger Hans Cousins is in town with his weekly catch from the Irish Sea. Several customers walk up to his van and each one of them is quickly engaged in laughter.“I’ve been coming here for over  years and this is by far the easiest part of the job,” he said. “There’s never a bother. We’re removed from city le. Everything is a slower pace.”Then we’re off talking again, with tales of his own boat, the issues over fishing times, the over zealous nature of parking attendants before being pointed in the direction of TG Hawthorne, one of the longest established businesses in Armagh.“Geoff always has a smile,” said Hans.He was right, and we’re off again with the stories starting to roll from the tongue.

The shop has grown with the town, we chat to everyone who comes inthey want a conversation and maybe that makes the smallest dference to their day.“You should go and see Joanne in her pub. She always has a smile...”The trail continues. The Hole In The Wall, Joanne Shilliday tells us, is so-called as it used to be the town jail, and taking pity people would pass food through a hole to those inside. Now a pub, the building has stood since . She delights in telling the stories of days gone by.“It’s the rule to wave at strangers,” she said, turning back to the reason for calling.“If you live here you can walk down the street and always see people you know. Go away from the town centre and you have countryside, fresh air, a reasonably stress free le.

Enough to make anyone miserable, you’d think. Not Barry. He greets with a wave and a smile. Shoppers pass and not a single one goes by without that same treatment.“I’ve got a word for everyone!” he waves and shouts across the car park.He brings out his co-worker, David McCoy.“I’ve been very happy here,” said David, who has Down’s Syndrome. Clearly the joie de vivre has rubbed off.“I just like greeting people and making them welcome,” he added.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBarry Loughran is all smiles welcoming people to the shopping centre.

He stops briefly, pulls a face at a small child in a pram to giggles.“I don’t knowit’s the fresh air, that homes are cheaper to buy, that we’re living in a small, close knit town and have rolling fields around us, but I don’t feel stressed,” said Joanne on the way back to The Hole in the Wall.Happiness amongst the people of Armagh radiates out from the commercial centre into the surrounding countryside where a peaceful lestyle can be found, away from the city centre masses and impersonal suburbs. It finds a way back in the smiles of those who come to town.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe people in Armagh are some of the happiest in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe people in Armagh are some of the happiest in Northern IrelandHappiness is contagious and Co Armagh folk, it seems, have caught it more than anywhere  in Ireland..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolChristian Jessen: I am down to my last £k, says TV doctor after being ordered to pay Arlene Foster £k in libel damagesMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots: Northern Ireland being used as #plaything# by EULatest Northern IrelandBest of Friends… Tim McGarry hails Matt LeBlanc viral memesCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new positive cases reportedMore than , crimes committed in Northern Ireland’s police stations in five yearsBelfast City Airport announces new CEOUUP leader Doug Beattie warns DUP and Sinn Fein against collapsing StormontLatestBest of Friends… Tim McGarry hails Matt LeBlanc viral memesGareth Southgate ready to trim seven players from England squad for Euro Woman’s body pulled from river in BerkshireJames Bracey determined to make himself impossible for England to ignoreBank Holiday Monday UK’s hottest day of the year so far,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Rebecca Black PA WireRodney EdwardsTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNew Democratic Unionist Partyleader Edwin Poots is facing a string of resignations as Northern Ireland’s largest party continues to implode.It is understood a number of DUP members, including elected representatives, will quit the party this week as the fallout over the ousting of former leader Arlene Foster intensies. “I will be resigning this week and there will be others too,” said one elected representative.Read MoreCops probe ‘text threat’ to DUP man whose brother was UDA victim     Andrew Madden and Gareth Cross:OpinionThe weekly political spin: Popcorn at the ready, DUP ision and SDLP Skywalker It comes as the Police Service of Northern Irelandinvestigates allegations the Ulster Defence Association , an illegal loyalist group, issued sinister threats to a leadership contender’s campaign team in a bid to thwart the result.Jeffrey Donaldson, a Lagan Valley MP, made the claim as Mr Poots was being ratied as leader during a “fractious”, private DUP meeting in Belfast last week.One party member who was in attendance accepted there can be “legitimate lobbying” by loyalists, “but what Jeffrey was referring to was not ambiguous in any way”. It’s understood the basis of some of the complaints revolve around “intimidating and threatening” messages sent to senior members of the DUP who are close to Mr Donaldson.According to sources, the words “you’re next” were among the alleged threats directed at members of Donaldson’s team, while other exchanges were made on the phone and email.A PSNI spokeswoman said: “Police have received a complaint that a number of members of a political party had been threatened during a recent leadership campaign.”The Sunday Independent previously reported how the UDA’s “shadowy figures” had deployed bully-boy tactics by threatening DUP members to sign a letter of no confidence in Ms Foster.It was claimed that several loyalists helped to enlist support by “reminding” some MLAs thatthey did not sign the motion, their seats at next year’s Assembly election would be in jeopardy.During Mr Poots’ acceptance speech several prominent DUP members, including Mr Donaldson and Diane Dodds left the meeting on Thursday night.In a further twist, Ms Foster’s close friend and colleague in her Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, Paul Bell, dramatically resigned from the party after Mr Poots’ ratication.Mr Bell warned the DUP will lose “thousands of votes” over the recent course of events.“We cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, but because of what took place before the election,” he said.A party ided, a police probe and several resignations within the next week are not the only issues Poots must deal with.His choice of first minister and how he responds to outstanding issues such as the implementation of Irish language legislation and the Northern Ireland protocol will be watched closely by Sinn Féin, his partners in government.Read MoreGail Walker:OpinionWhy Poots’ and Paisley’s Back to the Future strategy casts a shadow over not just the DUP but the Union“It’s important to remember the majority of parties and ministers in the Executive do not support his position,” a Sinn Féin source said.The source said the party has not ruled out refusing to nominate a deputy first minister after Poots’ proposes Ms Foster’s replacement, who is believed to be former communities minister Paul Givan.He is partly blamed for the collapse of the devolved institutions four years ago, when he and his officials cut funding for an Irish language initiative and forced an early election.“I am hearing September mooted for a potential election,” said another source.In Dublin, Mr Poots’ first few weeks will be watched closely by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who is expected to speak to the DUP leader about the contentious issue of the protocol.Speaking after his election as leader, Mr Poots claimed relationships between Belfast and Dublin “are really, really bad”.Meanwhile, the British-Irish Council will take place in Co Fermanagh next month, where Mr Martin, along with the UK government’s Michael Gove and Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon, will meet with leaders from Wales, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Northern Ireland.However, who will be leading Stormont remains to be seen as Ms Foster, who is still first minister, has threatened to quit this Tuesday — weeks earlier than planned —Mr Poots names her successor..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesChristian Jessen: I am down to my last £k, says TV doctor after being ordered to pay Arlene Foster £k in libel damagesBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots: Northern Ireland being used as #plaything# by EULatest PoliticsUUP leader Doug Beattie warns DUP and Sinn Fein against collapsing StormontUlster Unionists more appealing than DUP, claims young loyalist who warned of possible violence over NI Protocol Brexit: Edwin Poots says no to Swiss-style deal on trade over Irish SeaBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorLatestWoman’s body pulled from river in BerkshireJames Bracey determined to make himself impossible for England to ignoreBank Holiday Monday UK’s hottest day of the year so farSergio Aguero to join Barcelona following Manchester City exitCredit and debit card spending jumps by %,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueArlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill at the Strand Arts Centre.May   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFrom the DUP in turmoil to MLAs needing Yoda#s wisdom, Andrew Madden and Gareth Cross take a closer look at some of the more unusual things in the Assembly and further afield this week.Monday: Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster forgot her worries on Monday, with a trip to the cinema in east Belfast with deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill.The pair were snapped with large boxes of popcorn as they joined pensioners at the Strand Arts Centre, as coronavirus restrictions lted, for a showing of classic short films.During the visit Mrs Foster questioned the existence of a letter of no-confidence against her signed by DUP MLAs and MPs that led to her downfall. It#s now been nearly four weeks since I heard about it and I still haven#t seen it, she said.In the Assembly, Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs she saw no substantive reason for a judge-led review into the Bobby Storey funeral. Ms O#Neill said it was time to get on with rebuilding our economy rather than continuing to focus on the funeral of the former IRA member.New UUP leader Doug Beattie said issues around the funeral could affect the future of Stormont itselfnot addressed, warning of terminal decline”.A busy week for Edwin Poots began with him answering a question from Jim Allister about compensation for slaughtered animals. Mr Poots, in his written answer, revealed that in   his department paid £,, in compensation for animals slaughtered for disease control purposes. Of this, £,, related to bovine Tuberculosis £, related to avian influenza and £, for Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis.Tuesday: The Assembly debated Finance Minister Conor Murphy#s budget with MLAs highly critical.Finance Committee chair Steve Aiken said it was hard to scrutinise the budget given its limited granularity, occasional evasions and obfuscations from departments.SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole criticised NHS waiting lists, saying we should be ashamed and the budget contained no plans to address his concerns.The DUP#s Paul Frew responded, saying it was refreshing to hear Luke Skywalker in the corner, although he did sound more like Chewbacca at times, he looks to a truth that we all need the wisdom of Yoda in times of stress like this”.Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon was also critical of new DUP leader#s Edwin Poots# refusal to attend meetings of north-south bodies saying it was hugely frustrating the meetings had been deliberately obstructed.TUV leader Jim Allister said he hoped Mr Poots would refuse to engage until the Northern Ireland Protocol was dismantled, saying it had trashed east-west relations. Later the new DUP leader said he remained committed to all his obligations, but north-south relations had never been worse.Arlene Foster continued to throw herself into events to forget her troubles during her final days as First Minister.During a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Dundonald she said: “Regardless of what’s happening where, a visit to a school never fails to lt my spirits. Meeting young people is always a humbling, but invigorating experience.Wednesday: Unionists were sacriced for the Northern Ireland Protocol, Westminster#s NI Affairs Committee heard.PUP Belfast councillor Dr John Kyle said nationalists and unionists had not been treated equally during the Brexit process.The identity and ethos of the unionist community, as equal citizens with everyone  in the United Kingdom, was sacriced, he said.Dr Kyle did accept the protocol may have some economic benefits, but added for many unionists being British is more important than being prosperous.In the Assembly the Education Committee heard evidence from the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland .Chair Brendan Morgan revealed that in nine months’ time organisations in Northern Ireland would no longer have access to the EU safeguarding database which is used to for background checks on applicants as a result of Brexit.“Is Brexit is actually exposing our children to potential risk , Sinn Fein#s Pat Sheehan asked.“As of September , we will no longer have access to that database which screens professional teachers,” Mr Morgan explained.Thursday: What was supposed to be a formal ratication process for his leadership of the DUP turned into a nightmare for Edwin Poots.As new UUP leader Doug Beattie contentedly sipped a whiskey after being unanimously elected to lead his party, a DUP rubber stamping exercise laid the party#s isions bare for the world to see.While an attempt to hold a secret ballot to confirm Mr Poots# leadership was rejected, senior party figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Gregory Campbell and Diane Dodds walked out while he was making his acceptance speech.Outgoing leader Arlene Foster also left early, and as a waiting media asked her for information on what was happening inside, a cheerful Mrs Foster quipped you#ll soon find out and flashed a peace sign.Paul Bell, a member of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP for over  years, emotionally quit and said the party would haemorrhage votes as a result of Mrs Foster#s treatment.The issue of nurses’ pay was back of the agenda. Alex Easton asked Health Minister Robin Swann, in an Assembly question, about plans for a pay rise in the coming year.Mr Swann responded: “The pay round for   for NHS and HSC staff has not yet been finalised. Any decision on a pay award for nurses and other NI health workers, will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations..Mr Swann said he was “committed to a fair pay settlement for all our healthcare staff going forward”Friday: The fallout from the DUP#s leadership fiasco continued into Friday. After reports that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told Thursday#s meeting that his campaign team had been subjected to threats and intimidation from the UDA, there were calls for a police investigation.Sinn Fein#s North Belfast MP John Finucane called the claims deeply disturbing.If true, this is a very worrying development that an armed, illegal organisation was involved in influencing the outcome of the leadership contest of the largest party in unionism and a party of government, he said.It represents an attempt to subvert the democratic process and that is totally unacceptable.Arlene Foster announced she would stand down from the role on Tuesdayher replacement Edwin Poots proceeds with an Executive reshuffle.She also had some advice for her successor: There are very many good people who vote for us, who support us but he needs to recognise there is a lot of work to do in terms of healing isions that are quite obviously there in the party..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesChristian Jessen: I am down to my last £k, says TV doctor after being ordered to pay Arlene Foster £k in libel damagesBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots: Northern Ireland being used as #plaything# by EULatest PoliticsUUP leader Doug Beattie warns DUP and Sinn Fein against collapsing StormontUlster Unionists more appealing than DUP, claims young loyalist who warned of possible violence over NI Protocol Brexit: Edwin Poots says no to Swiss-style deal on trade over Irish SeaBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorLatestJames Bracey determined to make himself impossible for England to ignoreBank Holiday Monday UK’s hottest day of the year so farSergio Aguero to join Barcelona following Manchester City exitCredit and debit card spending jumps by %Hamas says Gaza calm depends on Israeli actions in Jerusalem,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Devine is the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year and is looking forward to ato the ERC series where he has produced a number of eye catching drives since he took a debut podium on Rally Hungary in . “I can’t wait to get my ERC season up and running,” Devine commented. We’ve got some testing under our belt in the new car and it feels really good, but there’s nothing better than actual competition to see where you’re at. googletag.cmd.push Rally Poland will be a new event to me as it didn’t run last year so we are going to do Rally Žemaitija in Lithuania as a warm up beforehand to get up to speed. Last year’s ERC campaign didn’t get off to a good start but we finished well and I’m hoping to take that momentum into . It takes a lot of backing to mount a challenge at this level and I’m delighted to welcome some new partners on board this season including Parts For Cars, Lyons of Limerick, Rentokil Initial, Trailerstuff.ie and Fire Protection Ireland. Without them and existing backers like Curran Gate, Pirelli, TST Transport, EARS Motorsport, Marina Racewear and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy, this season just wouldn’t be possible.” googletag.cmd.push The move to a Ford will see Callumto a brand he’s rallied with before and M-Sport will be keeping a watchful eye on Callum’s progress this season.“The European Rally Championship has long been a proving ground for young talent looking to make their mark on the world stage, and it’s great to see another young driver choosing to take this route with the Fiesta. saidM-Sport Managing Director, Malcolm Wilson OBE. We’ve been aware of Callum for a number of years now following strong performances with the Fiesta R in Junior WRC and Fiesta R in Ireland. He’s got talent, and I’m keen to see what he can do as he tackles some ofEurope’s most famous events with the Fiesta Rally.”     M-Sport Ford Team Principal, Richard Millener added: “It’s great to see Callum back behind the wheel of the Fiesta and I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do this year. He had a great season with the Fiesta in , finishing third overall in the Irish Tarmac Championship and securing his first victory in Donegal – and we’re all keen to see him carry those performances onto the European stage. He’s already completed one year at this level, and now that he’s reunited with the Fiesta we want to help him take that next step. He’s got the initial experience under his belt, and we will give him as much support as we can to allow him to excel. The competition will be strong, but Callum is a very determined and talented young driver with the potential to surprise a few people this year.” Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Devine will be joined for his ERC adventure by co-driver James Fulton and the Championship will consist of eight rounds taking place in Poland, Latvia, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Azores, Portugal, Hungary and Gran Canarias.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon announced a raft of new measures in a bidto improve facilities for pedestrians and increase public space in the city centre. The measures included the introduction of a one-way system from Carlisle Road, through Ferryquay Gate into The Diamond. It was stated in March that the new traffic system would be operational from April. However, it has still not begun. When contacted by the Derry News about the delay, a spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructuresaid it was anticipated that the scheme would now commence in early June. googletag.cmd.push “The Department and Derry City and Strabane District Council continue to work collaboratively to implement measures to help better share street space in the city centre in preparation for the relaxation of the Covid restrictions and an increase in pedestrian numbers. “It is planned to introduce a one way system in Ferryquay Street as a temporary intervention and introduce a priority system at Shipquay Gate to provide safer pedestrian access at this busy location. “The work is anticipated to commence in early June.” A spokesperson for the local council also confirmed that the traffic measure are expected to commence in early June and added that the council is working closely with the Department and contractors in bringing this forward. googletag.cmd.push “Further information in relation to the planned works and impact on traffic in the city centre will be communicated to the public in advance,” the council spokesperson added. It is planned that the one-way system at Ferryquay Street will be in place for  months. A review on its impact will then be made. As well as the Ferryquay Street plans, the new measures put forward also include the removal of the existing parking area at the quadrant outside the former Austin’s department store in the Diamond. A priority system for traffic is also to be introduced at Shipquay Gate which will allow a new footway to be created under this historic gate.     New spaces are also to be created on Bishop Street to facilitate outdoor trading opportunities for cafeacute-type businesses. The scheme has been agreed in partnership with the council as part of the Covid recovery process. Speaking in March when she announced the planned measures for Derrys city centre, Mrs Mallonsaid: “The Covid pandemic has brought many changes to how we conduct our daily lives and as we move towards a recovery phase I want to play my part in the transformation that our society deserves. This means creating a greener, cleaner more sustainable environment with less reliance on motor vehicles and a renewed focus on those who wish to walk, wheel and cycle. Once completed these measures will transform the Derry cityscape, providing safe spaces for all who work and live there to meet, shop and travel. “I am also committed to working with other local councils, stakeholders and local people so that we can shape our future together and deliver similar changes across our villages, towns and cities.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon announced a raft of new measures in a bidto improve facilities for pedestrians and increase public space in the city centre. The measures included the introduction of a one-way system from Carlisle Road, through Ferryquay Gate into The Diamond. It was stated in March that the new traffic system would be operational from April. However, it has still not begun. When contacted by the Derry News about the delay, a spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructuresaid it was anticipated that the scheme would now commence in early June. googletag.cmd.push “The Department and Derry City and Strabane District Council continue to work collaboratively to implement measures to help better share street space in the city centre in preparation for the relaxation of the Covid restrictions and an increase in pedestrian numbers. “It is planned to introduce a one way system in Ferryquay Street as a temporary intervention and introduce a priority system at Shipquay Gate to provide safer pedestrian access at this busy location. “The work is anticipated to commence in early June.” A spokesperson for the local council also confirmed that the traffic measure are expected to commence in early June and added that the council is working closely with the Department and contractors in bringing this forward. googletag.cmd.push “Further information in relation to the planned works and impact on traffic in the city centre will be communicated to the public in advance,” the council spokesperson added. It is planned that the one-way system at Ferryquay Street will be in place for  months. A review on its impact will then be made. As well as the Ferryquay Street plans, the new measures put forward also include the removal of the existing parking area at the quadrant outside the former Austin’s department store in the Diamond. A priority system for traffic is also to be introduced at Shipquay Gate which will allow a new footway to be created under this historic gate.     New spaces are also to be created on Bishop Street to facilitate outdoor trading opportunities for cafeacute-type businesses. The scheme has been agreed in partnership with the council as part of the Covid recovery process. Speaking in March when she announced the planned measures for Derrys city centre, Mrs Mallonsaid: “The Covid pandemic has brought many changes to how we conduct our daily lives and as we move towards a recovery phase I want to play my part in the transformation that our society deserves. This means creating a greener, cleaner more sustainable environment with less reliance on motor vehicles and a renewed focus on those who wish to walk, wheel and cycle. Once completed these measures will transform the Derry cityscape, providing safe spaces for all who work and live there to meet, shop and travel. “I am also committed to working with other local councils, stakeholders and local people so that we can shape our future together and deliver similar changes across our villages, towns and cities.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Arts Council this week announced funding ofpoundm for arts organisations throughout Northern Ireland. The Arts Council’s Annual Funding Programmeis the most signicant allocation of public funding for the arts in Northern Ireland each year. Void Gallery in Derry is to receive pound,, while Greater Shantallow Community Artsis to be allocated pound,. GSCA aims to provide direct access to the arts for those living in disadvantaged communities. GSCA is core funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland which enables the organisation to offer a year-round programme of creative activities benefitting over  people every week, delivered from their community arts centre, Studio . googletag.cmd.push The local group has received Arts Council funding to support the employment of a dance officer to develop their dance classes. Void Gallery’s programme focuses on the collaborative nature of art and its ability to add to artistic discourse through exhibitions, events, discussions and partnerships. Through their commissions they work with a network of arts organisations both nationally and internationally to create specic projects. Liam Hannaway,chair of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, welcomed the latest funding support. “This year’s annual allocation of exchequer and National Lottery funding is largely standstill for most of our key arts organisation,” he said. “In order to mitigate the continuing impact of Covid-, we have already released upfront payments of % of last year’s grant to  applicants. googletag.cmd.push “This offers an element of stability to many amidst current programming and strategic uncertainty, as the sector prepares to reopen. Commenting on the department’s funding allocation to ACNI, Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey,said, said such support was an important part of the foundations on which the work of our vital arts and creative sector is built. “These awards come at a point where the Executive has agreed a series of important relaxations that will make a real dference for participation in the arts and with the Culture, Arts and Heritage Recovery Taskforce beginning its work. “Taken together these represent an important contribution to supporting the peopleand organisations who work across the arts to be able to do their important work.     “I recognise the pressure that continues to be felt financially, creatively and at a personal level across the creative community, even as we begin the process of reopening and recovery. “I also recognise that more support will be needed this year and so I was particularly pleased to welcome the Executive’s decision last week to allocate a further round of poundm Covid funding to Arts, Culture and Heritage to support the social recovery.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Theresa said: “Not a day goes by without us thinking of him.” Paddy said: “We are so very grateful for the help we received from Young Lives vs Cancer, the support to Gerard and the whole family was fantastic. “You don’t realise you need that much support when your child is diagnosed with cancer. “Families get even more support now with the addition of the charity’s Homes from Home and free accommodation provided close to the hospital. It is a hidden gem that needs awareness.” googletag.cmd.push In , the family were supported by the charity again when Theresa and Paddy’s granddaughter Bella, aged six, went through cancer treatment too. Paddy said: “Bella had a hard time with the treatment but it was great to have Paul’s House – a slipper walk away from the The Royal Victoria Hospital for Sick Children to stay at whilst she received her treatment. “It would have been a -mile round trip otherwise or a costly stay at a hotel. She is doing great now, she loves Gaelic football and is a bundle of energy. “Young Lives vs Cancer relies on donations and it has been so good as a family to be able to fundraise annually.     “Each year the support has grown, we now have sons and daughters of people that first took part. “Last year we held a virtual concert that raised more than pound, and this year we decided to do a k walk run over bank holiday weekend with a raffle – the top prize being pound. “The raffle will be held at Molly’s Bar Iona House, Spencer Road at pm sharp. “We are fundraising for two charities this year as sadly Molly Moran, a treasured committee member of the Gerard Logue Memorial Fund passed away last year.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular.

The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs. McNerlin finished with figures of  for  from four overs while Campbell finished with  for  from his four overs, completing a -run win for Dundrum.It was a fantastic fight back for Dundrum and Downpatrick will know they let the game get away from them.Dundrum would like to thank Downpatrick Cricket Club for hosting the game with the match ball sponsored by Aiden McCabe from AMC building.Dundrum -Downpatrick  all outT SHIELD.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Despair.jpg","title":"Despair for Down in second defeat  ","story":"DOWN were second best to a Meath side who ran out comfortable winners by a margin of seven points at Armaghrsquos Athletic Grounds on Sunday.Down were forfeiting their home advantage as a result of breaching the GAArsquos Covid- regulations during lockdown and perhaps that, coupled with the torrid weather conditions, attributed to their performance.Paddy Tally signicantly reshuffled his starting line-up following their opening day defeat against Mayo in Castlebar.The Down manager made a total of five changes, with goalkeeper Marc Reid and captain Darren OrsquoHagan the most notable of them all.Meath began the sharper of the two sides, but Down could not fault lady luck as their opponents were reduced to  men following a Eoin Harkey black card.The red and black outfit failed to take advantage of their additional man as Meath began scoring points through Cathal Hickey, Mathew Costello and Andrew Colgan.Corey Quinn did manage to score two points before the quarter for the Mourne county, but he also failed to convert a goal scoring chance which set the tone for the afternoon.The game was not away from Down at this stage as Quinn added to his tally alongside scores from Paul Devlin and Ryan McElroy to trail by only two points at half-time.It was a reverse in roles for the second half, as this time it was Down player Jonny Flynn who was shown the black card, leaving his side down a man.Unlike Down, Meath took full advantage of the extra shirt on the pitch and Cillian OrsquoSullivan buried two goals just before and after the third quarter to put the contest out of sight.Referee Niall Cullen was kept busy with his cards, this time displaying a red to Downrsquos Gerard McGovern to close out a miserable afternoon for Tallyrsquos men.Down now travel to Mullingar this Sunday, where they face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park.Down: M Reid P Fegan, G McGovern, P Murdock, P Laverty, D OrsquoHagan, C Mooney, R McEvoy , J Flynn, J Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , L Kerr, D Guinness, C Quinn , P Devlin .Subs: C Doherty for J Guinness , P Branagan for Mooney , S McConville for Kerr , G Collins for D OrsquoHagan , C Gough for Flynn , C McCrickardfor B OrsquoHagan , D Savage for Quinn Meath: A Colgan , S Lavin, C McGill, C Hickey , E Harkin, S McEntee, D Keogan, B Menton, P Harnan, E Devine , B McMahon , M Costello , J Morris , T OrsquoReilly , C OrsquoSullivan .Subs: R Ryan for Harkin , J Wallace for OrsquoReilly , E Wallacefor Hickey , J Scully for McMahon , J Conlon for Morris , D Campion for OrsquoSullivan , G McCoy for McEntee Referee: Niall Cullen Down -Meath -NFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Dozens.jpg","title":"Dozens walk in memory of Seaforde Special Olympian  ","story":"UPWARDS of  people took part in a charity walk around Castlewellan Lake on Saturday in memory of Seaforde man Glenn McBride, who died  weeks ago.Glennwas a medalled Special Olympics competitor who enjoyed soccer and basketball, playing both to a high standard.He was a popular member of of Down Special Olympics Club in Downpatrick and Shimna Stars Special Olympics Club in Newcastle.Glenn won a soccer gold medal with Team Down at the Area Games in Belfast in  and was a member of the Ulster soccer team at the Ireland Games the following year.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale.
