She denied Amazon searched for places with low local business rates to avoid paying as much tax as competitors.Clayton Hirst, from John Lewis, told the committee that businesses like his face much higher business rates and taxes for employees compared to online-only retailers.Committee chairman Mr Betts made a formal request on the Amazon boss to provide her business rate figures and sales figures.Ms Smith said she would \u0027seek advice\u0027 before handing over the company\u0027s figures.She was questioned after shocking new statistics revealed 93,000 retail jobs have been lost in the past year amid a crunch on the high street.

Clothing chains Primark and Superdry have also warned of weak sales.Clayton Hirst of John Lewis said the retail sector was facing a \u0027perfect storm\u0027 of factors including falling consumer confidence and oversupply of shops, both online and physical.MPs on the Commons housing, communities and local government committee yesterday heard evidence on the future of the high street.The panel\u0027s chairman, Labour MP Clive Betts, suggested to Amazon policy chief Lesley Smith that her firm was \u0027single-handedly killing the high street\u0027.She pointed out that 82 per cent of retail sales are through bricks and mortar stores.And she argued that Amazon helped small firms – many of them with physical outlets – sell through its site.She added: \u0027People want to shop for the same things they always have done, which is price, choice and convenience. \u0027Some of that they are finding online, and that is a great opportunity, but they are also finding a lot of innovation on the high street.\u0027Mr Mulcahy told MPs that technological change was key.\u0027The problem we have here is a 20th century infrastructure in a 21st century world,\u0027 he said.\u0027It just has not adapted fast enough to the fact the internet is the main way people engage with stuff.\u0027Debenhams told the committee that it was looking to close 50 of its 166 British stores over the next three to five years as customers move online.Director of investor relations Katharine Wynne said the company was pushing \u0027click and collect\u0027 services – with changing rooms next to collection points so shoppers can try on things they have bought online and return them immediately if they do not fit.The department store chain recently turned down the offer of a £40million loan from Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct tycoon who owns one of its main competitors, House of Fraser.He is the biggest shareholder in Debenhams and has suggested the two rivals could work together.Last November Asos\u0027s stock market value topped £5billion, putting it ahead of M\u0026ampS. Yesterday it was languishing at just £2.1billion.The company said its problems were not restricted to the UK and conditions in Germany and France were becoming more challenging.

At night she\u0027s been coming into my bed. I\u0027m not surprised — I would be the same. If the house had been empty and they\u0027d come in and stolen a couple of TVs it wouldn\u0027t have mattered. It\u0027s the fact that she was there when someone broke in that\u0027s so scary.\u0027What makes the break-in so astonishing is the sheer audacity of it. Not only did it happen in broad daylight, but there are four CCTV cameras (they weren\u0027t working at the time because the front of the house was being decorated, but the burglars didn\u0027t know that).Yet break-ins like these are becoming more common. The latest figures show that 58 per cent of burglaries occurred when the property was occupied — up from 53 per cent five years ago. At the same time, only one in ten crimes committed in England and Wales ends with anyone being charged.With budgets under pressure many forces no longer routinely investigate crimes such as burglaries, thefts and minor assaults. Which, it is claimed, sends out a message to criminals that they can go about their illicit business with little fear of being brought to book.Earlier this month pensioner Maureen Whale, 77, collapsed as she was on the phone reporting a gang of burglars who were ransacking her home in Barnet, North London, while she was inside. She died the following day.And on Sunday, an elderly wheelchair user died days after being assaulted during a burglary at his home. The 69-year-old man suffered injuries to his face and body following the break-in at his flat in Birmingham on December 10.In some ways Sophie and her mother are among the \u0027lucky\u0027 ones. Northumbria Police found a screwdriver left by the burglars. It has been sent away for DNA analysis while a number of neighbours have also come forward with descriptions, which detectives are probing.But the lasting psychological effect of such an incident cannot be underestimated. Consider the spine-chilling words of a woman whose home in Wolverhampton was broken into in the early hours last year.She was awoken by the sound of breaking glass and stayed hidden as the thief shone a torch into the downstairs room where she and her four-year-old son were asleep. Her daughter, ten, was asleep upstairs.\u0027Every second was fear, panic and shock — I have struggled with flashbacks of the night ever since,\u0027 said the 29-year-old in a witness impact statement delivered to a court last month, ahead of the intruder being sentenced to three years in jail.\u0027When he entered I hid under the covers with my son trying to call the police and praying that I could get help. I heard him go upstairs and into my daughter\u0027s room — this is something that still makes my blood run cold.\u0027My instincts were to chase him upstairs, but I couldn\u0027t as I didn\u0027t know at this stage if the police were on their way. I couldn\u0027t leave my son.\u0027And she added: \u0027Mentally we have been to hell and back.\u0027How do you tell a child they are safe to go to sleep when they know this might not be true?\u0027While in this instance the burglar was traced thanks to DNA left at the scene on a baseball cap, elsewhere victims of crime say police are all too often reluctant to carry out anything but the most superficial enquiries.It was reported last month that Britain\u0027s biggest police force is dismissing about a third of all reported crimes after only one telephone call with the victim.Burglaries, low-level assaults, criminal damage, theft and affray can all be dismissed without being investigated under a policy introduced by the Met Police last year.The danger of this approach, say experts, is that it both sends out the wrong message to criminals and leaves victims feeling abandoned.          Laura Thompson whose daughter Sophie, 14, disturbed two burglars who had broken into her home in Annitsford, NorthumberlandBarbara Oakley, operations manager at Victim Support, says: \u0027You want someone to come along and say: \u0027This is what you\u0027ll do next, this is what we will do next.\u0027\u0027You don\u0027t just want to make a phone call and then be left to tidy up the mess, and with all the fear. I think an officer turning up, taking you seriously, goes a long way with the public. Burglary is seen as one of the most personal crimes, because it is your information or your personal space that has been invaded.\u0027Indeed, according to a survey by alarm company Verisure 17 per cent of burglary victims are so badly affected by the experience they move home.Among them is chef Anthony Mercer, who was living with his sister near Rochdale when his house was broken into last summer. As the pair slept upstairs, a burglar or burglars broke in through a window.The following morning they woke up and came downstairs to discover the television, camera equipment, an Xbox and computer hard-drives worth thousands of pounds had been taken. Also missing was 36-year-old Mr Mercer\u0027s car, a Vauxhall Corsa, into which the gang had loaded up the stolen goods.The following day, police stopped the car, arresting the driver who was also found to be in possession of an imitation Samurai sword. Despite being caught red-handed, Mr Mercer was informed by police that the youth was subsequently dealt with by a youth rehabilitation order.\u0027If he had a weapon then you can only assume he had it when he broke into the house,\u0027 said Mr Mercer. \u0027It\u0027s terrifying. At the end of the day your home is your safe-haven. You presume that you are safe. Not feeling safe in your own house is an horrific thing.\u0027Now if there is any kind of noise, I\u0027m awake, bolt upright in bed, looking out the windows to see what\u0027s going on. You worry — is it happening again? I\u0027ve suffered from sleeplessness, fearfulness, general uneasiness.\u0027 Indeed, Mr Mercer has since moved to a \u0027quieter\u0027 area.As an emergency services worker Lucy Mackcracken knows the financial pressures the police are under. But when her house was burgled at the end of June as she slept upstairs with her husband James and five-year-old daughter Emilia, she expected the family would at least get a visit from police.Intruders had forced open the lock of a downstairs door at the detached property in Birmingham, entering the kitchen and taking the keys for her brand-new A Class Mercedes.The family slept through the raid, only discovering the car had gone the following morningHaving dialled 101 to report the crime, they received a visit from a forensics officer. They were then told that they would also have a visit from police who would investigate the crime. But no one came that day — or any other.\u0027In the end they said they were so busy they couldn\u0027t get to us,\u0027 said Mrs Mackcracken, who works in human resources for the ambulance service and was heavily pregnant at the time of the burglary.\u0027They told us they were going to knock on neighbours\u0027 doors but we didn\u0027t see them do that and none of our neighbours said they have done that. I was really disappointed and felt very vulnerable.\u0027For my daughter to have seen that something bad happened and the police haven\u0027t come to help us, it\u0027s left a bit of a mark in her mind.\u0027Police forces across the country have experienced big cuts in government funding that have led to a fall of more than 20,000 officers over the past eight years.And yet there are concerns that priorities have become distorted — with \u0027core policing\u0027 duties such as investigating burglaries and violent crimes being ignored in the drive to tackle hate crime. An offence becomes classified as a hate crime when the victim considers it to have been driven by hostility against their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity.Since 2013 the number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled to 94,000 last year. Recently, a raft of senior police officers have voiced their concerns. Sara Thornton, who chairs the National Police Chiefs Council, said forces lack the manpower to pursue or even record every issue raised. \u0027I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes,\u0027 she said.          Maureen Whale collapsed as burglars were ransacking her home in LondonShe was backed by Cressida Dick, commissioner of the MetPolice, who backed calls to return to \u0027traditional values\u0027 and priorities.Consider, by way of example, a couple of cases dealt with recently by Thames Valley Police.This is a force which closes investigations without identifying a suspect in seven out of ten household burglaries and reported vehicle thefts. And yet it recently emerged it had spent three years and thousands of pounds on a case involving a 70-year-old woman accused of beeping her horn at a black woman during a disagreement at a petrol station.Despite part-time charity worker Jane Savidge denying she had even known who was at the wheel of the vehicle, she was accused of racial abuse, something she vehemently denies. Yet Thames Valley Police have still recorded what had happened as a racially motivated \u0027hate crime\u0027.Outraged that her version of events has been ignored, and fearing the slur of being branded racist would affect her charitable work, she has been fighting the force for three years to get them to change their records — to no avail.The force\u0027s diligence in that matter does not play well with 57-year-old David Holley, who lives near Bicester in Oxfordshire. In January his £12,000 caravan was stolen from in front of his house in the early hours. Although the criminals didn\u0027t enter his property, knowing they were just outside his front door still frightens David.\u0027I called the police immediately, and told them the thieves had left behind broken locks that could be of interest forensically and that there was CCTV footage of the them coming and going in a car.\u0027But it was almost a week before the first officer visited the scene, and almost three weeks before they checked CCTV and carried out house-to-house enquiries. He says he was told that the delay did not matter because \u0027the number plates would almost certainly be false\u0027.NASA engineer comes up with epic revenge package to catch...A Bronx tale of redemption? \u0027Hollywood loves a good...Share this articleUnsurprisingly, no arrests were made, prompting Mr Holley to complain about the force\u0027s \u0027unwillingness to investigate\u0027.Mr Holley, who works for a private bank, says: \u0027There was no attempt to do anything to recover the property I\u0027d had stolen. I feel very, very badly let down.\u0027 But Thames Valley Police rejected his complaint, and a subsequent appeal.\u0027This does not come down to an unwillingness to investigate, it comes down to the number of resources we as a service have to deploy,\u0027 an officer wrote to Mr Holley. \u0027We can\u0027t investigate every theft and difficult choices have to be made.\u0027Talking of the two cases, a spokesman added: \u0027The way hate incidents are investigated, and the way burglaries are investigated, are clearly very different, but as with all offences, Thames Valley Police has a duty to investigate. The investigation of hate-related crimes and incidents does not have any impact on the investigation of burglaries or any other crimes.\u0027Whether such assurances will deter those intent on spoiling someone else\u0027s Christmas by burgling homes and stealing possessions — whether they\u0027re in the property or not — is another matter."},{"url":null,"title":"Bare faced deceit Corbynista tipped female black PM","story":"Labour whip Fiona Onasanya, 35, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice at the Old Bailey todayAs a Labour whip, Fiona Onasanya was responsible for ensuring the discipline and loyalty of her fellow MPs.So how ironic that what ultimately sealed her fate was a fatal blow delivered by of one of her closest political allies.It was only after her first trial had begun that prosecutors were handed the key piece of evidence that finally nailed the 35-year-old\u0027s lies.Reading details in his local paper, Dr Christian DeFeo, her former aide, realised the speeding offence which put her in the Old Bailey dock had taken place close to his home on a night when she had driven to visit him.Onasanya had denied being behind the wheel of the Nissan Micra when it was clocked at 41mph in a 30mph zone. Instead it was claimed that a Russian man was driving.But in his bombshell evidence Dr DeFeo described how the MP had in fact arrived, alone, in the car, and had spent at least two hours at the property, leaving so late his wife had offered her a bed for the night.He also told the court he had never seen anyone but Onasanya behind the wheel of her Micra and that two mobile phones which police said were in the car at the time of the offence belonged to her and were never out of her sight.While Onasanya would take the stand and try to claim that her former speech writer had got it wrong, no one was in any doubt as to the significance of his intervention – Dr DeFeo included.\u0027It is with the greatest reluctance I have to do this,\u0027 he told the Old Bailey. \u0027But to do otherwise, I cannot. It is legally and morally unacceptable not to.\u0027And therein lies a second irony. Because when it comes to morals, Onasanya has made a great play of hers ever since her election.     Ms Onasanya was accused by prosecutors of telling the court \u0027a dishonest construction put together from top to bottom with lies\u0027          Her conviction was secured after testimony from former aide Christian DeFeo, pictured here with Onasanya          When questioned by police over the speed of her Nissan Micra in this speed camera photograph - and over her confused and confusing written answers to their questions - Onasanya remained completely silentIn interview after interview the qualified solicitor told how her Christian upbringing had moulded her into the person she was, encouraging her to go into law because she wanted to \u0027help people\u0027.\u0027I am motivated in all that I do by my abiding faith in God,\u0027 she said in her maiden speech to Parliament. She ended her address with the words: \u0027I intend to do right.\u0027Thus far that has largely meant showing unswerving loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, whom she gushingly praised as a \u0027visionary\u0027 and the architect of a \u0027new and better way\u0027.Yet what ultimately brought Onasanya down was the old sin behind the demise of so many politicians through the ages – hubris, the arrogance and pride that so often precedes a fall.Accused of a minor motoring offence she decided that, rather than face the rap, she would wriggle out of it, enlisting her brother\u0027s help.\u0027This case may have started as a case about an offence of speeding,\u0027 said David Jeremy QC, prosecuting. \u0027It has become, as a result of the choices made by Miss Onasanya, a case about lying ... lying to avoid prosecution for a breach of the laws that apply, or should apply, to every single one of us whoever you may be. What a shame she did not tell the truth in the beginning.\u0027While not the first politician caught out by lies – the former Lib Dem minister Chris Huhne was jailed in remarkably similar circumstances – what is extraordinary about Onasanya\u0027s case is the trajectory of her rise and fall.          \u0027I am motivated in all that I do by my abiding faith in God,\u0027 the newly-elected MP said in her maiden speech to ParliamentThis was a woman who, until she was elected as MP for Peterborough in June last year, was unheard of in national politics.And yet within months she had been chosen as a Labour whip and was tipping herself to become the UK\u0027s first black woman prime minister.So what is known of her?Her mother Paulina was born in London but met her father, Frank, in Nigeria before they settled in Cambridge, where he played semi-professional football.Onasanya and her younger brother Festus – they are just 16 months apart – were born and grew up in the city, although her parents\u0027 marriage broke up when she was three.When she was injured as a child following a collision with a speeding car, her deeply religious mother took her home and prayed. The MP went to the Netherhall co-ed state school, leaving with 11 GCSEs and four A-levels, \u0027mostly Bs\u0027. After that she decided to study law at the University of Hertfordshire, qualifying as a solicitor in 2015.          Within months of her election win, loyal Corbynite Onasanya had been chosen as a Labour whip and was tipping herself to become the UK\u0027s first black woman prime ministerShe chose commercial property law as it was the least \u0027contentious\u0027, saying other areas, such as the criminal law, didn\u0027t always have a \u0027happy ending\u0027.\u0027I wouldn\u0027t want to send someone innocent to prison, or vice versa try and negotiate terms for someone that maybe should go to prison,\u0027 she observed.Given her current predicament, those are skills that might have come in handy.She claims she entered politics by accident. In 2011 she was with a friend in a pub talking about the London riots when the secretary for the Cambridge Labour Party overheard her and asked her to join them.She did so and in 2013 was elected as a Labour county councillor, before rising to deputy leader of the Labour group on the council. In 2017 she was selected as Labour\u0027s parliamentary candidate for Peterborough.It was a tough seat. The Tory incumbent, Stewart Jackson, had been in situ for 12 years and UKIP did not stand because it wanted to give Eurosceptic Mr Jackson a better chance of winning.Indeed it was only following a recount that at 3am on the morning of June 9 that Onasanya was announced the victor with a majority of just 607 votes. Quite an achievement.And yet, within weeks, the seeds of her downfall would be sown.On July 24, 2017, at 10.03pm a speed camera on the B1167 at Thorney flashed into action, capturing the MP\u0027s speeding car.As automatically happens in such cases, a week later a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) form was sent to Onasanya. It was duly returned naming a Russian man called Aleks Antipow as being behind the wheel. Mr Antipow had previously lived in Chesterton, Cambridge, at a house rented by Onasanya and her brother, the court heard.          In July, Fiona Onasanya and her brother Festus, 33, pictured above, were charged with perverting the course of justice. He pleaded guilty. At her trial she tried to place all the blame for the matter on him, telling the Old Bailey he had \u0027set her up\u0027Initial enquiries by police found that the form contained incorrect details for Mr Antipow. Another letter asking for them to be checked was sent to the MP on September 14.Onasanya replied a week later: \u0027I am not sure how I can be of further assistance. I have supplied the details made known to me as well as the licence information. It is a criminal offence to say I was the driver when I was not.\u0027She would subsequently be forced to admit she had not in fact filled in the original NIP form. Her explanation was as follows. Onasanya claimed that she had left the form for her mother to deal with, believing that because the offence was committed on a Monday she would have been staying in London to attend to her normal Parliamentary duties.The car would have been left in Cambridge, so that her mother, brother or others could drive it.But, she claimed, her assumption about the timing of the speeding offence was wrong: Parliament had in fact gone into summer recess the previous week. That meant she had not been in London on the day in question. An honest mistake of a busy woman, she said. She only realised she had got the wrong date when she was charged by police – a full year after the incident. She had checked her diary and realised her mistake.Onasanya told the court that when she had sought further details about the case back in September 2017, she had been assured by her brother that \u0027it was sorted out\u0027. Apparently satisfied with that explanation, she asked no further questions.She went on to explain this staggering lack of curiosity by claiming that at the time she was very busy in her new job. And she claimed she was \u0027not in a good place\u0027, due to health issues relating to an earlier diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.When the police\u0027s attempts to find Mr Antipow hit a brick wall they once again asked the MP for clarification by email and letter.  Onasanya left the Old Bailey today aware she might face a prison sentence. In 2013 Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Price were both jailed for eight months for a very similar offenceShe claimed that Mr Antipow had filled in the NIP form himself. Inquiries would establish that at the time of the offence he had actually been more than 1,000 miles away at home in Russia.Officers once again set in motion attempts to contact the MP and were eventually able to schedule a voluntary interview for January 2 this year. During dozens of questions at Bedfordshire Police Headquarters, Onasanya remained completely silent.In her defence it was claimed that she had a cold on the day, and she felt \u0027overwhelmed\u0027. In July, Onasanya and her brother were charged with perverting the course of justice. He pleaded guilty.She later claimed in the dock that Festus had \u0027set her up\u0027, that she was unaware of his criminal behaviour and was shocked when she learned what he had done.\u0027I haven\u0027t spoken to him about why he has done this but I need to,\u0027 she told the original trial.It was the prosecution case Festus and his sister had acted together, co-ordinating their lies. Onasanya denied this was the case, blaming her brother alone.But in the end her attempt to save her skin by sacrificing her sibling was undone, in large part, by the last-minute intervention of Dr DeFeo.\u0027The evidence of the DeFeos exposes Ms Onasanya\u0027s story as a dishonest construction put together from top to bottom with lies,\u0027 said the prosecutor.With her career – both political and legal – now in ruins, the maniacally busy life of an MP is probably not something she will have to worry about in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"Almost 500 civil servants paid 151 000 Theresa paid","story":"    The chief executive of High Speed 2, Mark Thurston, (pictured) is leading the way with being paid almost £615,000\u0027This is deliberate... there\u0027s a drone on my airfield\u0027: Hunt...Ryanair sacks ALL pilots and cabin crew in the Netherlands...Share this articleTwelve public servants earned more than twice as much as the PM, most of them in the rail industry. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines takes home £590,000 – the second highest figure on the list. At NHS England 41 bosses earn more than the PM, compared with 34 last year and 27 two years ago.           The high salaries add up to a taxpayer bill of £89million.

My cartoon in the Daily Mail the next day captured the excitement of The Duke’s arrival.After it was published, his agent got in touch, saying that Mr Wayne would like the original cartoon. I asked if I could hand it over personally. ‘OK,’ said the agent. ‘Be at the Connaught hotel at twelve tomorrow.’ My editor thought this was a great photo-opportunity, so he sent a photographer with me.A similar request had been made to the cartoonist of the Evening News, Bernard Cookson, so he with his photographer and I with mine turned up at the Connaught.‘Guys,’ his agent said as we met in the foyer, ‘I have bad news. The Duke has been called to the TV studios so he isn’t able to meet you.’Seeing our disappointment, he said: ‘But the Duke feels so badly about it he wants to buy you lunch. So go up to his apartment and room service will attend to whatever you want.’The idiot! Letting four journalists loose in John Wayne’s apartment? We were in there nearly all afternoon. We ate a sumptuous lunch, washed down with copious amounts of wine. We smoked his cigars and ended up with a brandy or two.I kept expecting John Wayne to appear in the doorway as he had in so many Westerns, and blast us all with his six-guns. So if his former agent is still alive and reading this, I apologise for taking such advantage of his hospitality. Unforgivable!          If you’d told me when I was a young man that this was the kind of adventure I’d enjoy as a Fleet Street cartoonist, I would have taken it with a very large pinch of salt. Back then I was grateful to find any kind of gainful employment at all.Almost exactly 62 years ago, at the age of 20, I was nearing the end of a two-year stint in the Army and wondering what I should do with myself when I became a civilian once more.Although I’d been to art college before my National Service, there didn’t seem to be any job prospects in the offing. But quite honestly, looking back, I can’t remember being overly worried about being out of work.I’ve always embraced the philosophy that ‘something will turn up’ and, as it turned out, I was right. With about a month to go before I was penniless, I received a letter from an old friend telling me her son was starting a cartoon animation company in Henley-on-Thames, and was looking for young artists to train as animators.I applied, got the job and, thanks to the skill, patience and friendship of my new boss, Nick Spargo, took my first steps into the world of cartooning.MAC on... the failed Tory coup  Sonic the Hedgehog fans get prickly after the SEGA video...Share this articleNick turned me from a lazy slob into a hardworking, eager-to-learn slob, and two or three years later I became one of his key animators. I wasn’t earning much money but was enjoying every minute.After a film was completed, there would often be a three or four-week gap while we waited for a new commission, and I used that spare time, sometimes working well into the night, to send gag cartoons off to any newspaper or magazine that carried cartoons.It took four years of bombarding the Press with my humble offerings — and accumulating hundreds of reject slips — before one brave publisher bought a cartoon. At last!I was sent a cheque for eleven pounds and ten shillings — a huge amount of money for one rather bad drawing, considering that at that time I was only earning ten pounds a week as an animator. I decided there and then that this was what I wanted to do: become a newspaper cartoonist.          That meant leaving the animation studio and becoming a freelancer — a step into the unknown. To pay the rent and feed my family, I drew three pages a week for children’s comics. I illustrated articles in various magazines written by scientists, golfers, squash players, joggers, chess masters and any other grey page of print that needed brightening up. I tried my hand at cards for birthdays, weddings, Valentine’s, births and getting well soon. Anything to earn a crust.But my priority was to get known as a gag cartoonist, and I think it was through my work in Punch magazine that I was noticed by the editor of the Daily Sketch (a sister paper of the Daily Mail), who got in touch and asked if I’d like to have a go at being that paper’s social and political cartoonist.It was an offer too good to refuse, and for me a dream come true. That was 50 years ago. Two years later, The Daily Sketch was closed down and absorbed by the Daily Mail. I was one of the lucky ones who moved over to the more popular paper.Despite all that, for me it has been the most remarkable half a century. I still can’t quite believe so many decades have slipped by. It has been a thrilling ride. I have worked, and still do, with some wonderfully gifted journalists who have become friends as well as colleagues. Doors have been unexpectedly opened for me, small privileges granted and excitements provided.I remember drawing a cartoon of the Beatles when they were the most famous band in the world. At the time I enjoyed their music but thought they, like most pop groups, would have a limited time in the limelight, then be forgotten. So I wasn’t overexcited when their agent got in touch to ask for the original drawing.      I sent it to him, then forgot about it. Two weeks later a crate of Glenfiddich whisky arrived at my office, together with the fab four’s Abbey Road LP, signed by each of the Beatles.Among the many other highlights were being asked for a drawing by Frank Sinatra and receiving a signed thank-you letter, being sent theatre tickets by Sir Laurence Olivier and stripping off at a nudist colony to hand over an original.I have also been invited to Downing Street by Margaret Thatcher, awarded ‘Cartoonist of the year’ seven times, written a successful children’s book and, best of all, been presented with an MBE — and had a friendly chat — with Her Majesty The Queen.Regular readers of the Daily Mail will probably know that for many years I have drawn within each cartoon a small sketch of my wife Liz’s face. She is always hidden somewhere in the daily drawing — perhaps in the pattern of a curtain, in a puddle or in the branches of a tree. She has become so popular that I am sent cuttings by readers who have had difficulty finding her, asking me to pinpoint where she is hidden.Sadly, my darling wife passed away in 2017 from motor neurone disease, so in her memory I have continued to include her each day in my cartoon.Dear readers, it has been a wonderful 50 years. Full of challenges, remarkable stories, fun and laughter. So what have I learnt? That older people are much easier to draw: more lines, fewer teeth! Golda Meir, the former Israeli prime minister, was a good example, and Donald Trump was a gift from heaven for cartoonists.David Cameron, with his shiny face, was fairly easy. So, too, were Ted Heath, Harold Wilson with his pipe and Margaret Thatcher with her bouffant hairstyle.          I always struggle with beautiful young women . . . let me rephrase that.

It has two swimming pools, two spas and five restaurants.The voyage will begin at Dover on June 2, and the vessel will sail to D-Day events on the South Coast before heading over to Normandy on the anniversary itself, June 6.The full programme, including events in France, will be announced in the New Year.Bob Gamble, of the Royal British Legion, said: ‘Seventy-five years ago, the largest seaborne invasion force in history set sail for France on a mission to liberate Europe.‘Today we stand in awe of their achievement and salute their bravery and sacrifice.’Veteran Alan King, 95, a tank radio operator with the East Riding Yeomanry, said: ‘I’m looking forward to marking the anniversary with the prospect of travelling on the Legion’s chartered ship.          The 880-passenger cruise ship the Boudicca, owned by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, will ferry 300 veterans and a guest or carer each to the beaches on which they battled in 1944‘It provides me with the opportunity to meet other veterans and also ensure I can visit the grave, as I do every year, of my tank commander who was killed in action. I place my beret on his grave and salute him.’Peter Deer, of Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, which owns Boudicca, said next June’s charter would be ‘poignant and moving’.He added: ‘The voyage will follow the same path as the ships involved on this momentous day, and we hope that Boudicca will provide a comfortable setting in which to retrace those important steps.’Other veterans will be returning to Normandy next year courtesy of the D-Day Revisited scheme, which has been organising pilgrimages for ten years.The Allied invasion of Normandy, known as D-Day, took place on June 6, 1944, and involved more than 80,000 British and Canadian troops alongside US forces.          On June 6 1944 Operation Overload - the land invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe - involved more than 80,000 British, Canadian and Commonwealth troops alongside US forcesThe invasion was the first stage in the liberation of Europe from Nazi occupation, which ultimately led to victory for the Allies in 1945.On the 70th anniversary in 2014, veteran Bernard Jordan, 89, won the hearts of the nation by making his very own Great Escape, slipping out of his East Sussex care home and catching a ferry to Normandy to honour his fallen ‘mates’. Mr Jordan died aged 90 in 2015. Veterans interested in travelling on the cruise liner should contact the Legion for an application form, to be returned by Monday, February 4. Each veteran will be entitled to travel with one guest or carer.A ballot will be held if more applications from eligible veterans are received than the number of available spaces on the ship. "},{"url":null,"title":"David Austin create gorgeous scented roses bloomed again","story":"    David Austin created Charlotte roses that bloom repeatedly, instead of annuallyFew spectacles provide more pleasure than a vase of his roses newly cut and still sparkling with dew in the morning, and few bridal bouquets are complete without a David Austin creation.My garden features seven or eight of his roses and, whenever I am asked to recommend a variety for a garden, I will almost invariably choose one of his.David, who died on Tuesday aged 92, quite simply changed the gardening world. One shouldn\u0027t be shocked when a man of his age passes away, but his loss will reverberate through the horticulture community because he truly was a giant in his field . . . and, certainly, his garden.In one word, he was an innovator. He created a whole new class of rose — and, although to date, the Royal National Rose Society does not recognise them as a separate class, to anyone who knows anything about gardening they are distinctly different: the \u0027English rose\u0027 or \u0027Austin rose\u0027.His stroke of genius was to combine the fragrance and appearance of old varieties, of which there are many hundreds, with the one key trait of modern roses: they are \u0027remontant\u0027 or repeat flowering.Old roses tended to flower just once a year, whereas the newer 20th-century types would produce a burst in May or June and then carry on, throughout the summer and even later. That\u0027s vital because, in a small suburban garden, every plant has to earn its living.But gardeners also want something that smells and looks amazing. David set out to discover the Holy Grail — blooms based on Old Roses, but far more luxurious, even more fragrant and much more sensual. All combined with flowers that go on and on.But I don\u0027t think he was ever quite satisfied, mind you. He never named a variety after himself and his family say there are no plans to do so — for it might imply that his mission to cultivate the perfect rose was complete.Austin developed a passion for plants after stumbling on the magazine Gardens Illustrated in the school library.He started visiting a nursery down the road from his family farm, where it was lupins that first took his interest.          \u0027Few spectacles provide more pleasure than a vase of his roses newly cut and still sparkling with dew in the morning\u0027Gayle King is frustrated with leadership at CBS and execs...Corbyn hauled back to Commons for ‘stupid woman’ jibe at May...Share this articleBut then his sister gave him a book, Old Garden Roses by A. E. Bunyard, for his 21st birthday and he was utterly beguiled by the subject.This was in the Forties, when the vogue for modern, brighter coloured Hybrid Tea roses meant fragrance was disappearing. Austin realised he had the chance on the family farm to combine the beauty and fragrance of his Old Roses with the benefits of modern ones.Only after years of dabbling did he find success. I remember interviewing him on TV and, though he\u0027d been a professional grower for many years, he still referred to himself as \u0027a sort of amateur\u0027. And that\u0027s what he was, in the true sense that he loved what he was doing.What he did was not easy. It required immense patience and vision. When breeding roses, you take the pollen from one flower and introduce it to another. Then you collect the seeds that form in the rose hips in the autumn . . . if you\u0027re lucky.Perhaps you\u0027ll get one or two seedlings with the characteristics you desire, but you probably won\u0027t even get that.You have to try many times, over a long period, to get results. David had the land to plant out hundreds of seedlings, giving himself a wide range from which to choose, and he was blessed with the gift for spotting likely candidates and nurturing them.The one rose most associated with his name is the variety Constance Spry. It was his first, in 1961, and he named it after the famous flower arranger who co-authored The Constance Spry Cookery Book.But, though it was bred by combining a modern rose with an old classic, the Gallic Belle Isis rose, Constance Spry wasn\u0027t a repeat flowerer. The remontant gene is what scientists call \u0027recessive\u0027 and so has to be coaxed out through multiple \u0027back crosses\u0027 — crossing the newly produced rose repeatedly with one of its forebears or roses of similar genetic make-up.Once he cracked that, though, he went on to produce hundreds of varieties. Early successes often had Chaucerian names, such as the Friar, the Prioress and the Canterbury.Some were redolent of English heritage: Bow Bells, Cottage Rose, Glamis Castle, Windrush and Scepter\u0027d Isle.Others paid tribute to people he admired, including Mary Webb, Benjamin Britten, Edward Elgar, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Darcey Bussell and Geoff Hamilton. And some had a sense of mischief: Fisherman\u0027s Friend, Teasing Georgia and Queen Nefertiti.Constance Spry is a beautiful pink rose, almost like a peony, a beautiful cup shape with lots of petals. It fired his imagination so that more experiments gave him some gorgeous reds, such as Gertrude Jekyll (named after another revered gardener).But getting a really good yellow was difficult. Yellow roses tend to be genetically prone to blackspot. Many of his early crosses had to be rejected. His breakthrough was Graham Thomas (named after another great rosarian).But my absolute favourite is A Shropshire Lad. The Lad has the most magnificent full flowers. I\u0027ve got one climbing vigorously around a door. It\u0027s too energetic for that spot, really, but I forgive it because of its wonderful flowers.Constance Spry can also become an enormous sprawling thing, not really suitable for a small garden. So, over the years, David dedicated himself to developing more compact, shorter climbers.Though I cannot pretend I knew him really well, he and I were on first-name terms. When we met at rose shows, we would chat: he was a modest man who generally needed a prompt to get him talking about his life\u0027s work but, once he realised he was with a fellow enthusiast, he was hugely forthcoming.          David, who died on Tuesday aged 92, quite simply changed the gardening worldAbove all, he was generous, both with his knowledge and in his attitude to other giants in the rose world. His blossoms are known as English roses, because David felt that they epitomised the country of his birth and because there has been a long tradition of rose breeding in these islands. The French would say, of course, that in Victorian times they were the masters of roses, which is why many old varieties have French names. But these kings among flowers have been part of our heritage for centuries — we even had a war named after them in the Middle Ages.With David\u0027s son and grandson now running the business at his nurseries near Wolverhampton, the Austin family will continue his tradition. Every garden centre showcases his creations.Even in the most outrageous climates, such as the Saudi Arabian desert, you\u0027ll see an oasis or two of David Austin roses. After all, what every sheikh wants most is a real English garden with roses flowering over and over. That\u0027s what David put within the reach of us all — whether a king with a palace or someone with only a humble cottage garden."},{"url":null,"title":"Business Minister interrupts radio interview compliment journalists LIPSTICK colour","story":"    Business Minister Claire Perry dramatically changes the subject in the middle of the interview          Brexit turns lipstick as Business Minister Claire Perry prefers to talk make-up insteadMs Perry said she had not seen it, but pledged: \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what Emma, I shall go back to the department, I shall find you a draft copy and I shall get it hand delivered over to you, how about that?

Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets. And she suggests subscribing to the newsletters of the websites you’re thinking of using, to keep an eye on their offers. “Buy as soon as you see an offer you like. If you leave it until the last minute, you’re more likely to impulse buy, which may mean breaking your budget.”Check your delivery datesMcCall recommends going for nominated day delivery options whenever possible. This means you can pick a time and day convenient for you, which is particularly helpful during the busy festive season. “You can also arrange for gifts to arrive while your family are out, so it won’t spoil the surprise before Christmas morning.” Check the delivery options available before you buy: electricals specialist AO offers free delivery on all items, including its Christmas gift ideas and stocking fillers, and provides both click and collect and next-day delivery.Be preparedAvoid the stress of unexpected visitors by stockpiling extra gifts, says McCall. “It’s always lovely to see family and friends during the festive season, but it can be quite embarrassing if you receive a gift and have nothing to offer in return.” She recommends keeping a few festive gifts wrapped up with the tags blank, so you can fill them out at a moment’s notice. “Chances are they’ll never even realise it was a last-minute gift.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f38581e10db43d2264a7604a6a5b99732ff81df2/0_84_3208_1925/master/3208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45101e0a85e136bab02013a43c2d9952","title":"quiz are you a festive film fanatic","story":"So, you fancy yourself as a bit of an authority on Christmas cinema … but do you know your Elf from your Snowman?

Should we blame evolution or the advent of 24-hour shopping? The experts explain … With our busy lives, Christmas often seems to creep up on us – but the truth is we all know it’s coming. So why is it that just days before, we find ourselves stationed in an unlikely department store aisle, frozen to the spot in a state of panic over what we’re supposed to be buying? Despite the frequent jolly jingles and festive reminders that December is upon us, many of us still find ourselves among the unprepared each and every year. Why do we do it? We asked the experts to explain …Blame our ancestorsAt a basic level, it could all be down to evolutionary psychology, explains Prof Craig Jackson, head of psychology at Birmingham City University. “Evolutionary psychology looks at our behaviour thousands of years ago, and whether any of those primitive basic behaviours exist today,” he says. “Consumer and crowd psychology – the way we make decisions as shoppers and behave in crowds – is a behaviour that has evolved and helped keep us alive. You’ll see it come into play if there is a scarcity of resources – when stocks of a popular children’s toy or beauty product that everybody is clamouring for run low, for example.” In which case, reckons Jackson, an impulse is triggered in us to “get” that resource. “That’s when we behave irrationally – buying quickly, and often paying more for the security of having that item safely, without really thinking about why we’re doing it, or whether it’s a good idea.” It’s all beginning to make sense.What a gift really meansThere’s also the fact that a gift isn’t just a gift, is it? According to therapist Sally Baker, anxiety over how the gift will be viewed and judged means we find ourselves procrastinating over purchases further. “We’re frozen into inactivity because, in 2018, a gift needs to speak volumes. Current economic uncertainty increases financial stress and we’re also increasingly time-poor, which leaves us panicking over the perfect way to express our love and gratitude towards those around us,” she says. Is it any wonder we’re all leaving it until the last minute?Panic stationsEver thought about the shopping process? It only adds to our panic, explains Jackson. “Present buying at Christmas time means we’re heavily influenced by crowd behaviour, since everybody is shopping at once. That behaviour can be irrational, spontaneous and hard to predict,” he says. “You just have to watch an old-fashioned market trader to realise how effectively crowds can influence behaviour – with a couple of ‘plants’ in the crowd, ‘demand’ suddenly creates mass hysteria, leading to a huge surge in panic buying.” It’s not just IRL shopping either. “Online shopping creates a sense of urgency and panic too,” he says. “You’ll often see reminders of how many minutes you have left before your purchase leaves your basket, or pop-ups telling you how many people are looking at the same product, and how many are in stock.”Timing is crucialAnother reason we’re making bad decisions when it comes to those special gifts is down to when we’re actually making those purchases, says Jackson. “Internet shopping is open 247, which means we’re able to buy items at any point during the day – or night. This undoubtedly makes life more efficient, but it also means many of us are buying when our mind isn’t at its most logical – perhaps at 2am when we’re tired, lonely, upset or feeling irrational (or worse, when we’ve had a drink).”How to nail itSo what’s the answer? If you are planning ahead and are considering a laptop as a present, for example, and are unsure about which model to go for, one of the next-generation designs is a safe bet (see below). These laptops use Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, for increased performance and better battery life.Ultimately, according to Baker, nailing present buying is really about listening to those around us. “Make notes throughout the year – if somebody mentions they love a perfume you’re wearing, jot it down so you don’t forget. Gifts are about really listening to people and showing you’ve considered their feelings – whether it’s a colour they like, or a soundtrack or designer that brings them joy.” And keeping tabs on what your loved ones would appreciate throughout the year means less shopping drama when the festivities do finally arrive. Which means more time for mulled wine and mince pies ...If a next-generation laptop is on your Christmas shopping list, then look out for one of the latest models. They’re thinner, lighter and faster than previous versions, and the models listed below are all available from AO.Acer Swift 5 14” (£999)If you want a laptop that is really portable, the Acer Swift 5 could be the answer – a thin and ultra-lightweight model that is great for taking out and about. The Swift 5 combines an eighth-generation Intel Core i7 processor with Windows 10 OS.Microsoft Surface Pro 6 (£879)If you’re after versatility, then go for the Surface Pro 6. It can transform into three modes, so whether you’re hard at work, or enjoying some downtime watching a film, it has a mode to suit. The multitasking Surface 6 laptop has an eighth-generation Intel Core i5 processor and Windows 10 OS.Asus Zenbook 13” (£1,199)The light Asus Zenbook has great sound quality from its Harman Kardon speakers.

Here’s how to nix itWhen it comes to enjoyable Christmas activities, gift shopping is up there with an 8am meeting the morning after your festive work bash. The problem is that – very much like turkey on its third day – some recipients are tough.Jeff Galak, associate professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, studies gift-giving behaviour, and finds most of us make two key mistakes. First, believing the amount we spend is directly proportionate to how much it will be liked. “Research shows recipients typically don’t care how expensive a gift was,” he says. Second, we go off-list. “Givers think the best gifts are unrequested, spontaneous and novel. In reality, most recipients want what they want.” So, if in doubt, ask. But if you’re met with “I don’t know” (as disappointing a comeback as “No, I don’t have the receipt”), follow this expert-sourced list to win over Christmas’s trickiest customers.Challenge 1: Your boss or clientThe tongue-in-cheek gift you think they’ll see the funny side of? Put it back – unless you like your nut roast with a side of P45. “Beware of getting something that makes the relationship too familiar,” warns Galak, who suggests going traditional and work-related: a nice pen, a monogrammed leather notebook, high-end stationery. “Everyone eats and drinks, so that’s a safe bet, too,” adds Katie Shapley, managing director of The Organisers, a bespoke personal assistant and shopping service.Challenge 2: The person who has everything“My rule is always quality over quantity,” explains Milda Chellingsworth, founder of personal shopping and stylist service Styling for You. An example? If their hobby is cooking, buy them a cookery course. If they have a favourite author, get a signed edition. If you can’t speak to them before they’ve had caffeine, invest in a state-of-the-art coffee machine (see below) – there are bean-to-cup options for every budget. “The worst thing is to buy a load of knick-knacks as they’ll end up dumped in the drawer. I hear time and time again from clients: ‘Oh, it’s so-and-so’s birthday coming up, so I’ll just re-gift that thing I never use.’”Challenge 3: Secret SantaThe £10 budget cap might be easy on the wallet, but for your brain it’s the gift equivalent of an eggnog hangover. “One of the big challenges in workplace gift exchanges is that they are often seen as a competition,” says Galak. Plus, you might not know that person particularly well. “It’s a situation where we feel self-conscious (since everyone knows what everyone gets).” At group present-opening parties, an easy hit is an activity that can be done together, such as photo-booth props or the Donald Trump “fake news” game, where you guess if certain quotes came from him.Challenge 4: The person you’ve bought for a million times before“When I ask male clients for information about their wife, I always hear: ‘She loves handbags,’” says Chellingsworth. “But how many handbags must she already own? Does she really want another one that she hasn’t picked herself? I ask them to tell me something more. And that’s when I hear: ‘Oh yeah, she did mention this new place that she wants to go to.’ That’s perfect. Make gifting an opportunity to spend time together.”Ask what they want. “If this feels taboo, ask a close friend of the recipient – this way you get the benefit of giving the right gift, as well as the benefit of it being a surprise,” advises Galak.Don’t pad a gift out. A US study (Presenter’s Paradox) found that adding a small stocking filler to an expensive gift actually reduced how much the recipient thought someone had spent.Make a list. “Because sales start so early now, you go into a shop, buy loads of stuff and then think: ‘Who can I give this to?’” explains Chellingsworth. “It’s less overwhelming to spend an hour thinking of a present for each person, and then shop.”If you fancy controlling your espresso from your smartphone or prefer to make bean-to-cup coffee, look no further than this selection of De’Longhi machines (check online for the latest prices).De’Longhi PrimadonaFor the coffee aficionado.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:“All human wisdom is contained in these two words: ‘wait’ and ‘hope’”Cheery news from jimitron5000, who is reading Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk:There are deaths (probably murder), heavy snow, melted snow, William Blake, a car with a name, a lot of moustachioed men, an outdoor dentist that uses booze as an anaesthetic and a main character is delightfully eccentric - calling people by qualities she sees in them rather than their name for example, and a whole lot more. All in all, thoroughly enjoyable thus far.Also looking on the bright side of life is Thomas75164 who is reading Thomas Hardy’s Far From The Madding Crowd:I am enjoying the visit to Hardy country again. Such a wonderfully evocative writer with the constant threat of doom lurking.American Tabloid by James Ellroy has given Tom Mooney a good going over:No one but Ellroy could pull this off. This is a takedown of the Kennedys. Of Jack and Bobby, and Joe too. An expose of the lurid collusion between the mob, the CIA, the FBI, the teamsters and the government. It’s 10 books of plot rammed into 600 frantic, bloody, filthy pages.It’s genius. But now I’m worn out and tired. I feel like I got a shakedown from Pete Bondurant. Until next time, Mr Ellroy.Reading A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution from 1891-1924 by Orlando Figes has been an “effort” for greenmill, but “worth it”:I now feel that I have a reasonable purchase both on the events and the historical context in which they occurred. The book, although not a recent publication, also goes some way to explaining how Russia got to be the way it is in 2018. Highly recommended.The Soviet state has also been occupying rgilyead, who has just finished Serhii Plotsky’s Chernobyl:A serious historian’s view of what lead up to, and what followed from, the nuclear power station catastrophe. What is clear is that the instinctive secrecy of the Soviet state not only contributed to the causes of the disaster but also alienated the people of Ukraine and Belarus who were worst affected. This had a direct bearing on the rise of nationalistic political movements and the break up of the Soviet Union. The book may have a serious subject but the writing style is easy to read and rather compelling.“Another rather splendid work”, The Great American Novel by Philip Roth, has impressed julian6:An exuberant ode to baseball - a pastime with mythic status in the States. As a dabbler in softball - baseball’s gentler handmaiden - I do have quite a close rapport with this. With a joking nod to Moby Dick, Roth presents a gallery of absurd narratives about an impossibly strange and inept baseball team - the Ruppert Mundys. A wild satire and a wild ride, Roth’s liberating transgressive brio is a stunning tonic for our pinch-faced times.Finally, ChronicExpat has a good tip for reading beside the fire this Christmas:A couple of days ago I read Dickens’s The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton. This is actually an excerpt from The Pickwick Papers but is included as a free-standing short story (13 pages) in the Penguin Classics edition of A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings. It struck me that this might be a brilliant thing for reading aloud – lots of opportunities for funny and scary voices, etc. I have no children, nieces, nephews or grandchildren upon which to test this hypothesis but if you do, it might be one to keep in mind for Christmas ghost story reading.Please report back if you do test it!If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

On race days, up to 4,000 people watched daring racing car drivers pilot the latest advancements in auto engineering, breaking land speed records – or crashing to their deaths trying.After nearly a century hosting sporting events including motorcycle races and Formula One, the Automobil-Verkehrs und Übungsstraße (Automobile Traffic and Practice Road, or Avus) held its last race in 1998, and the concrete grandstands were left to slowly disintegrate.But 20 years later, the cars still zoom by: the racetrack is now part of the 115 autobahn in west Berlin, and for passing motorists the grandstands are a roadside head-turning oddity, fenced off, crumbling and covered in graffiti.“It’s a unique building worldwide,” Djadda says over the roaring traffic, “because you’re so close. Look!” He jabs his arm at a huge truck passing in the near lane. It’s almost near enough to touch. “You cannot just tear it down.”Nearly three years ago, Djadda bought this roadside anomaly – which is now a listed historical building – and with Hamburg architect Christoph Janiesch has devised an ambitious plan to revive the grandstands. Djadda wants to turn the decrepit hall and announcer’s box into a glass-walled event venue and bar overlooking the autobahn. Offices are to be built into the voids beneath, lit by a dozen skylights in the stands. These will double as large vitrines lining the structure’s 240-metre length, and will display vintage automobiles where the crowds once sat, like a high-speed drive-by museum of the history of the car.The finished building will be a motoring spectacle, but the construction of the project itself will be a lesson in ingenuity. Work began earlier this year with the removal of the rotting wooden roof, which Djadda plans to replace in the spring. Due to the grandstands’ proximity to traffic, construction is only allowed during certain short windows and completion is targeted for the racetrack’s centenary in 2021.Christoph Rauhut, director of the Berlin state conservation authority, welcomes the project. “These are difficult buildings to protect,” he says. “What is planned is not so much a massive intervention but really a rediscovery of the original quality of the building.”“It has a high symbolic value,” agrees Richard Vahrenkamp, a logistics expert who has written extensively about German transportation.Although Vahrenkamp is hopeful Djadda’s project will preserve this piece of autobahn history, he remains sceptical about the business model: “There’s so much traffic, it’s not really a nice place for events.”Plenty of people expressed doubts during the two years it took to secure building permits, says Djadda. “People warned me, of course. And some said ‘you’re completely crazy’. I’m not the typical real estate developer.” Born in Iran and raised in Hamburg, Djadda ran a crystal glass business in Thailand for two decades before returning to Germany, where he is involved in businesses ranging from marzipan confections to tin signs. Although he describes the grandstands’ purchase price as “not so much”, Djadda expects the renovation to cost between €5m and €7m (£4.5m-£6.3m).He says the passing traffic is precisely the site’s appeal: the grandstands naturally draw a lot of attention: “I see this much more as a marketing place. Don’t forget, there are 93,000 cars every day driving by.”Conceived in 1913, the Avus was a privately funded effort to support the German automobile industry. Progress stalled by the first world war, but building resumed in 1919 and the first race was held in September 1921. On days without races, it was used as a toll road: wealthy Berliners paid 10 Deutsche Marks for a quick route to their lakeside homes along what is considered to be Europe’s first controlled-access motorway.Vahrenkamp says the road was also used as a testing ground for new materials such as macadam, asphalt and concrete. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, lessons learned on the Avus guided the development of the national freeway network. “It was the example for autobahn planning and design,” Vahrenkamp says. Later integrated into the autobahn system, the Avus went on to host both races and regular vehicle traffic through the 1990s.The racetrack’s observation tower is now a truckstop restaurant.“For some people it is an important, historic place,” says employee Manuela Mattner as she points out black-and-white racing photos plastered on the tabletops. “It’s the first thing you see when you drive into Berlin.”Djadda is betting on the value of that unique location.“Right now, due to the regulations, I cannot put any advertisements here,” he says. “It would distract from the driving. But once you have autonomous cars, then I can put anything I want. Then it’s a huge value. In that world, I would use it for advertisement.”Whether that world materialises any time soon is an open question, but Djadda is confident the project will succeed: “This will be even more monumental, I think, once we have only self-driving cars.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9b636ed63e3199e8a2b0f09deeb8c9c8d47cde/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8ba76b285e045a692e3f1e41088f0a5","title":"1930s politics appeasement un climate accord","story":"Echoes of a horrific decade are getting louder, and the UN climate accord is the equivalent of Chamberlain’s piece of paperMore than any other decade, the 1930s act as a reference point for just how bad things can get. Mass unemployment, totalitarianism, war: a repeat of these horrors is to be avoided at all costs. Eighty years after Neville Chamberlain agreed to Hitler’s demands over the Sudetenland, there is still no greater insult than to dub a politician an “appeaser”.The determination in policy circles to avoid a return to the 30s helps explain why up until now it has never happened. Central banks slashed interest rates and turned on the electronic printing presses a decade ago because they feared a second Great Depression. Welfare states are more generous than they were when John Steinbeck was writing The Grapes of Wrath. Decades of growth have made societies wealthier advances in medical science have made them healthier.That said, the world is currently closer to a return to the 30s than it has ever been. The echoes are loud and getting louder.Let’s start with the obvious. As it did in the period between the two world wars, something has gone seriously wrong with the global economy. The story of the past 20 years has been that of an unsustainable boom followed by a deep recession and the weakest recovery in history.Central banks have applauded themselves for preventing Great Depression 2.0, but what they never admit is that they did so by creating asset bubbles. A prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing – the bond-buying process that boosts the supply of money – led to a speculative frenzy for commodities, shares and property. Those bubbles are now starting to pop. Oil prices are crashing, house prices are flat, shares on Wall Street are on course to have their worst December since 1931.In the 1920s and early 30s, there was a reluctance to give up on a conservative model of political economy: the gold standard, balanced budgets, a limited role for government and a belief that markets would deliver the best of all possible outcomes if left unhindered. Eventually, stark evidence of failure forced a rethink. Starting with Britain, countries came off the gold standard. Franklin Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. John Maynard Keynes explained why it was possible for unemployment to remain high. The economic problems of the 20s had prevented the full flowering of the technologies that appeared in the first few decades of the 20th century. It required a paradigm shift to full employment, capital controls and a fairer ision of the spoils for that to happen.No such reassessment has taken place since the global economy’s near-death experience of a decade ago. Governments are supposed to balance their budgets, money is free to go where it will, the banking system remains largely untouched, and the imbalance of power between capital and labour remains unaddressed. Growth has only been possible because of a buildup of debt. This proved unsustainable in the past and will do so again.To make matters worse, the distribution of income and wealth has mirrored that of the period between the wars. Real wages – adjusted for inflation – have barely risen for those on low and middle incomes such growth as there has been has been snaffled by the better off. If you own a home or own shares, the past decade has been good for you. If you are in a low-wage job with only modest savings, life has not been nearly so comfortable.All these factors – economic underperformance, the return to business as usual and the sense that we are not all in this together – have given rise to a different sort of politics: nationalistic, populist and angry. People in the 30s were susceptible to the cult of the strongman leader because parties of the centre-left and centre-right seemed impotent in the face of a financial crisis, triggered by the Wall Street crash. Now that cult – Putin in Russia Modi in India Erdoğan in Turkey Trump in the US Bolsonaro in Brazil – is back and for the same reason. Voters are no longer convinced that mainstream politics can deliver.Protectionism is back, and, although Trump’s trade war with China is so far more of a trade skirmish, the direction of travel is clear. “America first” is the modern-day equivalent of US isolationism in the 20s and 30s. Governments that pledge to look after their own – through tariffs or immigration controls – have tapped into a genuine sense of unease about how the fruits of globalisation have been vied up.The 40s and 50s saw the creation of a network of multilateral organisations designed to prevent a return to the beggar-thy-neighbour world of the 30s and to embed the new social democratic order. These institutions – the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (conceived in the 1940s but created decades later) and the European Union – have all to a greater or lesser extent been captured by neoliberal ideology and by big business interests. Faith in international cooperation has frayed.One seeming difference between the 2010s and the 1930s is the absence of an ideological clash. During the Great Depression, there were plenty of people in the west who saw Stalin’s five-year plans as a credible alternative to free-market capitalism. That struggle ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the spread of the market to parts of the world where it had previously been off limits.In fact, there is a challenge to free-market capitalism and it is coming from environmentalism. On the one hand, there is an ideology that prioritises growth on the other a belief system that sees the obsession with growth as an existential threat to the planet.Britain’s fixation with Brexit means it is easy to portray Theresa May as Chamberlain and to see the prime minister’s recent abortive trip to the EU summit as her Munich. This, though, misses the bigger picture. Brexit is not the most important issue facing the world it is not even the most important issue facing Britain.Governments are aware of the risk posed by climate change. They know that they need to change the way their economies are run in order to hit targets for capping carbon emissions. They understand that time is not on their side. Yet at the UN summit in Poland they came up with an agreement they knew was inadequate to meet the challenge.Katowice was the real Munich and the feeble UN accord the equivalent of the piece of paper Chamberlain brought back home with him from his meeting with Hitler. Appeasement doesn’t work and merely delays necessary policy action. That was true in the late 30s and it is true again today. Ultimately, policymakers have a choice. They can put their economies on an environmental war footing or they can continue to bottle it. In the 30s, they acted in time, but only just. For today’s appeasers, the moment of truth is nigh.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":null,"title":"a year of dispatches from the frayed edges of britains safety net","story":"I paid a second visit to three of the people I met while I was writing the Hardworking Britain seriesOver the year, this column has told the personal stories of people behind politics – from young families struggling to get by under universal credit to disabled people having their social care cut. Each of the stories spoke not only of their lives but something altogether bigger: what is happening to Britain’s safety net. This month, I returned to visit three of them.When I first met Edith, she had 24 hours before things would fall apart. The 30-year-old has multiple sclerosis, and relies on council-funded care assistants to support her in her two-bedroom adapted flat in Hitchin, Hertfordshire.For 18 months, this small social care package enabled her to live a normal life: one visit at 7am, to help her to get up for work as a chartered accountant, and another at 8.30pm to help her get out of her wheelchair and back into bed. But last February, her care agency told her it would be ceasing its contract owing to staff shortages in the area. Three months later, barely a day before her carers were set to leave, the council hadn’t found her a replacement. Increasingly desperate, and with no new care team in sight, Edith was told she would have to leave her own flat and move into a residential home.Edith’s story shone a light on the darkest sides of the social care crisis: one where a combination of cash-strapped councils and outsourcing is leaving disabled people with such threadbare care that some are threatened with being “warehoused” – moved from their family home and forced into residential care often designed for the elderly.After the ’s article, Edith’s story was featured on the BBC Victoria Derbyshire show and in her local paper. In the meantime, her care agency gave her a week’s extension. With three days left, a social worker called Edith with the news that a care provider had been found.It was a reprieve – Edith could stay in her own home – but the strain has taken its toll. Stress plays havoc with her MS and Edith became increasingly fatigued and weak, to the extent that she struggled to be able to move herself. Her disability has always meant that she occasionally falls, but by summer it was happening every other day: she would drop something, reach to pick it up and be so weak that she’d fall out her wheelchair. “I had to call my neighbours to come in and help me off the floor,” she says.This Christmas, she jokes that she’s going to hibernate – a few weeks in her pyjamas, working on physiotherapy to rebuild her strength. At the back of her mind, she admits that she’s worried about how precarious her care situation is. “I’m certain that without the media pressure involved in my case it wouldn’t have been resolved like it was,” she says. “I don’t know what I’d do if it happened again.”In a year in which the failings of Britain’s benefits system accelerated, few stories summed up the realities more than Jaki’s. The 36-year-old – who uses a scooter due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and fibromyalgia – was summoned for a “fit for work” test in May 2017 at her local assessment centre in Colchester. But when she got there, she found herself staring up at the building: the entrance had a 5in step and no ramp. Unable to physically get into the building, Jaki was promptly found fit for work “in her absence” and, just like that, her benefits were stopped.I spoke to Jaki in May this year, almost a year after she last received her disability benefits. She was malnourished, battling bailiffs and recovering from a suicide attempt.That story sparked a deluge of emails and tweets from disabled people similarly sent to inaccessible benefit centres, and Jaki’s case was featured on Channel 4 and Channel 5. A month after the ’s story, the department for work and pensions installed a ramp at the Colchester centre. A spokeswoman said this week that more work was under way to make “further permanent solutions to access problems”. For Jaki, though, this is now about more than a simple ramp: with the help of a pro bono solicitor, she’s appealing against her benefit rejection on the grounds that inaccessible benefit centres may breach the Equality Act 2010.While she tries to regain her benefits, Jaki faces other battles. She has recently moved back into her home after being wrongfully evicted, and is in the middle of trying to get social care from her council. “I’m tired of fighting everyone and everything,” she says. “You can’t juggle that many balls in the air when you’re ill.”Since the cuts came in, Ruth has slept on plastic sheets. A spinal cord injury means she’s doubly incontinent. One of her lower legs has been amputated, she has osteoporosis and leans on two crutches to walk. Social care was always her saving grace – a care worker to help her wash and do the laundry after an accident, or to help her go to visit friends – but as cash-strapped councils cut care packages, by 2016 Ruth was left with barely any help: a “15-minute pop-in” slot in the morning and at night.Without a care assistant to help with her incontinence, if Ruth had an accident at night, she had no way to clean herself or change her bedding. It meant that for years Ruth slept only on incontinence sheets and a blanket. She had no support to leave the house and, besides, she was too self-conscious to go out. “Because I’m not clean, I don’t want to see anyone,” she told me.When I first met Ruth in the summer, the government had just delayed its long promised paper on the future of social care. As we caught up this week, the paper had just been kicked into the long grass again with MPs warning that Brexit was forcing vital domestic business off the government’s agenda. Ruth is in many ways the human casualty of this political climate, in which disabled people are forced to sleep on soiled sheets and ministers are apparently too busy to give it a spare thought.After I contacted Ruth’s council (kept anonymous here to protect Ruth’s privacy) in July, it agreed to reassess her care package. Within weeks, Ruth was awarded extra hours, from weekly support with housework to a daily 6am call to help her with her washing. It’s brought her a piece of dignity: Ruth can finally sleep on bedsheets again, knowing that someone will be there to change them in the morning.Things aren’t perfect – outsourcing means that she’s got more than a dozen different care workers from three different agencies – but she’s been given funding to search for a PA instead one person she can trust and will provide all her care. When Ruth gets her PA, her council will pay for 14 extra hours a week to help her leave the house. It will make a huge difference. When we speak this week, Ruth hasn’t been outside in a month and it’s taking its toll on her mental health. “When I can’t leave the house, I still see the world carry on outside my window. I feel detached from this world, to the point that whatever happened to me wouldn’t have any impact,” she tells me.It should not take the weight of a national newspaper for someone to be given the social care they need. But for the first time since the cuts came in, what Ruth now has is hope for something better.“This has given me a chance of life,” she says. “For that I will always be grateful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cdb6126c515a18d20ac262b54f926bb33ad9459/0_0_3845_2307/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15c486d6679b5266574475d51ad54d5e","title":"grade inflation universities exams top degrees","story":"You can see why universities would claim that’s just because their teaching has got so much better, and some have said exactly that. But there are a few reasons why this is extremely unlikely. There’s a big difference between the school system, in which qualifications are set and marked by independent exam boards that are responsible for maintaining equivalent standards from year to year, and universities, which award their own degrees.They’re essentially marking their own homework: this is particularly true because several university league tables include the proportion of firsts awarded – the more firsts you hand out, the more you rise up the tables. And there are very few checks on grade inflation. The external examiner system – whereby academics from other universities are supposed to act as peer reviewers – is very weak. Research has found some don’t even see their role as being to assure standards, and when they do, they come to very different judgments. The proof is in the pudding: no one could seriously claim a first from London politan University is equivalent to a first from the London School of Economics.Recent reforms have further increased the incentives for universities to inflate their degree classes. Conservative university ministers have introduced more competition into the system since 2010, culminating in the abolition of student number controls in 2015. Before this, each university was limited in the number of students it could take now they can recruit as many as they want. This has had all sorts of unintended consequences: universities spending furiously on big capital projects such as swanky new buildings the increase in unconditional offers as universities scrabble to get more students through the door so they get the fees to keep said capital projects afloat. But it also means league table position – and thus the number of firsts and 2:1s awarded – has never been so important, to a university’s financial stability as well as its reputation.This has created a mess of a system. Prospective students and employers have to rely on a university’s academic reputation as a rule of thumb for degree quality, which is often based far more on history and research capability than the skills its teaching develops in undergraduates. This is particularly important given the questions – rightly – being asked about value for money in the university system.There are ways to fix this, but it’s pretty much guaranteed universities will hate them all as an encroachment on their autonomy. The lightest-touch way would be to have a more robust peer review system, run by the Office for Students, that is charged with ensuring a first from one university really is equivalent to a first from another. Think firsts to fifths, or even sevenths.Or you could go the whole hog and introduce university examination boards that are responsible for setting assessment right across the system – although universities would say that would compromise their independence to set their own course content. Or we could introduce standardised testing for a sample of students from each department at each university as a way of benchmarking standards and degree classifications.Or an even more radical way to blow the system open – and it would be very hard for universities to argue this compromises their independence – would just be to say that all universities have to open up their exams and assessment to anyone who wants to take them, for a reasonable fee to cover costs. So if you wanted, you could study history at Oxford Brookes but take the exams for a history degree from the University of Oxford. It’s hard to see the Russell Group members going along with this. But if they’re so sure their teaching is a league above the rest, why not? Maybe they’ve got something to fear.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and deputy opinion editor at the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd53c10bef285e6bb2cc671756a2b6c8669feffc/0_44_3753_2252/master/3753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cd17f6594747816f3fff9f5d03521f1","title":"keith richards christmas rolling stones boozing","story":"Keith (“two livers”) Richards, save for the odd beer, has stopped drinking. “It’s been about a year now,” he was reported as saying. “I pulled the plug on it. I got fed up with it.”I imagine the new situation will have caused alarm in some quarters. Surely there will be job losses as a result of this – in some distilleries, or among Keith’s domestic staff, because he must have had a drinks mixer and fixer: a person who knew the precise ratio of orangeade to vodka involved in Keith’s trademark cocktail (“nuclear waste”, it was called). Or what about the comedians who found a ready source of material in his dissolution? I like this, by Bill Hicks: “Keith went over the edge years ago, but when everyone looked down over the edge they saw there was a fucking ledge, and Keith had landed on it.”The announcement certainly disturbed me, coming as it did at the start of the Christmas drinking season. I think about Keith a lot, and now – as I broach my third glass of wine of a festive evening – I will be haunted by chastening images of him doing things other than drinking: Keith carefully and protractedly tuning his guitar Keith going for a walk Keith drinking orangeade laced with orangeade.The trouble is, Keith was always one of my models of insobriety. These people tend to be celebrities who consume a lot of booze with apparent enjoyment and impunity. Ideally they will be old and alive, but it is acceptable for them to be dead if they reached an advanced age, which is why Winston Churchill and the painter Francis Bacon both qualify. Ideally, they should also look good on it, and I think Keith does look really good. He also looks really bad, of course, and one writer put it nicely when he said he wouldn’t mind looking as “goodbad” as Keith.These role models should be graceful drinkers, and again Keith makes the grade. Yes, he tends to slur. For example, a journalist reported a few years ago that Keith took an inordinately long time to say the words “gymnastics teacher” (and I ought to check any further possible agitation by saying that Keith had not himself taken up gymnastics but was referring to the profession of Mick’s dad). And he does have a track record of falling. On stage in Indianapolis in 2015, Keith simply fell over, but he has also fallen off something (a ladder in his library in 1998) and out of something (a palm tree in Fiji in 2006, resulting in a blood clot in the brain).Whether alcohol was involved in any of these incidents I couldn’t say, but when I think of Keith I always do imagine him drinking, and in this way I would somehow commune with him at the Christmas parties of my youth. As the Stones songs blared, I would be drinking and smoking, secure in the knowledge that the co-creator of the party’s soundtrack would almost certainly be indulging in the same way at the same time.I do think of Keith as a Christmassy figure, since he is – or was – the ultimate good-time guy – and Christmas is the ultimate good-time time. I think the association goes back to Christmas 1978, when I bought Keith’s debut solo single, an amazingly loose-limbed cover of the Chuck Berry hit Run Rudolph Run (and I was indignant at Ian Dury’s four-word dismissal of it on Radio 1’s Roundtable review show: “Leave it out, Keith”.)What bothers me today is the thought that if I was metaphorically drinking “with” Keith at those Christmas parties in the late 70s, I wouldn’t have been drinking with him the rest of the time. I was a party drinker, but not the regular drinker I became. If invited to a bring-a-bottle party in my late teens, I always had to go out and buy the bottle specially from that relatively unfamiliar place, the local off licence, which I recall as being bedecked with tinsel – because Christmas was almost the only time I went there. These days, however, if I’m invited to a party I just reach into the fridge for a spare bottle of white.Part of my affection for those Stonesy parties is that they happened at a time of relative innocence, but it was a dangerous innocence. I had no conception of a “unit” of alcohol, but if I’d paid attention, I would have learned in 1979 that, as a man, the government was advising me not to exceed 56 units per week, as opposed to 14 today. We Britons drank less in the 1970s, but the curve was beginning its rise towards “peak alcohol”, achieved in 2004 on the back of cheap supermarket supplies and the boom in wine drinking at home. Since then, our consumption has been falling. Well, I say “our” … Mine hasn’t been falling to any great degree, and I find myself in the mould of the classic modern tippler: a male baby boomer with some spare cash.We fancy ourselves sufficiently worldly to be sceptical about government limits, and I have always regarded the alcohol Jeremiahs, by whom we are now besieged, as authoritarians, physical cowards or prigs. But Keith Richards is none of those things. I pay attention to Keith, as do many of my cohort. He tends to be right about things: for example Led Zeppelin (“If you can’t do it with one drum kit, you certainly won’t be able to do it with two”.)Not that Keith is making any proscriptive statement about alcohol. He just does things his own way, and a lot of men tend to emulate him. His abstinence might actually prove a turning point for me … eventually. In the meantime, I will feel a little lonelier and less resolute as I uncork the Christmas bottles.• Andrew Martin is a novelist.

Some other things could have been better over the years, sure – three little fat kids, single-parent family topped up by family credit in a crappy town, etc – but we’ve been lucky with Christmas.Mostly. Apart from the year we argued so much my brother head-butted a board game through the Christmas tree. And Christmas 2012.Christmas is for wishing, and wishing is what we were good at. Pretending, too. Growing up financially uncomfortable gives you this little ache at the back of your throat that flares whenever you see something that reminds you how precarious stability is. It’s an adult awareness that comes too soon. Other children seem so alien when they beg, cry and whine at their parents for more – more things, better things why can’t they have them, why aren’t things fair? In comparison, you become quieter, older you don’t yell about things not being fair. And everything good is special, because there’s that little frightening knowledge you’ve got. But you grow up, and you get selfish – you want so much, you do stupid things to get it.We booked a family Christmas holiday to New York, in a 4.5-star hotel filled with pine trees and red velvet ribbon. None of us could really afford it – I took a loan out to pay for my part.We told each other it would be the best ever, because we weren’t the poor family who scrimped to get our school uniforms any more. We could be the McCallisters and spend $122.50 on pizza if we wanted.Straight away, something wasn’t right with our Christmas dream. The tour company got the booking wrong – suddenly it was double the price we’d agreed to. We all separately decided not to think about it, and packed. The driver we booked to take us to Heathrow politely ignored us lining up outside his van and counting heads we ran through the airport when we were two hours early. We got ready to talk about feeling “like a heel” for leaving the kids sitting back in coach, too (we were all sitting in “coach”) … but mum had a panic attack on seeing our seats for the flight and started crying.The queue through airport security at the other end took hours, as though New York had heard how annoying we were at Heathrow and didn’t want to let us through (understandable). When we got to the hotel, our rooms were tiny – we just didn’t quite fit.A low-level anxiety started humming through our giddiness. On an excursion to a bargain shopping village, my mum got sad about how we grew up and sat on a bench to cry. I slipped on a puddle of piss in the toilets there and took a header straight into it. An outing to Inside Park restaurant to eat potato and truffle oil confused our Findus-Crispy-Pancake-palates so badly we left feeling like frauds. Mum had two more panic attacks at the Planetarium and at the Museum of Modern Art. For Christmas Day, we decided to go and see The Hobbit, but the taxi driver dropped us off in the wrong part of town and drove away. We argued, we made up, we exchanged gifts in our tiny cramped room and danced to tinny Christmas music played through a mobile phone.Eating McDonald’s we’d snuck through the fancy hotel lobby on the first night is my mum’s favourite memory of the whole trip. But that’s a Boyd pastime, not a McCallister one. Turns out we aren’t really $122.50-pizza people, or expensive-holidays-away people either.New York at Christmas said goodbye to us with the gift of stomach problems on the flight home, in the car home, and the key breaking in the lock as soon as we got home. But it also gave us the important lesson that being yourself in your crappy town over the festive season is way better than trying to be cut-price McCallisters.

The public body’s chief executive, Duncan Wilson, said listing was an important tool in preserving and celebrating the country’s heritage.“We encourage people to understand and enjoy the wonderful range of historic places on their own doorsteps and by listing them we are protecting them for future generations,” he said.The newly listed railway station is Otterington, near Northallerton, on the east coast main line. However, trains would have to be going particularly slowly for passengers to even notice it – most whizz by at more than 100mph.The station building and its signal box were built by the London and North Eastern Railway company in 1932 to replace the Victorian station that had been cleared to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks.The station was not required for long, closing to passengers in 1958 and goods trains in 1964. It survived thanks to sympathetic private ownership, and has now been awarded a grade II listing. Historic England noted the building’s 1930s streamlined aesthetic, which was used “to promote a sense of modernity and speed”.Anyone who has passed through Sutton in south London may be familiar with the big cockerel at the top of the high street. The structure, which resembles a pub sign, dates from about 1907.The Cock Hotel, which it represented, was demolished and the now grade II-listed cockerel sits with road signs directing drivers to Cheam and Croydon. A thatched bus shelter in the Dorset village of Osmington, which has received a grade II listing, doubles as a memorial. It was built in the late 1940s by Harry and Ethel Parry-Jones in memory of their son David, a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, who died aged 20 in the battle of Normandy.Historic England said the bus shelter had not been significantly altered since it was built, adding: “It demonstrates that even modest and functional structures can form eloquent and valuable memorials for their local communities.”The newly listed trough, in Hampstead, north-west London, was built in about 1916 and the structure, which provided water for cattle, horses and dogs, serves as a reminder of the once common presence of farm animals in the capital.Other places of interest identified by Historic England include a former lifeboat house in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex sculptures of Robin Hood and his merry men, which were commissioned in 1949 for the outskirts of Nottingham Castle the Florence iron mine in west Cumbria, one of the best-surviving sites of its type and two hangars in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, used by Rolls-Royce to test aircraft in the 30s and 40s.The new listings and upgrades include 638 war memorials, 19 scheduled monuments, eight parks and gardens and a battlefield."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce130e2d14d9cbc88b5af98088832acba170c1c3/2793_1455_8600_5162/master/8600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c52b09b85894c247eef9722dda3e7a81","title":"uk buildings gaining listed status in pictures","story":"A prehistoric settlement, hangar buildings and a series of Robin Hood sculptures are among the more unusual heritage places gaining listed status this year.

They need their education system to keep upUniversities determine the future: they shape it through their research and prepare students for tomorrow’s jobs. But in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, it’s hard to know what the future will look like. Technological changes such as automation and artificial intelligence are expected to transform the employment landscape. The question is: will our education system keep up?University leaders would be “foolish” not to pay attention, says Lancaster University vice-chancellor Mark E Smith. “We look at the trends in the job market and the skills employers are looking for, and we listen to what employers are saying. We don’t want to be talking about yesterday’s problem.” This is one of the reasons the university is a partner in the National Institute of Coding. The programme, led by the University of Bath, is bringing 25 universities together with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and global companies including IBM, Cisco, BT and Microsoft to create “the next generation of digital specialists”.It’s not before time: a 2017 survey found that half of the UK’s digital tech businesses are struggling with a shortage of highly skilled employees. Meanwhile, a recent government report on the growing artificial intelligence industry recommended that an industry-funded masters’ programme be created to meet the needs for “a larger workforce with deep AI expertise”.But being prepared for the future is about more than just technical know-how. A report from Pearson on employment in the year 2030 found that there is a need for skills such as judgment, decision-making, and analysis and evaluation of systems.Jordan Morrow, chair of the Data Literacy Project advisory board and global head of data literacy at US-based analytics firm Qlik, thinks that in a climate of uncertainty, universities should focus on developing the thing they have specialised in for centuries: critical thinking. “We need people who can give insight, not just observations,” he says. Likewise, he says, the “softer” skills of communication and storytelling are vital. “The reality is that data scientists are trained to do very complex and complicated things with data, but their training is not necessarily in people skills or leadership. It becomes an issue when you have, say, a very intelligent data scientist who has put together an analysis, but doesn’t know how to communicate it.”It’s not just skills that are changing. The Universities UK report predicts a total overhaul of how education is delivered, and warns that the “linear model of education–employment–career will no longer be sufficient”. It will instead require “flexible partnerships” between universities and employers and new course formats.This is something that Lancaster University is experimenting with. A new initiative starting in 2019 and named UA92 (after the FA Youth Cup-winning 1992 Manchester United team) will allow students to study at times that might better suit them than the three-year residential model, Smith explains, and focus on character development, to better prepare learners for the world of work.Many jobs are vulnerable to automation. Knowing how to set up a business will be one way of insuring against unemployment. A recent study found that a quarter of students are running, or planning to run, their own businesses alongside their studies.University of East Anglia is looking to promote entrepreneurialism through its in-house enterprise centre. Several SMEs are based there that also mentor students, according to pro vice-chancellor Sarah Barrow.Maya Pindeus was one of those students. She graduated from Imperial College London in 2017 with a master’s degree in innovation design, and had already established her company, Humanising Autonomy. The startup, created as a prototype with two fellow students during her degree, builds autonomous car software. Pindeus credits her company’s success with the way her education wasn’t shaped by a single discipline – she originally trained as an architect. “This approach should be adopted by institutions worldwide,” she says.

A foreign ministry official confirmed “all options are on the table but nothing formal has been decided yet”.Conservation campaigners welcomed the possible end to whaling in the Southern Ocean but warned that by withdrawing from the IWC, Japan risked becoming a “pirate whaling nation”.“We would like to wholeheartedly celebrate an end to Japan’s whaling in the Southern Ocean, but if Japan leaves the International Whaling Commission and continues killing whales in the north Pacific it will be operating completely outside the bounds of international law,” said Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns at Humane Society International in Australia.“This is the path of a pirate whaling nation, with a troubling disregard for international rule.”Darren Kindleysides, chief executive of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said: “Leaving the IWC would set a very dangerous precedent for other international treaties and conventions. Not satisfied with harpooning whales, it now looks like Japan is threatening to harpoon the future of the IWC.“The IWC has become the driving force for global whale conservation efforts in the 21st century. If Japan is serious about the future of the world’s whales, they would not leave the IWC.”Japan has previously threatened to quit the IWC, arguing that the moratorium was supposed to be a temporary measure and accusing the IWC of abandoning its original purpose – managing the sustainable use of global whale stocks.Japanese officials claim that populations of certain types of whale – such as the minke – have recovered sufficiently to allow the resumption of “sustainable” hunting.At September’s IWC meeting in Florianópolis, Brazil, anti-whaling nations led by Australia, the European Union and the US voted down a Japanese proposal to change the decision-making process – a move that would have made it easier for Japan to secure enough votes to end the commercial whaling ban.The defeat prompted Japan’s IWC commissioner, Joji Morishita, to warn that the country’s differences with anti-whaling nations were “very clear” and that it would plan its “next step”.Japan has been able to use a clause in the IWC moratorium allowing it to conduct “research” hunts every year and to sell whale meat on the open market, although consumption has plummeted in recent decades.Japan faced criticism earlier this year after reporting that its whaling fleet had killed 122 pregnant whales during its annual research hunt in the Southern Ocean last winter. Of the 333 minke whales caught during the four-month expedition, 181 were female – including 53 juveniles.In 2014, the international court of justice ordered Japan to halt its annual hunts in the Southern Ocean after concluding that they were not, as Japanese officials had claimed, conducted for scientific research.But Japan resumed whaling in the region two years later under a revamped programme that included reducing its catch quota by about two-thirds.Japan would join Iceland and Norway in openly defying the ban on commercial whale hunting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77bd584692c8542d22366568d6664d13eb4b53e1/79_290_3347_2008/master/3347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e567e08c9399c20b5b272e1be9989dde","title":"best films 2018 uk phantom thread","story":"Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest, and Daniel Day-Lewis’s swansong, could have been a self-indulgent apologia for tortured male genius – but instead turned its rich observational powers on the trials of new relationships We allow suspension of disbelief for films in genres that would collapse without it, but there’s less room for fantasy in movies about relationships. There’s a reason the romantic comedy has become a dead genre, and it’s not entirely Katherine Heigl’s fault. We can’t help but pick holes in any element of a big-screen courtship that doesn’t ring true. We might forgive some of the more swoon-worthy grand gestures of a story, but we need to believe what we see when we’ve all got at least a modicum of real-world experience with romance.It has become increasingly difficult to break through this barrier, and romcoms have retreated to the small screen, where expansive storytelling makes them feel more fully realised. But this year has thrown forward an unlikely saviour of big-screen romance: writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, whose unusual filmography – from Boogie Nights to There Will Be Blood and The Master – is mostly inhabited by traditionally weighty or opaque work. A clue to his affection for the genre, however, lies in his 2002 film Punch-Drunk Love, which paired a socially inept Adam Sandler with a charming Emily Watson. It was woozily romantic and darkly funny a forefather to his latest – and quite possibly best – film, Phantom Thread.In 1950s London, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) presides over a boutique fashion house, making costly dresses for elite women. He works with his strong-willed sister, Cyril (Lesley Manville), whose power also extends to his romantic life, helping to remove each new love interest once Reynolds inevitably tires of her. But he becomes spellbound by waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps), taking her on as lover and muse, moving her into his apartment and easing her into his life, regardless of fit. When Alma rebels against his strict routine, the pair find themselves in dark, uncharted waters.Released so soon after Darren Aronofsky’s self-indulgent Mother!, red flags were raised by the thought of another story from a tortured male genius about just how difficult it is to be a tortured male genius. But Phantom Thread is a fascinatingly unexpected and wildly subversive treat, a film about far more than initially expected a piercingly sharp study of a relationship that turns into a pitch-black romantic comedy.It is also a remarkably female story, essentially about two women forced to find ways to deal with the brattish immaturity of a man they both love. Day-Lewis has stated this is his last film, and it’s an intriguing swansong. His performance is excellent, but those around him make longer-lasting impressions. The Luxembourg-born Krieps is bewitching as the woman who challenges him, while Manville is sensational as the one who keeps him in check. All three are introduced as types we think we’re familiar with, but by the end we’re floored by what lies beneath, as Anderson gleefully plays with our preconceptions.Despite the gloriously constructed period setting, there is a keenly observed messy pettiness in many of scenes, particularly in a horribly familiar dinner date gone wrong. It’s about the battle between independence and co-dependence we all face in new relationships. Reynolds is a confirmed bachelor who has avoided marriage because it would make him deceitful. With age he has built a fortress, ruled by his likes and dislikes, and when Alma dares to prod at its structure, his instinct is to shut her out. How much compromise should you make when sharing your life with someone else? How dangerous is it to let someone in? How much damage can be done?Phantom Thread will resonate in different ways with people, depending on their relationship status and history. Regardless, it remains a richly, often brutally well-observed wonder, perverse and compelling throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857a48a293994c05d2919fab066924cc32c4c3b3/0_145_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10e19845f3cf64a61e35d9fbc38bd116","title":"steve mcqueen i experience racism every day","story":"The director’s Widows is the ’s eighth best film of the year. He explains why some male white critics didn’t really get itYou first watched Lynda La Plante’s ITV series Widows as a 13-year-old in 1983. Do you think it’s harder for people to overcome stereotypes – as the women in the series and your film do – in Brexit Britain than in Thatcher’s Britain?No. Nothing much has changed at all. I don’t know what has happened but we have taken two steps backwards. Nationalism absolutely has a part to play. The day after Brexit, my mother went to her favourite high-street shop. She had a new credit card with her and was struggling to remember the pin. The guy behind the till said: “It’s four digits in this country.” My daughter was with her at the time and said: “Granny, why didn’t you say anything?” She replied: “When they go low, we go high.” But the day before Brexit you wouldn’t have even thought about saying that. Apparently, you’re allowed to now.Have you personally experienced more racism since Brexit?Every day, mate. Yes, of course! Wolves come in sheep’s clothing. You deal with it. You have to or you go mad. So long as you put one foot in front of the other, you’re good.You’ve spoken about how audiences watching Widows seem to welcome the chance for some catharsis that they seem paralysed in the current political situation. How can they seize agency?We really do have the power. As iniduals we don’t, but as a collective, absolutely we do. We can change the course of events. Sometimes we just need a reminder – and cinema is one of those tools that can actually do that.Do you think Widows is getting the acclaim it deserves?I don’t know. I don’t expect it anyway. If it comes: fantastic. If it doesn’t: whatever. It is what it is.You’ve said you think it might be being misunderstood by some male film critics …It depends if you’re sensitive enough to understand what other people go through, if you’re a male white critic. It’s one of those things that’s kind of obvious to me, maybe not to others.A friend of my wife said to her husband: “Let’s go see Widows.” And he said: ‘Oh, is it only women who are starring in it?” And she said: “It’s got Liam Neeson.” And he said: “Oh, OK, I’ll go then.” So we’re still fighting against nonsense. I mean, how often, as a woman, did you project yourself on to heroes such as John Wayne or Sean Connery? That men struggle to even think about doing that is incredible.Is a lot of the conversation about progress hot air?Look, if I were brought up differently I would think differently. It’s about putting these debates into the mainstream and then being absolutely open and honest. Truth will always prevail – if I didn’t believe that, I wouldn’t be on the phone to you now. And that’s why we need good journalism rather than journalism that’s only for certain people. I went to CNN the other day, I looked around the desk: where were all the black people? If a scientist were trying to carry out a fair and logical experiment, they wouldn’t just use a part of the population. The conclusions would be quasi. You have to take on all possibilities and then come to a conclusion, and that’s the only way we can have a logical debate. How anyone would think we could have that without everything on the table seems impossible – but we do so gladly. Because the people with positions of influence do that.The Hollywood Foreign Press Association – which runs the Golden Globes – completely ignored Widows in its nominations. Does that speak to you of a certain blindness?Well, yes. As an artist you have your path and that’s fine. And sometimes the world won’t agree with you and that’s fine. I’m here hopefully for a little while and will do my work. I’m just telling a story about four women trying to get their shit together, about the environment in which we’re living, in a way that’s not high heels and handbags, that’s about human beings and full-on conversations.Yet I can’t remember if there has ever been a movie about a gay person who is a detective or the lead in a romantic comedy who doesn’t have a problem with their sexuality. How is that possible? Certain people of power and influence in the industry are gay yet would never think about making a movie like that. What does it say about the worldview they’re helping maintain? I’m not pointing fingers – I’m just saying that if we see two men or women walking down the street holding hands, we’re not even gonna blink. But if it’s on the screen, apparently it becomes thunderous.Was the Academy overeager to demonstrate their racial inclusivity by picking Kevin Hart to host – and ignoring his record of homophobia?Well, that’s all to do with popularity and their needing viewing figures. But obviously someone made a mistake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1330f8173418acbb056a75a0d4e3755ed4ad676/15_314_3837_2303/master/3837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcdc1b36cf749923eb6f75b421ce058a","title":"dele alli tottenham carabao cup quarter final arsenal","story":"It is easy to forget that Dele Alli is still only 22, such have been the vicissitudes of a career that has seen him ease through the incredulous highs and lows of two England tournaments and during which his own levels have veered between a performance of rare destructive beauty against Real Madrid and those afternoons when he simply drifts through a game, a sublime attacking talent in search of a hook on which to hang.At the Emirates, Alli provided two moments of brilliance in the heat of an evenly matched knockout derby. He was central to the action again a little later when a spectator on the far side threw a plastic water bottle at his head with Tottenham 2‑0 up, something Alli then reminded that section of the crowd of thanks to some helpful hand gestures.It is to be hoped the supporter responsible is identified and banned from the stadium.For now it is Alli’s second-half goal that will dominate the montage from this game, a finish so delicate it seemed to stop time for a moment, one of those touches that take you out of the fury of elite-level football and back into a place where people play for fun, where the game is a carefree thing full of joy.Alli’s first decisive moment had come earlier, as Tottenham scored an opening goal made by a tumble, a neat finish and two long balls. The second of these was the most gorgeous instant pass from their No 20.Paulo Gazzaniga punted the ball forward from the back. Sokratis Papastathopoulos fell over in a tangle with Lucas Moura. As the ball ran loose the players seemed to stop for half a beat. In that moment Alli saw the picture, the space and the lines of movement around him a bit quicker.A twitch of his right foot sent the loose ball curving into the path of Son Heung-min, already off on the run and calling for it on the far side. The weight and the curve were perfect to take Son spurting in on goal. He pinged the ball powerfully into the far corner past Petr Cech.The worth of an assist has always been a little nebulous in football but this was a genuine goal-conjuring pass, seized out of the air and executed with cold, clear certainty. It was his third of the season in all competitions, but then it has been an in-and-out campaign until now.Alli is a player whose merits are most clear when you see him in the flesh. At times his easy physicality, his use of space, his wonderful touch, can almost feel like a force of intimidation, the kind of footballer opponents seem to stand back and admire in the clinches. It is also fair to say his best moments come when he does not wait for the rest of the game, when he just sees it and plays it, circuits whirring that little bit faster than the average human.For this Carabao Cup quarter-final Alli was stationed at the creative heart of the Spurs team, playing as a floating No 10 behind two strikers. There has been a prolonged attempt to find his ideal position. Here Mauricio Pochettino built a structure that gave him huge freedom but also huge responsibility, the job of making this team work, and justifying Christian Eriksen being shunted to the left.As for Arsenal, well, their own No 10, Mesut Özil, was nowhere to be seen on a big night for his team at the Emirates (insert joke here).On this occasion Özil was left out for “tactical reasons”. Presumably these tactics were to actually try to win the game, something Özil has experienced just once in his last eight weeks at Arsenal, during which time the club have paid him £2.8m under his new contract.Get that atlas out, Mesut. Dust down that suitcase off the top of the old French armoire. Arsenal are nothing if not a commercial machine and this is surely one of the worst pieces of business in the club’s history. January can’t come quickly enough.Other than that, Arsenal will feel unlucky. They might have equalised in the first half. Instead it was left to Alli to kill the game after 59 minutes. What a lovely goal it was, made by Harry Kane taking the ball on his chest and playing a simple pass over the top of Arsenal’s defence, who stood and watched and thought about it while Alli drifted in on goal.Cech came skittering out. Alli raised his right foot and stroked, cosseted, dusted, fondled – and all other manner of delicately sensual verbs – the ball over the goalkeeper’s head, where it seemed to hang in the night air before falling gently into the back of the net.“We’ve got Alli,” the Spurs fans pointed out from behind the goal. Given the chance to provide that edge from the cockpit of the team, he was more than enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbdb995b33dbd4774e6af97196901274f1c2b59d/996_545_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60523b5d1b0269c47fbc7474b76546a5","title":"mike phelan manchester united return","story":"They say 24 hours is a long time in football but, even with his vast experience, Mike Phelan must still be pinching himself about Tuesday’s turn of events. Back in his home town while he takes a break from sporting director duties at the Australian side Central Coast Mariners, the 56-year-old took up an invitation to take a coaching session at Burnley College before answering questions from students about his experiences as Sir Alex Ferguson’s assistant at Manchester United.“One of the students asked him what his dream job would be and he said it would be to be coaching in front of 70,000 people again, so whether he had already had that conversation I don’t know,” says Ash Aldersen, Burnley College’s academy of sport and elite athlete manager. “But it’s a dream come true for him. He said he’d come back from Australia just for Christmas, so I suppose he’s had an early present returning to United.”Born in nearby Nelson, Phelan made almost 150 appearances for Burnley before joining Norwich in 1985. But it was at Old Trafford that he enjoyed his most successful period as a player, helping Ferguson end United’s 26-year wait for the league title in 1993, before returning as a coach six years later. He was promoted to assistant manager in 2008 when Carlos Quieroz left to take over Portugal and won six Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.But after disappointing spells at Norwich as a coach and then Hull, where he was sacked as manager after less than three months, Phelan could have been forgiven for feeling forgotten until he received the call from United asking him to become interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s assistant in the wake of José Mourinho’s departure.“We didn’t get much of an inkling about it either,” admits Aldersen. “But he was really professional in what he said about Manchester United and the ethos Sir Alex Ferguson created at the club. He actually said it was a very similar approach to what we have at Burnley College, which was fantastic. We have a big support network around the students to try to get the best from them. The level of his coaching was outstanding – you can tell it is something he really has a passion for.”With 50 A-Level students who are also academy elite level sportsmen and women, the college has become renowned for its innovative approach to helping aspiring athletes reach their potential through tailored development programmes including nutrition and psychology. The British hammer thrower Charlotte Williams and the Doncaster Rovers goalkeeper Marko Marosi are just two of those to have progressed to the highest level, the latter benefiting from being coached by the former Burnley players Andy Payton and Gerry Harrison.They were also in attendance for Phelan’s masterclass on Tuesday, with United’s new assistant manager – employed in what he has called a “dual role” alongside his job at Central Coast Mariners – outlining some of his coaching philosophies in a special lecture.“My husband has texted me saying, ‘Woah he’s in Burnley College one day and then Manchester United the next’ – but it’s more seeing the students’ reaction to him,” says the principal, Karen Buchanan. “They absolutely loved it.”Phelan was also intrigued by the technology provided for students by the college’s new drone. “We’ve been using that information to show the students their positioning and to give them some tactical pointers,” Aldersen says. “He asked quite a few questions about that and stayed until well into the afternoon. He just wanted more really.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/433e8ce5d2ba13361a416c0570e487b1f75ab71f/35_330_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83d4b477f6ac92773b040a01610b07fe","title":"sheffield wednesday owner dejphon chansiri tells fans club up for sale","story":"Sheffield Wednesday owner Dejphon Chansiri has told fans he is putting the Championship club up for sale.Speaking at a fans’ forum on Wednesday night, Chansiri said he believed there was plenty of interest in the club despite off-field problems which saw the Owls placed under a transfer embargo for much of the summer.“I will put this club on the market and I believe many people will want to buy,” Chansiri said.The Thai businessman bought the club in early 2015 from Milan Mandaric, and the early signs were promising as they finished in the Championship play-off places in his first two full seasons. But they fell short of promotion to the Premier League and could only manage 15th place last season.They sit 18th in the current table with 24 points from 22 games, and fans have begun to turn against coach Jos Luhukay. The transfer embargo, which lasted from April to August, followed breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.The Football League’s FFP rules do not permit clubs to post losses of more than £39m over three years. The latest figures show Wednesday lost over £20m in 2016-17.Chansiri told fans the club still needed to “solve” FFP and he could not make any promises ahead of the January transfer window, but insisted he would remain continue to do his best for the club until a new owner comes in.“We have problems with FFP, so it is hard but we will try our best,” he said. “With January in mind, I cannot answer what we can do right now. The important thing for me is to solve FFP …“One day you will have a new owner but while I am your chairman I will do my very best and never do anything to damage this wonderful club.”"},{"url":null,"title":"the 100 best male footballers in the world 2018 nos 100 71","story":"Our panel of 225 experts from 69 nations compile a list of the greatest male players in 2018.

Never fear – here is our guide to the best new board gamesThis family-friendly game of rival archaeologists sees players racing to explore an ancient Egyptian tomb, uncovering priceless artefacts as they make their way along a twisting underground passage. At first glance it resembles roll-and-move games such as Monopoly or Ludo. But where those traditional family favourites rely heavily on luck, Luxor is more tactical. It uses clever card play to determine how you progress along its subterranean track, emphasising smart decisions rather than chance.As you delve deeper into the tomb you will discover an assortment of treasures that boost your score and gain new, more powerful cards that let you carve out advantages over your opponents. It is an addictive blend of fast and thoughtful gameplay and, while its grave-robbing theme may not be culturally sensitive, it is quick, elegant and accessible – an ideal option for anyone dipping their toes into modern board games for the first time.For many families, a post-turkey game of charades is a Christmas staple, and the festive season would not feel quite complete without watching uncle Fred turning purple with rage while trying to mime “The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe”. This team-based game of clever communication aims to create the same kind of feel, but rather than making you wildly gesticulate, it challenges you to convey messages to your teammates using a vocabulary of just 105 words printed on cards.This turns out to be trickier than you might think. You could end up expressing “Super Mario” as: “Play with red blue jump man,” or “hedgehog” as: “Small brown not fast animal.” With such a small pool of words at your disposal, you will have to be creative to get your meaning across, and if it is difficult for the player coming up with the message, it is just as tough for the other members of their team trying to decipher it.With both sides simultaneously attempting to guess the same word, there is real competitive tension. And if you are playing with kids, the game comes with a selection of difficulty levels, letting you tailor its setup to players of all ages.This deceptively simple game casts players as the leaders of Polynesian tribes vying to explore and settle a cluster of tropical islands. On each turn you will place one of your tribespeople on the board, claiming areas of land and water. The aim is to spread your people as widely as you can across the map, but also to control the islands by having more members of your tribe on them than your opponents. Along the way, you will also boost your score by picking up resources such as bamboo and coconuts.With multiple ways to earn points, you will face some tricky decisions as you try to work out the best ways to place your people. And even once you have come up with a plan, you will need to seize vital sections of the board before your rivals. The result is that, in spite of its sunny artwork and idyllic island theme, Blue Lagoon reveals a brutal competitive streak as you cut your opponents off from the territories they most need.It is enough to spark some intense grudges, and it is impressive just how much antagonism and strategy the game squeezes out of some very straightforward rules.Troll \u0026amp Dragon, a child-friendly game of courageous treasure hunters, sees players sneaking through caverns guarded by ferocious monsters, helping themselves to as much loot as they can carry in the process. Each turn starts by rolling and re-rolling dice in an effort to accumulate diamonds. But each time you do it, you risk attracting the attention of an angry troll, dropping your treasure as you flee.From there you will move on to a dragon’s cave, where things become more heated. Once again you will roll dice, this time aiming to grab precious golden nuggets. But as you do, your opponents will also roll a set of red dragon dice, attempting to wake the slumbering beast and chase you off empty-handed.The result is a fast-paced and frantic scramble. To escape with your ill-gotten goodies you will have to judge when to push your luck and when to turn and run. It takes some quick-thinking analysis of risks and rewards, and watching young players trying to find that balance can be hilarious, making for riotous fun for grown ups as well as kids.The first thing that strikes you about this game of strange contraptions and eccentric engineers is the giant cardboard structure it deposits in the middle of your table. It is a container full of coloured marbles with a chute-like mechanism that lets them slide out as you play, and it looks a bit like something Wile E Coyote might order from the Acme Corporation.Look beyond this physical gimmick, though, and you will find a slick and streamlined game about inventors trying to claim the top prize in a prestigious science fair. You will battle to build machines that impress the judges, harvesting different types of energy – represented by those shiny marbles – and spending it to add new components to your growing creation. You will unlock new abilities, generate extra power and make ever-more dramatic plays as you fight to establish your scientific supremacy.There is a powerful sense of progression as you incrementally augment your machine, and it is deeply satisfying seeing its parts starting to work together. But with players taking just a single action on each of their turns, it never gets bogged down in complexity, and as soon as one game is over, you will be itching to start another.Keyforge: Call of the Archons2 players, 30-45 minutes, from £8.99In 1993, the designer Richard Garfield released Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game that cast players as powerful mages doing battle in a fantasy universe. It became a smash hit, with players building collections of cards and using them to create custom decks, all fine-tuned for different strategies. But it also led to the growth of a secondary market, with powerful cards sometimes changing hands for hundreds of pounds online.Garfield’s latest game aims to side-step this collector mania. Like Magic, Keyforge sees players command armies of beasts and warriors in card-based conflict. But rather than building your own deck, you will buy a pre-constructed one assembled by a computer algorithm.It is a novel approach, and it makes Keyforge much cheaper to get into than other card battlers. But it is also a fascinating game in its own right, with plenty of interesting tactical decisions and clever card combinations to discover. The game goes out of its way to ensure you have something interesting to do on almost every turn, and contests swing back and forth as players deploy their troops, clash in combat and exploit an array of special powers and abilities. It makes for some dramatic and unpredictable moments as the fight for supremacy plays out on your kitchen table.Miniature battle games have a reputation for complexity. But Wildlands, a fantasy skirmish game that sees players command squads of warriors in fast and furious combat, aims to make things quicker, simpler and infinitely more approachable.It hands players command of an assortment of sword fighters, archers and magically-powered automatons, throwing them into a frantic struggle for survival. The aim is to outsmart and overpower your opponents, gaining points for killing off enemy troops and collecting magic crystals scattered around the board.In the process, you will come up with clever plans and react to your rivals’ plays, picking off your foes with well-placed crossbow bolts or charging headlong into hand-to-hand combat. The result is a game full of twists, turns and dramatic moments, where lone soldiers put up heroic last stands against multiple assailants, fleet-footed rogues e out of the path of volleys of arrows, and grizzled sorcerers lob fireballs at one another across darkened corridors.What is most impressive is that Wildlands conjures so much action and drama with so little mechanical clunkiness. Everything in the game revolves around simple sets of symbols on cards, and it combines real tactical depth with pick-up-and-play simplicity. It also comes with four different factions to command, and a double-sided board giving you either a ruined city or a subterranean dungeon to battle over, ensuring your clashes have plenty of variety.Have you played any great games this year?

However, witnesses said her heckling during the serious points being made about the fragility of the institutions of peace created by the Good Friday Agreement was far from humorous and had interrupted a hushed respectful atmosphere in the ballroom of the embassy. Bell is from a village in County Louth near the Republic’s border with Northern Ireland, and has described herself as a former remainer who embraced Brexit because of the European commission’s “contemptible” treatment of Britain since the vote to leave the EU.In an interview with the  on Tuesday, Bell said the ambassador’s mention of a possible second referendum prompted her heckling.“A second referendum would have highly unfortunate consequences for this polarised and still combustible island. It’s not that mandates should never be withdrawn or a referendum reconsidered. If, however, a democratic outcome is to be reconsidered, it must first be respected. What could be more damaging than a second referendum if remain wins as narrowly as it lost the first? We would find ourselves in a precarious state.”She added: “Obviously, I profoundly regret the excessive robustness and perhaps lack of finesse with which I expressed my disagreement with the ambassador. I had, I confess, enjoyed a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat who is a staunch Brexiteer.”Bell said she worked as a customs guard on the Northern Ireland border in 2006 before emigrating and becoming a journalist. She writes mainly about lifestyle, fashion and travel.In an Evening Standard comment piece on dating last year the journalist expressed admiration for the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg. “I wonder if Jacob Rees-Mogg is popular these days because he reminds people of the good old days when men acted like gentlemen and women were treated with respect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/999a0276b2c14b27c6d26b48701659f7c9d990bb/0_81_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3cd7ef759faabbd53952bcc801e575c","title":"jeremy corbyn accused of calling theresa may a stupid woman","story":"Speaker says Labour leader should be taken at his word over alleged remark at PMQsParliament descended into chaos on Wednesday as angry Tory MPs accused Jeremy Corbyn of calling Theresa May a “stupid woman”, which the Labour leader vehemently denied.The Speaker, John Bercow, struggled to maintain order in the aftermath of prime minister’s questions when Corbyn appeared to mutter the phrase to himself. He later said the phrase was “stupid people”.The video of the remark, made after May’s final exchange with the Labour leader, spread like wildfire among Tory MPs even as May continued to answer questions in the House of Commons.As the Tories grew more incensed, several MPs, including the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, accused Bercow himself of using the same term, prompting an angry backlash from the Speaker.The video of the exchange, which Bercow said he had not seen, prompted frenzied speculation on social media, including analysis from unexpected quarters.The deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie was asked by BBC Radio 5 Live to examine the footage and suggested she believed Corbyn had said “stupid woman”. The West Wing actor Rob Lowe, who is deaf in one ear, also tweeted that he believed Corbyn had said “woman”.In an attempt to restore order as dozens of MPs called points of order after PMQs finished, Bercow said he would review the footage.Corbyn later returned to the Commons and insisted he had said “stupid people” after May likened Labour’s unwillingness to call a no-confidence vote to a pantomime, saying: “He’s going to put a confidence vote – oh yes he is, oh no he isn’t.”He said the comment was in response to “those who I believe were trying to turn a debate about a national crisis in this country into pantomime”.In a statement before Corbyn’s return, Bercow said it was easy to see why people believed Corbyn had used the phrase, but he could not be certain and the Labour leader should be taken at his word.The issue brought together MPs from across the Conservative party, including critics of May, such as the remainer Anna Soubry, and the staunch Brexiter Mark Francois, who submitted a no-confidence letter last week.The Conservative vice-chairman Paul Scully raised the matter directly with May during the latter half of PMQs. “This year, when we’ve been celebrating 100 years of women getting the vote, do you think it’s appropriate language to call people a ‘stupid woman’ in this chamber?” he asked.May initially looked confused but then said all MPs “should be aiming to encourage women to come into this chamber, and to stand in this chamber and should therefore use appropriate language in this chamber when they are referring to female members”.While May was still in the house, the former Tory chair Patrick McLoughlin asked Bercow to censure Corbyn.“He muttered words which were quite clearly visible, accusing the prime minister of being a ‘stupid woman’,” he said, as MPs shouted “Shame!” and “Disgrace!”Bercow insisted he had not witnessed the alleged comment, provoking fury from some MPs, several of whom accused the Speaker himself of using intemperate language.Leadsom said the Speaker had not apologised for previously calling her a “stupid woman”. Bercow was reported to the standards watchdog over the alleged comments made in May.“Why it is that when an opposition party member found that you had called me a stupid woman you did not apologise in this chamber?” she said.To loud shouts of, “Apologise!” from Tory MPs, Bercow said: “I dealt with that matter months ago in remarks that I made to the House of Commons … which requires from the chair today no elaboration whatsoever.”Bercow said later he had looked at the footage and consulted professional lip-speakers. “It is easy to see why it could be construed as ‘stupid woman’,” he said, adding that that was also the advice of the professionals.Leadsom said the “country and this house will form their own conclusions” and that she “deeply regrets” Corbyn’s lack of apology.In one point of order, the Conservative MP Rachel Maclean said: “Read my lips: I do not believe him”, for which she was rebuked by Bercow.“It is well established that a member is to be taken at his or her word,” Bercow said.Labour MPs came back to the House to defend Corbyn and decry the state of the debate. Laura Pidcock, who recently returned from maternity leave, said: “I would like to say it was nice to be back. I just wonder what members of the public will draw from the chamber being used in this way?“I have heard from my constituency office today that residents have had to have parcels delivered today because they cannot afford to buy presents or food, and the chamber being used in this way is absolutely pathetic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f68540d72a9dfe387aca1d0a21e772a890bf1a67/0_167_1432_859/master/1432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70d6a93a19d58ad7f27d961a39648a30","title":"brexit andrea leadsom amber rudd second referendum","story":"Leader of Commons lays bare cabinet isions by dismissing idea of holding another voteAndrea Leadsom has rebuked Amber Rudd after the work and pensions secretary broke ranks with the government by saying there was a “plausible argument” for a second referendum if MPs voted down the EU withdrawal bill.Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, said: “We won’t have a second referendum. That is not government policy.”Laying bare cabinet splits on the issue, Leadsom told ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Thursday that a second referendum was not practical or desirable.Speaking to ITV’s Peston on Wednesday night, Rudd said: “I don’t want a people’s vote, or a referendum in general, but if parliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus, I could see there would be a plausible argument for it.”Leadsom was asked whether there would be a plausible argument for another referendum if the withdrawal agreement were voted down by parliament.She said: “No, absolutely not. We had the biggest democratic exercise and the majority voted to leave the EU. It is our duty to make sure we do that.“I would have to bring forward the legislation. It would take months and months, if not well over a year, simply to get the legislation through, by which time we would have left the EU.“I don’t understand why anybody thinks it is either a good idea or a practical idea.”Rudd admitted her comments would “distress” some of her Tory colleagues and stressed she was fully committed to Theresa May’s bill.Her intervention was welcomed as a “massive moment” by campaigners calling for a  “people’s vote”, with the Conservative MP and former minister Anna Soubry praising Rudd as “brave and principled”.Rudd also backed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to support if the prime minister’s deal were rejected.“Parliament has to reach a majority on how it’s going to leave the European Union,” she said. “If it fails to do so then I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues.”Rudd said an indicative vote would “flush out” MPs by forcing them to show their support for one option or another, and encourage those whose favoured ideas were rejected to reach a compromise.“We are going to have to find a way, as MPs, of working together to find a consensus, of agreeing on how to stop no deal taking place,” she said.Her comments were seized on by pro-EU Labour MPs including Owen Smith and Luciana Berger.Smith, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “Amber Rudd may be the first Tory cabinet member to say she’d rather have a people’s vote than allow a catastrophic no deal to unfold, but she won’t be the last. This is a massive moment for our campaign.”But the pro-Brexit Tory MP Marcus Fysh expressed disappointment and questioned whether Rudd should be in government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15174e274882c8b9d3b83d13fd66e180eba4c8c4/497_181_2020_1213/master/2020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed74f2bd4e92895566819e61452c6f2","title":"premiership 230m deal spending splurge","story":"• Deal with CVC Capital Partners gives 13 clubs £18m each• Clubs urged to spend windfall on grounds not players’ wagesPremiership Rugby has completed a deal thought to be worth around £230m with the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and has moved to ease concerns the windfall will be splurged on player wages.The deal was finalised on Wednesday after the clubs failed to reach an agreement at a previous board meeting. The initial approach from CVC, which made £8bn from its ownership of Formula One, was £275m for a majority stake but the clubs voted against ceding control in September.While some clubs such as Bath and Saracens are likely to use the windfall for stadium redevelopments, there are concerns other clubs will look to strengthen their squads and thereby inflate rapidly growing wages.Premiership Rugby hopes such short-termism will be avoided with the £7m salary cap to remain for at least the next two years and has urged the clubs to invest in “operations and infrastructure” having made a collective loss of £28.5m last year.“We have a salary cap in place and that’s not moving for the next couple of years,” said the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Mark McCafferty. “We are investing in operations and infrastructure, that’s the key. We will be able to invest at a greater level and build the competition out further.”Premiership Rugby also eased fears over what happens when CVC decides to sell up. “They are expecting to be in this for the long term and they understand what’s required to invest and build,” McCafferty said. “I expect Premiership Rugby in seven or eight years’ time to be an even more globally followed business. That expansion needs support.”The Premiership Rugby chairman, Ian Ritchie, also denied the deal will affect the £220m Professional Game Agreement with the Rugby Football Union, which governs player release. Ritchie, who brokered the deal in 2016 when he was the RFU chief executive, described CVC’s investment as “complementary” rather than being a competitor.Danny Cipriani’s hopes of an England recall for the Six Nations have been significantly dented after Gloucester confirmed he would be sidelined for up to six weeks with a chest muscle injury.

(After I’ve changed my email address.) GeoffreyGoogle’s motto used to be “don’t be evil”, but in the eyes of some it has now taken on the mantle of the “evil empire” from Microsoft, which Bill Gates and crew inherited from the IBM mocked in the Mac’s launch advert in 1984.The EU has fined Google €2.4bn (£2.2bn) for abusing its search monopoly by favouring its products. Most recently, Google was fined €4.34bn for “very serious illegal behaviour” in using Android “to cement its dominance as a search engine”, according to the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, a charge the company contests.Google started by taking over the search engine market. It now dominates smartphone operating systems (Android), browsers (Chrome), web-based email (Gmail), online video (YouTube) and maps. It is also challenging in other areas with its own cloud platform, an online office suite, Chromebooks, Waze, Nest and so on. Google is far advanced in driverless cars (Waymo) and artificial intelligence (DeepMind). Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.We can probably agree Google has won by delivering high-quality products, and more than 40 corpses in the Google Graveyard – soon to be joined by its awful social network, Google+ – prove it doesn’t always win. But there are other problems.First, Google now controls web development to the point where not even Microsoft can compete, as shown by the latter’s recent decision to replace its EdgeHTML browser engine with the open source Chromium on which Google’s Chrome browser is based. Users were supposed to benefit from competition between rival implementations of open web standards, but today Chromium and therefore Chrome is the standard.As Firefox-developer Mozilla has pointed out, “from a social, civic and inidual empowerment perspective, ceding control of fundamental online infrastructure to a single company is terrible”.Second, many of us have problems with Google’s business model, which the Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff has called “surveillance capitalism”. Google finances its free services by tracking users and targeting them with advertisements. In fact, it tracks you across the web even if you never visit any Google properties because other websites commonly use Google AdWords, AdMob, DoubleClick, Google Analytics, and its other tracking or advertising products.From your searches and site visits, Google probably knows more about you than your mother or your spouse, and there’s no telling where that information will eventually end up.If you use an Android phone, Google can also track your physical location, and if you turn that off, you lose directions, “find my phone” and other features.So, remember that avoiding Google products is only part of the problem. You will need to protect your privacy in other ways, too.The simplest way to avoid most Google products is to switch to the Microsoft or Apple equivalents, in whole or in part. Some would see this as jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. However, Satya Nadella’s new Microsoft is different from the old one, and driven by other metrics (usage instead of units). It is building a broader cross-platform ecosystem than either Google (everything online) or Apple (everything on Apple).The web-based Outlook email service is still not as good as Gmail, but you can use it from a desktop email client, and there’s a decent Mail app in Windows 10. There are also plenty of alternative services, including FastMail and ProtonMail.Cyanogenmod, an open source ROM to liberate Android phones, bit the dust a while ago, but the project is continuing as LineageOS.Google controls the browser market, so the best alternative to Chrome is Mozilla’s Firefox. With Opera and now Microsoft capitulating, Mozilla is the only major provider still committed to building its own standards-based browser.Fortunately, Chrome’s rendering engine has open source origins – Apple forked KHTML to create WebKit for Safari, then Google forked WebKit to create Blink for Chrome – so the base code is available in the form of Chromium. This has enabled lots of companies to build browsers based on Chromium, without the proprietary stuff that Google adds to create Chrome. Opera and Vivaldi are the most obvious examples, though you should also look at the privacy oriented Epic, among others.You will not be entirely free of Google, as you would be with Firefox, but it seems to me an acceptable compromise.Either way, I avoid using Chrome because now when you sign into a Google site, it signs you into the browser as well, unless you deactivate the feature.Google still has the best search engine, but Bing and DuckDuckGo are viable alternatives for the majority of searches. If you can’t avoid Google search completely, you can certainly reduce your usage.DuckDuckGo is a good choice because it is privacy oriented, and you can run Google searches from DDG by using a !bang command. (A bang is an American exclamation mark.) However, DDG’s sources include other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo and Yandex.StartPage – formerly ixQuick – is a Dutch-owned privacy-protecting search engine, while Qwant is a French one. Both get some results from other search engines, but Google still won’t know about you. (Qwant seems to be pretty good.)Mojeek is a British search engine that has its own web crawler, called MojeekBot.For image and reverse image searches, I recommend Yandex, which is Russian, Bing and TinEye.There have been plenty of websites that will download the videos you want to watch without you having to go to YouTube. Years ago, I used KeepVid. However, this approach does not suit Google because you never see any adverts. Also, these sites – which could be flaky to start with – tend to stop working properly, andor pop up multiple ad pages.The indirect approach does not suit users either because the whole idea is that you go to watch one YouTube video then get sucked into watching another dozen through random browsing.Web traffic statistics suggest there’s one property with both the technology and the capacity to take on YouTube, and that’s PornTube, but it’s not quite the same.Have you got a question?

From Pete Seeger’s 1959 rendition of the African American gospel We Shall Overcome, which became an anthem for the civil rights movement, to Dick Gaughan’s Ballad of ‘84, a clarion call for the Scottish miners’ strike, the combination of one singer and their guitar has had a potent effect on galvanising activists.Now, folk is turning its attention to the bees.The stakes are high and 25-year-old fiddle player Rowan Piggott believes that folk is the answer. “The environmental crisis is one of the biggest issues of my generation,” he says. “All of our political and economic problems pale in comparison, since they tend to go in cycles, whereas we have done irreversible damage with climate change.”A waifish presence in a tweed jacket, Piggott is surprisingly optimistic about the future. “People’s knowledge of the crisis is very general,” he says, “and they often don’t know what they can do to effect a meaningful change, so that’s why I started the Songhive project, to give people chances to get involved with the bees.”Since Piggott’s father is an acclaimed traditional Irish folk musician and his mother is a beekeeper, the project seemed inevitable. Piggott noticed an accumulation of folksongs about the plight of the bees, such as Lau’s 2012 instrumental Save The Bees, and decided to create an online archive to raise awareness.“I thought it’d be a nice way of reminding people that for thousands of years we’ve had a healthy respect for bees as part of our life-cycle and now that people are more distanced from the process of producing food, we have forgotten that and bees have become a mild annoyance,” he says.With the archive up and running and the folk community responding, Piggott decided to up the ante. “I always had the idea for making a record,” he says, “although I initially thought it would be a compilation of already-recorded music from the archive.” Due to costly licensing fees, the record became a collection of 11 songs written and recorded especially for the project. Piggott invested £1,000 of his own money and raised a £2,000 grant from the English folk dance and song society to print the finished CDs.Featuring Piggott himself and some of the British folk scene’s young stars, such as Rosie Hodgson and Georgia Lewis, as well as more established acts such as singer Nancy Kerr and songwriter Nick Burbridge, the album combines traditional folk instrumentation with bee-themed lyrics in the service of this environmental cause. Even the bees themselves are almost present, as their buzz is imitated by a shruti drone on Burbidge’s Queen’s Dream of Lost Fields, while Kerr’s Dark Honey addresses the production of honey from the sugary remnants of discarded Coke cans.Since the CD was released in March, half of its 1,000 copies has been sold, raising £5,000 for a Friends of the Earth campaign, the Bee Cause. Piggott has also been encouraging his audience to learn and perform bee folksongs from the archive and sign petitions. One such petition, to ban the use of the harmful insecticide neonicotinoid, was successful and passed the EU in April.“The response has been great,” he enthuses, “all ages have gotten involved. The older fans buy the record and the younger ones are active in spreading the message.”Rosie Hodgson, 26, contributed two compositions to Songhive and believes folk is the perfect vehicle for the environmental message. “Folk music was mostly created and performed by those who were in positions of vulnerability,” she says, “injustice is a common theme and it harnesses the power of a personal story, so one well-placed tale will inspire sympathy for a cause in a way that talking about the cause as a whole will not. There’s a magic that binds people when they sing together, especially in times of hardship.”Another contributor, Nancy Kerr, has made environmental awareness an integral part of her writing in recent years, with her last album, Instar, comprising folksongs about nature and conservation. For Kerr, born to a family of traditional musicians involved in protest music, folk is an activist’s genre. “The act of relating a narrative that stems from the experiences of disenfranchised people is an act of protest,” she says, “and that makes me view folk music as intrinsically political.”With CD stock expecting to be sold out by the end of the year, Piggott is looking towards a second album, perhaps widening the scope beyond the bees. “It’s not just bees, it’s other pollinators like butterflies that are in danger – everything’s in trouble,” he says.For now, though, he is planning a Songhive tour with Rosie Hodgson and some of Songhive’s other musicians. They are currently booking venues that have links to conservation, even hoping to serenade the bees in a wildflower meadow.“Bees are the perfect species to drive meaningful action because we feel so positively towards them. They are a linchpin species,” Hodgson says.For Piggott, the bees are a vehicle for optimistic action and a means for folk to be refocused to its political roots. “Folk music here isn’t the people’s music anymore,” he says, “it’s become commercialised and the general public don’t know what it should sound like. This project is about tapping back into that heritage and aiming it towards a cause that people can actively change right now, today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88ad78bf21779e57bc496363e70512054dbb303/760_136_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9dc7d492805dfeb60e97f7f78c23676","title":"china accused of tit for tat over detention of canadian woman","story":"Third Canadian held in China after recent arrest of Huawei executive in VancouverChina’s foreign ministry has said that a Canadian woman is undergoing “administrative punishment” for working illegally, after Canada’s government said a third Canadian had been detained in China.Chinese state security agents last week detained the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, saying both Canadians were suspected of endangering state security.The detentions of the Canadians followed the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Meng was arrested at the request of the US, which has been engaged in a trade war with China.China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, identified the third Canadian as Sarah McIver, who was serving “administrative punishment” due to “illegal employment”. Hua did not elaborate.“What I can tell you is that China and Canada are maintaining clear consular communication,” she told a daily news briefing.Hua, when asked if McIver’s case was connected to that of Kovrig and Spavor, pointed out that the nature of the cases were different, given the other two were accused of endangering national security.Hua referred further questions on McIver to the ministry of public security. It did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.The Canadian government has not identified the third person, though news reports in Canada have said she was McIver, and added she was an English teacher being held because of “visa complications”.Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged caution on Wednesday and said he would not be “stomping on a table” after China detained the third Canadian. He said he was asking China for more information on the detentions.The latest incident was “a very separate case” from the other two, Trudeau said. The Canadian government has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor.But Beijing-based western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believed the detentions were a “tit-for-tat” reprisal by China.China has demanded Meng’s immediate release and summoned in the Canadian and US ambassadors to complain about the case.Meng has been accused by the US of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating US sanctions.She was released on bail in Vancouver, where she owns two homes, while waiting to learn if she would be extradited to the US. Meng was due in court on 6 Febuary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4293a404318da2bb323cbe3797eb684f427d49d1/0_365_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73354d649a60944f8d9c428c2aa6ea8f","title":"ikea new zealand frenzy","story":"After years of rumours, the Swedish furniture store will open its first outlet in the countryNew Zealanders have been whipped into a frenzy by the news that Swedish furniture giant Ikea will be opening a store in their country, after years of rumours and speculation.Foreign minister Winston Peters quickly took credit for the news, saying he was sure his decision to open an embassy in Stockholm had played a part.“We set up an embassy in Stockholm about two months ago now and the great news is: here comes Ikea to be operating in New Zealand,” Peters told Newstalk ZB. “They had all these other years they didn’t come and now they’re coming.”The country’s largest media outlets issued breaking news alerts to disseminate the news, and stories about the opening ran as lead items on the homepages of news websites. Within hours of the announcement Ikea became the top trending item on Twitter in New Zealand.Professor Jonathan Elms from Massey University told TVNZ the opening would be “quite significant” for the country, and if it was located off the motorway between Auckland and Hamilton it could be “the link” that brings the two North Island cities together.“Rumours have been circulating for years about it coming to New Zealand,” Elms told TVNZ, adding that Ikea could cause unforeseen problems like traffic congestion. “It’s something new, something different, it’s definitely going to raise the bar.”On social media people joked that the orce rate in the country was sure to sky-rocket after the opening of Ikea, which largely sells flat-pack, do-it-yourself furniture which can occasionally be challenging to assemble.Although the news was largely greeted with enthusiasm by New Zealanders, some lamented the quiet South Pacific island being taken over by global mega-business, coming a week after US fast-food chain Taco Bell announced it would be opening a number of stores in the country. Although New Zealand is often used as a testing ground for big businesses to trial new products and technologies, large global clothing and homewares chains often skip New Zealand because of the small population, limited spending dollar and high freight costs."},{"url":null,"title":"construction of homes in dublin city halves","story":"The number of homes under construction in Dublin city is down almost 50 per cent on last year, with a 20 per cent drop across the region as a whole, according to a new report from the Government’s Dublin Housing Supply Task Force.Apartment construction rates in particular crashed in the last year following an announcement by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last December of plans to remove caps on building heights. The change did not come into force until this month.The numbers of apartments under construction fell by 25 per cent from the third quarter of last year to the same period this year, while those with planning permission but remaining unbuilt increased by almost 60 per cent.Figures for the third quarter of the year show a fall in the number of houses and apartments under construction from 7,393 in 2017 to 5,915 in 2018 across the four Dublin local authorities – a drop of 20 per cent.However in the Dublin city area, the decline is even worse, with a 49 per cent drop from 2,325 to 1,185 houses and apartments.While the decline in building activity was at its worst in the city, there was a drop in home building in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown of 15 per cent to 1,322, and in South Dublin of 12 per cent to 1,138 homes. Fingal was the only area where the number of homes under construction increased, with 2,348 houses and apartments being built, compared to 2,260 in the third quarter of 2017.These decreases in construction were “offset by the significant increase in housing completions this quarter”, the report said. The number of homes completed more than doubled, with 1,336 finished in the third quarter of the year up from 644 in the third quarter of 2017.However, the announcement by Mr Murphy last December that he intended to remove restrictions on the height of apartment blocks appears to have had a dampening effect on the sector. While house construction fell by 14 per cent from 3,763 to 3,221, the number of apartments being built fell by more than 25 per cent from 3,630 to 2,694.More starkly still, while the number of houses for which planning permission has been granted, but construction had yet to start rose by 4 per cent from 9,014 to 9,330, the number of apartments with planning permission remaining unbuilt rose by 59 per cent from 12,884 to 20,529.The failure of developers to act on permissions for apartment blocks was because their construction was not financially viable, Hubert Fitzpatrick, director of housing and planning with the Construction Industry Federation, said.“I would expect now the new guidelines are in place people will look at these projects again and perhaps lodge new applications.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The video was shot between Harold\u0026rsquos Cross, airports in Dublin, New York and Charlotte and North CarolinaThe Irish Cancer Society calls on HSE to stop \u0026lsquocruel and unusual\u0026rsquo practiceDocument outlines measures for a disorderly UK exit from European UnionPlans seek to ban companies insisting vouchers spent in one transactionConfirmation of hypothesis could guide exploration for life on other planetsFinancial reward not enough for many firms which fear reputational damage of videos on social mediaService planners understood to be satisfied with GP uptake and geographical spreadApartment building in capital dries up after announcement of height-guideline changesGovernment document sets out threat to Ireland in no-deal Brexit scenarioSasha Godalev (29) wants \u0026lsquoto give a voice to the voiceless\u0026rsquo and be an ambassador for victimsAirport apologises for any inconvenience but says safety is its \u0026lsquoforemost priority\u0026rsquoBank agrees to meet three Independent Deputies after sit-in on Baggot StreetCampaigners welcome measures by bloc but say they fall short of tackling pollution crisisJudge says it was a case of caregiver stress and suspended 18 month sentence in fullDepartment of Public Expenditure says average pay for nurses is \u0026euro57,000Michael Jones (24) drove Audi A3 which broke a red light at speed before crashingGames firm Electronic Arts fully entitled to dismiss one of its directors, High Court toldDesire to recoup investment of \u0026euro147m in new cruise ferry dictating move to Dublin Port"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3737938.1545301460!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is home what i knew or what i know new irish citizen s poem reflects on homesickness","story":"Poet Erin Fornoff from the US who has recently become an Irish citizen and is a regular on the Irish spoken word scene, has released ‘Home,’ a powerful piece of poetry film which reflects on homesickness.

The Government has unveiled further contingency plans to cope with a potential no-deal Brexit, identifying affected sectors that would require up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation.The no-deal plans, published last night, would include the purchase of land at Dublin port and Rosslare to prevent congestion from new customs, sanitary and animal health checks at the sea ports. The plan aims to tackle how Ireland would handle a no-deal scenario where the United Kingdom would be “a third country” outside the European Union from March 2019, would be no longer represented in EU institutions and would fall outside EU rules.“For Ireland, a no-deal Brexit would potentially involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral impacts,” the Government says in the 133-page contingency plan.“Grappling with the enormous range of impacts both in the immediate short term and in the longer term will involve difficult and significant choices of a practical, strategic and political nature.”The plan says Brexit has the potential to impact every element of the economy.“A no-deal Brexit would be an exceptional economic event which would be met with exceptional measures to support the continued operation of the Irish economy and our international trading links,” the report says.The Government has produced the plan 100 days ahead of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU as continuing political rifts in London over the proposal withdrawal agreement increase the possibility of no deal being agreed. The plans identify 45 issues that will require legislative changes in domestic primary and secondary legislation, though the Government would try to wrap these bills into as few pieces of legislation as possible.The report says the necessary legislative measures required in a no-deal scenario will be introduced in the Oireachtas in early January.The Government has asked all Ministers to identify non-Brexit legislation that is “absolutely essential for enactment” before the end of March 2019 in order to plan the parliamentary schedule in the coming months.“Given the proximity of the date of Brexit, it is now necessary in some cases to move from contingency planning to taking actions to mitigate the consequences of a no-deal Brexit,” the Government states. The Cabinet will discuss the increasing risks around a no-deal scenario again at a meeting scheduled for Thursday, January 3rd.The potential new legislation required in a no-deal scenario covers a erse variety of areas, including primary legislation in sectors ranging from healthcare, railway safety and broadcasting to secondary legislation for areas from justice and security to sea fisheries and maritime jurisdiction to the movement of pets.A site has been identified at Dublin port, the country’s busiest seaport, for an additional 33 inspection bays for trucks coming off ships and parking for 270 trucks to ensure parked vehicles do no halt other port traffic.The additional infrastructure required includes new office space for an additional 144 staff at the port, a dedicated border control post for live animals and a new public office with eight counters or hatches.Rosslare port will require 13 inspection bays for trucks disembarking ships, parking for 35 trucks, a dedicated border control post for live animals and a public office with six counters or hatches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawA no-deal Brexit will have “severe macroeconomic and trade impacts” which will involve “difficult and significant choices” for the Government, according to a document published by the Government last night which lays out in stark terms the threat to Ireland in the coming months.In a document that echoes challenges faced during the\u0026nbspbailout, officials warn that a hard Brexit next March would “impact every element of economic functionality: trade flows, supply chains, economic and business operations, the labour market, consumer confidence and spending”.It says a British crash out of the EU next March without an agreement would have a “very significant adverse economic and social impact” in the UK and “Ireland would also suffer considerably in that context”.Officials briefed the media and opposition politicians on the document last night at Government Buildings. It says a no-deal Brexit represents an “exceptional economic event which will be met with exceptional measures to support the continued operation of the Irish economy and our international trading links”.Although the Taoiseach has said that an emergency budget will not be required, the document says an increase in exchequer borrowing “and other measures” might be required.It says there would be particular pressures on certain sectors of the economy, naming “agri-food, fisheries, aviation and road transport, pharma-chemicals, electrical machinery, retail and wholesale business”.It says the economic impact is likely to be greater in the Border region and on smaller businesses that trade with the UK.The primary channel through which Brexit’s economic effects would emerge is through application of World Trade Organisation tariffs and regulatory ergence, the document says. And it warns that these could “affect supply chains and the cost andor availability of imports from the UK”.A further fall in sterling would hit the competitiveness of Irish business, it says, while an influx of UK migrants could result in “pressure on labour markets and housing markets and public services”.Some 45 legislative measures, including 21 pieces of primary legislation will need to be passed in the coming months.Though the document details significant amounts of planning, it is sketchy on specifics in some areas. There is no detail, for example, on how supplies of vital medicines are to be maintained, though Tánaiste Simon Coveney last night insisted there was no danger of food or medicine shortages. Mr Coveney accepted that there is more detail required in many of the areas.Speaking at Government Buildings after the document was published last night, Mr Coveney said avoiding a hard border after a no-deal exit would be “a very difficult thing to do”, though he reiterated the Government’s insistence that no preparations would be made for a border. He also said, however, no preparations were being made to avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, in Brussels on Wednesday , the European Commission published a batch of papers about no-deal planning.Among the commitments is a reaffirmation by the commission to continued funding of the EU peace programme in the northern Border counties until at least 2020.The 14 measures published on Wednesday, in areas including citizens’ rights, air landing rights and safety, and the free movement of animals, will be taken unilaterally by the EU on condition that the UK reciprocates fully.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt’s the last day of the Dáil session and Leo Varadkar is looking forward to taking some time off. He starts the morning with a visit to a secondary school in Ringsend.In the year since he became Taoiseach, his ability to indulge in small talk has improved in leaps and bounds. But there is still some way to go.He asks a group of students about their exams.“How-how-how are they goin’? I remember doing Christmas exams.”“But, em . . . and you finish then on Friday?”“Same,” nods the Taoiseach, on their level now. “Same here.”All set for Funderland, no doubt.And then the Taoiseach is, like: “So, em, looking forward to it. Hope you are too.”Mercifully, a teacher intervenes. “That’s great, thanks very much.”You would think Leo might have left well enough alone at this point. But no. He’s totally smashing this small-talk thing.He says a few words about international relations (because he is launching the Government’s Global Schools programme) and then looks over to where his buddy, the Minister for Housing, is seated. Ringsend College is in Eoghan Murphy’s Dublin Bay South constituency.“Do you recognise Eoghan?” the Taoiseach smilingly asks the students, because he’s one of their mates now.“He’s, eh, he’s your local TD,” perseveres Leo, grinning. Unlike Eoghan, who is glowering.Whatever about the students, or mortified Murph, the Taoiseach appears to be enjoying himself.“Do you know the names of any of the other TDs in the area?” he wonders.“They’re very shy,” interjects the kindly teacher. But Leo doesn’t get the hint.“So we’ll take a question from Abbie?” suggests the teacher, valiantly trying to move things along.But Leo, in the discomfited presence of his dudemeister Murph, can’t resist. “That wouldn’t happen in Blanchardstown.”Strained laughter followed by another awkward pause.So the teacher – she deserves a medal – swoops in.“So, em, Abbie is just here. . .”Finally, he stops.But before Leo could escape for his hols, he had to put in one more stint at Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil. It was a relatively low-key session, with the Ceann Comhairle dispensing Christmas good wishes and the party leaders following suit.But we had no novelty Christmas tie this year from Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh, disappointing all the kiddies around the country who tuned into RTÉ to see what tune it would play this year. They all looked a bit tired on the Sinn Féin benches, probably because they had their Christmas drinks the night before.In an historic first, the Shinners invited members of the media to enjoy a drink with them in the Dáil bar before they left for their knees-up. This was hailed as a milestone in the progression of the party.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil treated the hacks to more free drink upstairs in McGrattan’s bar near Government Buildings. Micheál Martin described it as “a very agreeable night” in the course of his Christmas felicitations to the chamber.Before the event, it was rumoured that the Fianna Fáil leader exhorted some of his more difficult charges to attend the drinks and talk to the members of the press because it would be a nice change for him to see them conversing before his eyes as opposed to behind his back, as they usually do.We hear an anti-abortion Fine Gael Senator stumbled upon the gathering by accident, and was momentarily confused. “This isn’t the Oireachtas Human Dignity Group,” he was heard to utter, before leaving for another part of the pub where members of the cross-party group – founders include Senator Rónán Mullen – were letting their hair down.A great night was had by all, but group members Mattie McGrath and fellow TDs Carol Nolan and Michael Collins were up bright and early so they could take part in a plan to occupy the Baggot Street offices of KBC bank in protest over the eviction of people from a house in Co Roscommon last week. The three, who were part of a wider protest, said they were also concerned with the way the bank deals with people in mortgage arrears.Meanwhile, back in the chamber in the post-luncheon period, the Dáil was hearing statements on the European Council meeting earlier this month. They were well under way when Mick Wallace arrived to speak. He was very full of the Christmas cheer.“Good to see you here, Taoiseach. Don’t normally see you here for Euro statements, you usually abscond the place before then.”Leo was gathering up his files. It was past three and he had been in the chamber since midday.Mick didn’t want him to go just as he was about to talk about Brexit and the announcement by Irish Ferries that the company is “unlikely” to continue sailings between Rosslare and France next year.He pleaded with the Taoiseach.“What, are you going already, are ya? Ah, come on. Eh, com’ere, sit down for a minute, come on, come on, sit down!”“I did stay here for everyone who was here for my contribution,” said the Taoiseach, on his feet.“Please. Wha? It won’t kill ya to sit down,” wheedled Mick.“Merry Christmas,” smiled Leo, skipping the joint.“What are you like? Em, oh, God help us,” spluttered Mick.“Anyway, listen. . .” And the TD for Wexford, wherein resides the port of Rosslare, got on with his speech and then vanished too.Later in the evening, the Taoiseach invited his Cabinet to join him for mulled wine and mince pies in Government Buildings.We don’t know if the Ministers of State were invited along too. If so, the guests will have wished Kilkenny’s John Paul Phelan all the best for his big day – the Minister of State for Local Government and Electoral Reform is getting married on Friday.Dáil Éireann returns on January 15th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3737918.1545300532!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit tory minister says there is plausible argument for second referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Amber Rudd speaks to the media outside the House of Commons. File photograph: Andy Rain EPAThere is a “plausible argument” for the public to be asked to vote again on Brexit if MPs remain deadlocked, a British cabinet minister has said.Amber Rudd acknowledged her comments would “distress” some of her Tory colleagues and stressed she was fully committed to the UK prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal.The UK work and pensions secretary insisted she did not want a referendum and called for MPs across the Commons to reach a consensus as a way of preventing a no-deal Brexit if Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is thrown out in January’s parliamentary showdown.But her intervention was welcomed as a “massive moment” by campaigners calling for a so-called people’s vote, with Tory former minister Anna Soubry praising Ms Rudd as “brave and principled”.Ms Rudd backed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to support if the prime minister’s deal is rejected.Ms Rudd told ITV’s Peston: “I don’t want a people’s vote, or a referendum in general, but if Parliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus I could see there would be a plausible argument for it.”She added: “Parliament has to reach a majority on how it’s going to leave the European Union. “If it fails to do so, then I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues.”Ms Rudd said an indicative vote would “flush out” MPs by forcing them to show their support for one option or another, and encourage those whose favoured ideas are rejected to reach a compromise.“We are going to have to find a way, as MPs, of working together to find a consensus, of agreeing on how to stop no-deal taking place,” she said. Her comments were seized on by pro-EU campaigners.Labour’s Owen Smith, a backer of anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “Amber Rudd may be the first Tory Cabinet member to say she’d rather have a people’s vote than allow a catastrophic no-deal to unfold, but she won’t be the last. This is a massive moment for our campaign.”Meanwhile, Ireland followed the UK and the European Union in setting out the latest stages of its no-deal Brexit planning.“In many significant ways, a no-deal Brexit would pose unique, unprecedented and extremely difficult challenges for the EU, including Ireland, and especially the UK,” the Irish Government document said.As part of the plan, Dublin Port is creating extra parking for hundreds of trucks from the UK awaiting inspection after Brexit.In London, Mrs May will meet her Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki for talks.The discussions are expected to focus on defence and security co-operation, but come as the Prime Minister is desperately trying to secure further reassurances from EU leaders about the Northern Ireland backstop measures in the Brexit deal before the crunch Commons vote in the week commencing January 14th.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who met the prime minister on Wednesday, said Mrs May’s goals were “a wee bit nebulous”.“There’s not a lot of detail there,” Ms Sturgeon said.“She says she’s working with the EU, trying to find assurances. I pressed her to give a bit more detail on that. I have to say it wasn’t forthcoming.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It is now behind countries such as Ireland, Australia and Canada and is just about the Czech and Slovak Republic. The quality of official development assistance (ODA) is one of the few measures of aid quality and is based on principles which the UK, along with other donor and recipient countries, agreed to in 2005.The UK, alongside a handful of other countries including Germany and the Netherlands, meets the United Nations target of spending 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on international aid.Index of aid quality | Country rankingsBut the report said that one of the reasons for the UK falling down the rankings could be because of the countries it chooses to give aid to. The report highlights how multiple studies have shown that aid is most effective when spent in poorer and better governed countries.But the UK spends around 50 per cent of its aid in countries that are governed poorly - three of its biggest recipients are Pakistan, Lebanon and Nigeria - both poorly governed and less poor.Ian Mitchell, the report’s author, said this focus on certain countries could have pulled the UK down the rankings.“The UK does focus on fragile states and less poor countries because they’re seen as a security issue. But is possible to give substantially to fragile states and to score well on aid quality, he said.The UK has an explicit strategy to dedicate at least 50 per cent of Department for International Development (DfID) funding to fragile states and regions.He added: Still, other countries that score among the top donors such as Denmark and Ireland also spend at least 50 per cent of their bilateral aid in (UK-defined) fragile states.UK country allocations should consider a range of factors, but examples of states that DfID defines as fragile but which are also low income include Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Niger.Disease of thorns | The battle to eliminate trachomaThe UK scored poorly on indicators looking at whether its aid aligns with donors’ objectives - again, this could be to do with the focus on fragile states, said Mr Mitchell.The UK has been channeling more of its ODA through other departments such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills - not just via DfID. The proportion spent by DfID fell from 79 per cent in 2012 to 75 per cent in 2016.This has been linked to a fall in the UK’s performance on transparency, dropping from first place to 13th place on the public accessibility of information on funding.“Other government departments aren’t meeting standards on transparency that we would expect,” said Mr Mitchell.Romilly Greenhill, UK director of the One Campaign, an advocacy group, said the report painted a worrying picture.“One of the main drivers of this is that increasing amounts of aid are being spent outside DfID, by departments who don’t meet the same high standards of poverty focus, effectiveness and transparency, she said. A DfID spokesperson said: “We disagree that UK aid quality has declined... To help countries drive their own development, the UK provides support in a way that reinforces and strengthens local responsibility, accountability and leadership.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security ​Department for International DevelopmentGatwick chaos as drones causes runway to close - live updatesBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39North Korea denounces \u0026#39negative impact\u0026#39 of mobile phonesComment: No deal Brexit could be the deal-making opportunity of a generationNorth Korea \u0026#39may have used foreign scientists to further its nuclear ambitions\u0026#39Barack Obama plays Santa to delight patients at children\u0026#39s hospital Yemeni woman arrives in California to visit dying son after being granted travel ban waiverPutin\u0026#39s annual press conference provides rare chance to challenge Russian leader on SalisburyComment: Did a stupid man say ‘stupid woman’?

Walker.To the Christian charity helping him keep his benevolence secret from the world, he was George Herbert Walker Bush – the 41st president of the United States.Compassion International, which helps poor children around the world through a network of local churches, revealed for the first time this week that the late president, who died last month, had quietly sponsored a Filipino boy named Timothy for 10 years.The organisation released a number of Bush’s heartwarming letters to his young charge.I want to be your new pen pal, Bush wrote in his initial letter sent on January 24, 2002.I am an old man, 77 years old, but I love kids and though we have not met, I love you already, said the former president, identifying himself as a resident of Texas.A letter from former US President George HW Bush to his pen pal Timothy, then 7-years-oldBush’s former press secretary Jim McGrath confirmed the authenticity of the letters.This is but one of seemingly countless acts of kindness that George Bush performed through the years without fanfare, but rather because it was what was in his heart, McGrath said.Bush began sponsoring Timothy with a monthly donation in 2002 until his graduation from the charitable programme in 2012. Through all of that time, Bush’s true identity was kept secret due to security concerns.At times, Bush’s letters contained hints of his true identity, such as one in which he wrote: I got to go to the White House at Christmas time. Here is a little booklet that I got at the White House in Washington.In others, he offered gentle advice.I sure hope you like school and athletics. I do. I am an old man – now 78 – but I feel young at heart, Bush wrote.A picture of Timothy, aged 7, with a letter he sent to his pen pal former US President George HW BushBush also occasionally sent gifts to Timothy, who spoke in his letters of loving to draw, and playing basketball and guitar.I’d like to thank you for the letter you sent me, as well as the drawing pad, colored pen and colored pencil, Timothy wrote in 2004.At age 17, he graduated out of the program and a charity employee revealed to him the identity of his pen pal. Timothy was stunned, the organisation told US media.The charity has since lost touch with Timothy, but its former president Wess Stafford is sure of Bush’s impact on the young man’s life.We may not know where Timothy is, but we know he’s now living a successful life, Stafford told CNN.Please review our commenting policyGatwick chaos as drones causes runway to close - live updatesBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39North Korea denounces \u0026#39negative impact\u0026#39 of mobile phonesComment: No deal Brexit could be the deal-making opportunity of a generationNorth Korea \u0026#39may have used foreign scientists to further its nuclear ambitions\u0026#39Barack Obama plays Santa to delight patients at children\u0026#39s hospital Yemeni woman arrives in California to visit dying son after being granted travel ban waiverPutin\u0026#39s annual press conference provides rare chance to challenge Russian leader on SalisburyComment: Did a stupid man say ‘stupid woman’?

In an earlier interview, Andrei Lankov, a professor at Seoul’s Kookmin university, told the  that the regime faced was fighting against inevitable change. “Information is getting in. Kim Jong-un is now taking it very seriously, he is doing what he can to prevent people from learning too much about the outside world. But he cannot fully stop it.” Please review our commenting policyGatwick chaos as drones causes runway to close - live updatesBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39Comment: No deal Brexit could be the deal-making opportunity of a generationNorth Korea \u0026#39may have used foreign scientists to further its nuclear ambitions\u0026#39Barack Obama plays Santa to delight patients at children\u0026#39s hospital Yemeni woman arrives in California to visit dying son after being granted travel ban waiverPutin\u0026#39s annual press conference provides rare chance to challenge Russian leader on SalisburyComment: Did a stupid man say ‘stupid woman’?

Joint Chinese and North Korean papers on automotive technology had set off alarm bells as they included a computer system that could make the axels on a truck operate independently, said Mr Pollack. “That is something that is not associated with an ordinary truck. There are civilian applications for that but in North Korea the obvious use for that is a missile launching vehicle,” he revealed. Such an extensive analysis of the risks of scientific collaboration with North Korea is rare, but it is not the first time the issue has been raised. Last year, Ken Kato, director of the Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia, wrote to the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, urging them to close a legal loophole that allegedly allowed pro-North Korean scientists to remain in sensitive research positions. Students wear virtual reality goggles during a science class at Pyongyang Teachers\u0026#39 University“There are six Korean scientists who have been able to remain in sensitive research positions after claiming to have switched their political allegiances to South Korea,” Mr Kato claimed on Thursday. He has not yet received a UN response to his earlier enquiry. Mr Pollack and his team conclude that “UN member states must decide what research activities by their nationals or within their territory lie within the scope of sanctions, and which activities are better avoided in order to uphold the integrity of the sanctions regime.  He added: “We do not want to hand Kim Jong-un a shortcut to advancing his military, advancing his weapons of mass destruction.”But the complicated nature of scientific research also creates a dilemma about where to draw the line. Mr Pollack stressed that concerns over the misuse of some research should not lead to a “blanket ban” on scientific collaboration with the secretive regime, which prizes scientists so highly that it awards them with the best housing in the capital, Pyongyang. “You would have to have very strong reasons to shut the North Koreans out, bearing in mind that science contributes to human welfare and progress. It’s not all about weapons,” he said. North Korean children are taught to value science from an early ageMany Western researchers are heavily vetted by their governments before they can proceed.  British cooperation with Pyongyang over the years has included “frontiers on mathematics”, engineering principles and, more recently, studies of Mount Paektu, a volcano on North Korea’s border with China. James Hammond, a geophysicist at the Birkbeck University of London, who has been working on the project alongside American, Chinese and North Korean colleagues, told NPR that it took almost two years to get US and UK government approval to carry in sensitive seismic equipment. Research on the volcano could prove vital to saving many lives if there was a future eruption, Mr Pollack pointed out. “I think it may be the case that we don’t do enough when there are humanitarian issues. In particular, epidemiology comes to mind. In both China and North Korea there is a lot of drug-resistant tuberculosis, for example… And disease doesn’t care that much about borders,” he said.  Finally, he argued, scientific collaboration made sense from a strategic point of view. Towards the end of the Cold War, cooperation between Soviet and American scientific establishments helped to build bridges between the two enemies. “Having these bridges between scientists is not a bad thing from a perspective of enlightened self-interest,” he said.   Please review our commenting policyGatwick chaos as drones causes runway to close - live updatesBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39North Korea denounces \u0026#39negative impact\u0026#39 of mobile phonesComment: No deal Brexit could be the deal-making opportunity of a generationBarack Obama plays Santa to delight patients at children\u0026#39s hospital Yemeni woman arrives in California to visit dying son after being granted travel ban waiverPutin\u0026#39s annual press conference provides rare chance to challenge Russian leader on SalisburyComment: Did a stupid man say ‘stupid woman’?

The Russian leader has previously claimed the men were civilians and called the allegations against them “nonsense”.He has not been asked directly about reporting by The  and others that revealed the men\u0027s true identities as GRU officers Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin.Following the news that the US is to pull out of Syria, it\u0027s hoped that Mr Putin will address Russian involvement in the conflict. But Mr Putin prefers to focus on the economy and domestic issues at his press conferences, answering questions from far-flung regions that rarely gain national attention.Each year the event has a whiff of medieval pageantry. Reporters try for a question in a last-ditch attempt to make Mr Putin aware of a local problem, not unlike when Russians would wait in line for a chance to appeal directly to the tsar.The Kremlin this week asked journalists not to bring posters larger than A3 format so as not to obstruct the television cameras. This year, a journalist from one energy-producing region brought a vial of oil.State television began a countdown to the press conference 24 hours in advance and covered even minor details about the preparations, such as the different chairs that were being considered for Mr Putin and his press secretary to sit on during the marathon event.How to dodge a question. Russia Today asked Putin about the Skripal case, but didn\u0027t mention the suspects accused of the Salisbury poisoning. The president previously claimed they were civilians, but documents and former neighbours have indicated they were in military intelligence.  “This is a politicised Russophobic approach, it\u0027s just an excuse to organise another attack on Russia, if weren\u0027t the Skripals I\u0027m sure they would have thought up something else to contain Russia\u0027s\u0027 development,” Mr Putin responded and moved on without addressing his dubious previous claim. Mr Putin said there were currently no plans for a prisoner exchange for the Ukrainian sailors captured in the Kerch strait last month.Kiev\u0027s intermediary Viktor Medvedchuk came to Moscow recently and asked about the possibility of freeing them. I said this question can\u0027t be decided until the criminal case against them is brought to an end,” he said.Mr Putin blasted Washington for its intention to withdraw from the intermediate nuclear forces treaty and warned that another key arms agreement with the United States would come to an end in 2021. Russia has been forced to develop new nuclear weapons “that don\u0027t exist elsewhere in the world” to preserve strategic parity, he said.  “We will survive, we will guarantee our security, but for humanity this is very bad. It brings us closer to the edge,” he said.  He also slammed the development of tactical warheads in the West as a “tendency for nuclear threshold to be lowered.”Focusing on Russia\u0027s economy, which until recently was in recession due to low oil prices and sanctions, Mr Putin has said GDP growth this year will be 1.72 per cent.He called on Russia to “enter a new league” and become the fifth-largest economy in the world, an “achievable goal”. It is currently outside the top 10.Journalists are competing to get Mr Putin\u0027s attention by holding up eye-catching home-made signs.The editor of The Insider, a publication that participated in the initial investigations to uncover Chepiga and Mishkin\u0027s real names, was not allowed into the press conference despite having been accredited.Please review our commenting policyGatwick chaos as drones causes runway to close - live updatesBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39North Korea denounces \u0026#39negative impact\u0026#39 of mobile phonesComment: No deal Brexit could be the deal-making opportunity of a generationNorth Korea \u0026#39may have used foreign scientists to further its nuclear ambitions\u0026#39Barack Obama plays Santa to delight patients at children\u0026#39s hospital Yemeni woman arrives in California to visit dying son after being granted travel ban waiverPutin\u0026#39s annual press conference provides rare chance to challenge Russian leader on SalisburyComment: Did a stupid man say ‘stupid woman’?

Such are the perils of learning a language without ever speaking it.“Eventually, if you want to learn a language, you usually speak to a human being,” says Witte. It\u0027s an unusual position, given Witte is a co-founder of Babbel, the highest grossing language-learning app. Did he really just say that\u0026nbspto learn a language, you need to do it in person?“Yes of course! There’s no denying that. But that doesn’t mean the app doesn’t make a lot of sense.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHow millennials are breathing fresh life into the Irish languageThe funniest words in the English language, from boff to coochRob Delaney to deliver first CBeebies Bedtime Story in sign languageFrom busuu, to Babbel to the UK-based Memrise, language-learning apps have proved big business. DuoLingo claims to have the most users, at 300 million. Babbel doesn\u0027t release user numbers but says it signed up 1 million US users in the last year. Thanks to its subscription model, Babbel\u0026nbspis the top grossing language app. Its US sales alone rose 140 per cent in the second half of 2017. Paying users rose by 40 per cent in the second half of 2017 in the US, up from 40,000 last August, overtaking Europe.In a bid to help people get out and practise their skills with real humans, Babbel has announced that it will start offering language-learning holidays. It has acquired Berlin startup LingoVentura, which handles bookings for 200 language schools in over 100 cities and countries.Babbel users will be able to find these language-learning holidays through a separate part of the app, Witte says. Backstage at TechCrunch Disrupt, a tech conference in Berlin, he\u0026nbspadded: “We don’t want to interrupt the learning journey, because it’s not an advertising tool, but we will make sure that if you want this kind of service you can find it.”Babbel has come a long way since it was founded in 2007 by Witte and Thomas Holl, two software engineers with no experience in languages. “When we started out trying to build a better language learning website in 2007, pre App store, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into,” Witte says. “We were three arrogant tech guys saying, this problem is already solved, how hard can it be?”A free iteration of Babbel went online in January 2008 and attracted investors alongside startup funding from the European Structural Fund. But Witte quickly detected an important problem: “You couldn’t learn a language with the thing we had built.”The engineers had built a vocabulary trainer and given it a user-friendly interface. They learned two things: “One, that you would never learn a language off that, and two, you would never make money off it.”So they rebuilt the app from scratch and started asking people to pay. Babbel charges between €12.99 (£12) and €8.25 (£7.35)\u0026nbsp a month, depending on how long users sign up for, unlike its biggest competitor, DuoLingo, which is free.\u0026nbsp“DuoLingo is free, and that’s their problem,” Witte says. “We’ve been there. It’s hard to make money with a free product. I’m not talking about becoming filthy rich, I’m talking about paying your freaking bills! And making sure your people can pay their bills.”Mea Culpa: what is your alibi? Language is changing, your honourAt the same time, Babbel rethought its approach to language learning. Rather than thinking of it as a tech problem, they began to think of it as a human problem. “You can’t substitute the hundreds of years of research and experience that there is in language learning with technology without even looking,” Witte says. “We did that, so I am totally guilty of it. We also made the humble move to say, we were wrong.”Babbel now employs 450 staff and hundreds of language experts. “Tech matters - all the founders are tech people,” Witte says. “We’re totally excited about machine learning and all the fancy stuff out there, but in time we realised that these are just tools. We can be excited about them, but it’s the way you use them that matters.”Babbel originally set out to build an adaptive language learning tool, with exercises put together by machines. But machines aren’t as good at teaching languages as humans and they can throw out random phrases. “Randomness is what as a language learner is pretty off-putting,” Witte says. “So we use stories.”Babbel is using tech to experiment\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspadapting stories without breaking them. The idea is for\u0026nbsptwo people to be able to invest different amounts of time in learning a language and still have a consistent human story to guide them. The tech is used to adapt the programme to the speed of the learner.\u0026nbspThe missing piece of the jigsaw for Babbel is the ability to help the user learn to speak, or to move beyond reading Flaubert and into ordering breakfast. But while Babbel has embraced language holidays, it has no plans to move fully offline and into language schools, Witte says. “We don’t want to get into the language school business, we are not disruptive, we don’t want to eat anyone else’s lunch,” he says. “Many of them are very small, family run and offer a very personal service. To replicate that personal element is very tough at scale and might not be what we’re good at.”Instead, holidays offer a chance for app-users to try out simple conversations that they have practised on the app. Witte remembers using Babbel to learn a few phrases in Turkish before going to a restaurant to order a doner kebab. “They laughed at me, of course they did, but they appreciated the effort,” he says. “It felt good, and that’s the kicker that keeps you going. If you never speak the language, it’s hard to learn.”He adds: “The app can bring you pretty far, but machines are\u0026nbspnot\u0026nbsphuman and never will be. If there is one thing that makes us human, it’s language.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It does not yet deliver a long-term solution to Italy’s economic problems. But it allows us to avoid an excessive deficit procedure at this stage,” said the vice-president of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday.Is Italy about to re-open the eurozone crisis with its new budget?But he added that the decision could be overturned and fines could be levied on Rome in January if the government does not deliver on its side of the agreement.The citizens’ income and the rolling back of pension reforms have only been delayed, rather than scrapped as policy goals.The leader of the League and deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, had previously pledged that the government would not change “a comma of the budget” but pressure from the financial markets and the hardline from Brussels seems to have caused them to rethink.“To have avoided the infringement procedure is a victory of common sense for the good of Italian citizens,” he said on Wednesday.\u0026nbsp“The agreement reached today shows unambiguously that the European Commission is not the enemy of the Italian people,” said the economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici.“We are not a machine made up of insensitive bureaucrats, imposing austerity and denying democracy. I hope that today we can move beyond such caricatures. I hope that today we can also put to rest any doubts over Italy’s place in Europe.”Italian 10-year bond yields spiked to 3.7 per cent in October, the highest since 2014, after the Italian government said it would allow its deficit to rise, threatening to push the government in Rome into another fiscal crisis.They have since retreated to 2.7 per cent, as markets reacted\u0026nbspto signals of a likely compromise between the populists and the commission.At the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011, when it looked like the single currency area could break apart, Italian 10-year yields were above 7 per cent.The Italian stock market was up 1.94 per cent on the day on Wednesday lunchtime in response to the deal, with bank stocks 3.6 per cent higher.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Hundreds of employees also walked out of their European headquarters in Dublin, as well as, other offices in different parts of the worldProtesters block Parliament Square in London as the environmental group Extinction Rebellion launches a mass civil disobedience campaign demanding action on climate changeProfessor Becky Francis, director of the UCL-Institute of Education and co-author of the report, said: “Our five-year analysis of sponsor academies’ provision for disadvantaged pupils shows that while a few chains are demonstrating transformational results for these pupils, more are struggling.“We continue to find it perplexing that the government has done so little to explore the methods of these successful chains and to distil learning to support others.”Academies were\u0026nbsponly included if they have been with the same sponsor since 2014 in order to give the\u0026nbspsponsor\u0026nbsptime to have some impact on performance.The least successful academy\u0026nbspchains for poorer children also tended to have poor results for all children, the report found.Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “This report is a stark reminder that the academies programme is failing to support many disadvantaged children, and is not the answer to the challenges facing our schools.“Academisation in and of itself does not improve educational standards or outcomes for children, yet the government has\u0026nbspcontinued to treat it as the solution at a time when it\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspslashed school budgets and seen teacher numbers fall.”Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said: “The foundational myth of the academies programme, that it would boost educational attainment among young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, must now be laid to rest as just that: a myth.“This report conclusively shows that the expansion of multi-academy trusts (MATs) under the academy programme has not delivered on what it was supposed to. In fact it’s done the opposite, with two-thirds of academy chains performing below the national average for disadvantaged pupils.”The union leader called for schools who have been failed by trusts to return to local authority control – and she urged for a wholesale return of schools to a system of “democratic oversight”.She added: “The government should reflect on what impact its dysfunctional system is having on children, parents and schools staff across the country. Now is the time to admit failure and move on.”Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, added: “Regrettably, this is yet another report condemning the direction of travel of the government’s policies and highlighting the need for a school system that genuinely works for everyone.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of heads’ union NAHT, said: “Converting to academy status can be a positive step for schools, but as this report, and other evidence shows, academy conversion is not an automatic guarantee of lasting improvement, or a better education for all pupils.”Former academy chain boss banned from teaching for \u0027second salary\u0027He added that all schools, regardless of type, face the same barriers to success – including funding cuts,\u0026nbspteacher shortages and accountability pressures.\u0026nbsp“These are the realities of the current system. We should not presume that one school type is better than another,” Mr Whiteman said.\u0026nbspA Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are striving for a world class education for all children, regardless of background. Converting to become an academy is a positive choice that is made by hundreds of schools every year.“The growing number of successful multi-academy trusts are playing an important part in driving up standards in our schools by allowing them to work together to focus their efforts on quality teaching.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It does not yet deliver a long-term solution to Italy’s economic problems. But it allows us to avoid an excessive deficit procedure at this stage,” said the vice-president of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday.Is Italy about to re-open the eurozone crisis with its new budget?But he added that the decision could be overturned and fines could be levied on Rome in January if the government does not deliver on its side of the agreement.The citizens’ income and the rolling back of pension reforms have only been delayed, rather than scrapped as policy goals.The leader of the League and deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, had previously pledged that the government would not change “a comma of the budget” but pressure from the financial markets and the hardline from Brussels seems to have caused them to rethink.“To have avoided the infringement procedure is a victory of common sense for the good of Italian citizens,” he said on Wednesday.\u0026nbsp“The agreement reached today shows unambiguously that the European Commission is not the enemy of the Italian people,” said the economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici.“We are not a machine made up of insensitive bureaucrats, imposing austerity and denying democracy. I hope that today we can move beyond such caricatures. I hope that today we can also put to rest any doubts over Italy’s place in Europe.”Italian 10-year bond yields spiked to 3.7 per cent in October, the highest since 2014, after the Italian government said it would allow its deficit to rise, threatening to push the government in Rome into another fiscal crisis.They have since retreated to 2.7 per cent, as markets reacted\u0026nbspto signals of a likely compromise between the populists and the commission.At the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011, when it looked like the single currency area could break apart, Italian 10-year yields were above 7 per cent.The Italian stock market was up 1.94 per cent on the day on Wednesday lunchtime in response to the deal, with bank stocks 3.6 per cent higher.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

She is saved from muggers by a handsome man, and romance blooms when he shows her his side of the city.Other Victorian sources seem to bear out Ms Hawksley’s suggestion that Dickens was writing what he saw when he had the Ghost of Christmas Present show Scrooge “cheerfulness abroad … poulterers’ shops still half open, and the fruiterers’ radiant in their glory … hung-up mistletoe … pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids.”And if there were inventors of Christmas customs around in the mid-19th\u0026nbspcentury, you could argue that Dickens was not foremost among them.\u0026nbspIn her book, Hawksley describes how while Dickens was busy writing A Christmas Carol in 1843, the civil servant Henry Cole was busy inventing the Christmas card.\u0026nbspCole, later to become the first director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, did not have the time to write long letters to all whom he wished to contact over the festive period.He hit upon the idea of writing a short card instead, and for the artwork he commissioned the quintessentially Victorian artist John Callcot Horsley: a man of great talent, known to more waggish elements as “Clothes Horsley” on account of his campaign against the male students of the Royal Academy being allowed to set eyes upon naked female models during their drawing classes.Horsley produced a suitably decorous image of the Cole family, clothed, behind a banner reading: “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you.”Callcott Horsley\u0026nbspBut when it came to Christmas being a time for family, few could surpass the example of the young royal family.\u0026nbspIt was while promoting such family values that Prince Albert also imported the Christmas tree tradition from his native Germany.\u0026nbspIn 1848 The Illustrated London News showed him with Queen Victoria and their children around a beautifully decorated tree.\u0026nbspSuddenly it wasn’t just a select group of aristocrats who wanted a Christmas tree in their living room.The year before, inspired, or so the marketing men claimed, by the crackle of a warm fire, London confectioner Tom Smith invented his first Christmas cracker in 1847 (although it took him until the 1860s to get the bang mechanism right).\u0026nbspDickens, meanwhile, could not be accused of inventing excessive wrapping, but it could be claimed he suffered because of it.\u0026nbspHis insistence on paying out of his own pocket for lavish presentation –\u0026nbspgold embossed cover, hand-coloured illustrations by John Leech – meant that when A Christmas Carol subsequently sold out, its huge production costs left Dickens with just £230 rather than the £1,000 he had been expecting.\u0026nbspAnd if the Ghost of Christmas Present as described by Dickens and drawn by Leech bore a passing resemblance to Father Christmas, he was very much a work in progress, clad in Pagan green, his beard brown, not white.It was the German American illustrator Thomas Nast who, in the 1860s, inspired by Clement Clarke Moore’s poem The Night Before Christmas and the elves of Bavarian folklore, did the most to give Santa red clothes, a white beard and a North Pole workshop.What Dickens did do, though, was give Christmas one heck of a PR push.\u0026nbsp“He was showing what was going on,” says Ms Hawksley, “And making it even more so. After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”Gustave ​​Doré (Alamy)These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”Alston: Poverty UK\u0027s \u0027biggest challenge\u0027 and\u0026nbspMPs are in \u0027state of denial\u0027 about itWhat frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

The principle of sanctions is there’s conditionality.”Mr Stephens then asked the secretary of state to confirm that she meant people should take zero-hour contracts or “insecure work”, to which Ms Rudd said: “Well I would say yes, if people are offered work, they should take it.”Labour MP Neil Coyle then intervened, saying: “If it’s prostitution? Because that’s the reality for some of the people directly affected. We’ve had that example here.”Discussing universal credit more broadly, the work and pensions secretary admitted there were problems with the new system,\u0026nbspand that the government “sometimes is not as good as it should be at rolling out hugely ambitious new changes”.Universal credit could be ‘disastrous’ for disabled people, MPs warnShe continued: “It is changing, but we are only at the foothills in some respects, so I’m cautious about saying it’s coping well enough to be absolutely clear about how successful it’s going to be in the next few years.”She also implied there may be further delays to the roll out of the welfare reform, saying: “It’s right to have goals, but I will be on top of making sure problems don’t emerge that we don’t address, and if we need to, slow down.”On the two-child limit, a policy that restricts the payment of tax credits and universal credit to the first two children in a family and is currently being challenged in court, Ms Rudd accepted concerns but claimed she may not be able to make changes to it.“I do support the policy that people need to consider when they’re having a third child their income as people in work do, but I do share your concerns about the retrospective element,” she said.“It’s not straightforward because it has already been legislated for, but\u0026nbspI accept the concerns.”The roll out of universal credit has come under intense criticism in recent months, with warnings that it could be “disastrous” for disabled people, places domestic abuse victims at heightened risk and can harm people’s mental health, among other concerns.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If it fails to do so, then I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues.”Her intervention\u0026nbspwas hailed as a “massive moment” by People’s Vote campaigners, with Tory former minister Anna Soubry describing it as brave and principled.However Ms Leadsom\u0026nbspdismissed her comments outright as she said a fresh vote would be unacceptable.The Commons leader told the\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme: It\u0027s not government policy.I myself think it would undermine the biggest democratic exercise ever, where we had a clear majority to leave the European Union.To have a second referendum would unfortunately be going back to people and telling them they have got it wrong and they needed to try again. I think it would be unacceptable.Ms Leadsom\u0026nbspconfirmed she had been considering plans for a no-deal Brexit, which is the default position if parliament cannot come to some kind of agreement.She said she was looking at a managed no-deal, which some Brexiteers favour, as an alternative solution if the prime minister\u0027s deal is vote down.A managed no-deal does not necessarily mean there is no withdrawal agreement at all,\u0026nbspMs\u0026nbspLeadsom\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This is all speculation, but what I am looking at is trying to find an alternative that, in the event we cannot agree to this deal, that there could be a further deal that looks at a more minimalist approach that allows us to leave with some kind of deal and some kind of implementation period that avoids a cliff edge, that avoids uncertainty for businesses and travellers and so on.It comes as Ms May was due to meet her\u0026nbspPolish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki for talks in London, as she desperately seeks further reassurances from EU leaders about controversial backstop plan\u0026nbspbefore the crunch Commons vote in the week of January 14.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The UK would then stay in the EU and there would be no change to its current relationship.When is the last date Article 50 can be revoked?\u0026nbspMajor calls for Article 50 to be revoked ‘with immediate effect’The ECJ ruled that revocation can happen within the two year negotiating period, or any extension to it. So the current last possible date is 29 March 2019, when Britain is set to leave – but it could be extended further if the 27 other EU countries unanimously decide to grant an extension.\u0026nbspAdditionally, if a withdrawal agreement somehow comes in earlier, then revocation would not be possible from that point – though this appears unlikely for the UK given the current course of events.Does it need approval by the EU?No approval from any EU institution or member state is needed – the ability to revoke Article 50 is the departing member state’s alone.\u0026nbspIronically, given some of the arguments at the referendum, the ECJ ruled this is because under EU law the withdrawal process “reflects a sovereign decision to retain its status as a member state of the European Union, a status which is neither suspended nor altered by that notification”.Who can ask for revocation: the parliament, the government, the prime minister?\u0026nbspThe ECJ says the decision to withdraw the notification has to be made in line with the country’s “own national constitutional requirements” – whatever they may be.Details of post-Brexit immigration policy under wraps until 2020Given the UK Supreme Court ruled that Article 50 could only be triggered with a vote of parliament, it is quite likely that it would need to be revoked by a vote of parliament. The court’s advocate general said in his recommendation that it was “logical that the revocation of that notification also requires parliamentary approval” given it was required to trigger the process.\u0026nbspThe government’s lawyers appear to have conceded this point: in their submission to the ECJ during the course of this case they said parliament must have “directed the government” to withdraw Article 50.However, neither of these strong indications actually make it law. Given what’s riding on the question and the ambiguity of the UK constitution, there is likely to be a legal challenge no matter what happens. Only then will we be absolutely certain. But it’s probably a parliamentary vote.\u0026nbspAre there any constraints, and does a reason have to be given?No reason has to be given. The advocate general’s opinion prior to the judgment said member states could not use Article 50 notification and revocation as an “abusive practice” – and they have to be acting in good faith. There was no mention of this in the final ruling, but the court did say the withdrawal had to be based on an “unequivocal and unconditional decision”.\u0026nbspCan this be used to temporarily postpone or suspend withdrawal?No, or at least not officially. The text of Article 50 spells out a formal process for extending the Article 50 negotiating period, and that requires a unanimous vote of the European Council. As mentioned above, the revocation has to be an “unequivocal and unconditional decision”.However, once the UK has revoked Article 50, there would be nothing stopping it from deciding to leave again. So this would be quite difficult to police, and in practice it could potentially be used to reset the two year negotiating period. This would probably make other\u0026nbspEU member states, and officials, extremely angry however.Would anything else have to be done to stop Britain leaving the EU?As far as EU law is concerned, no. But there is also the matter of UK statute law, which enshrines the exit date in domestic legislation. The status of this is a matter of debate – though given a Commons majority would be required to revoke Article 50, further votes would probably be a formality.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It will be a system that will bring net migration down to more sustainable levels.“If you look at the current level of migration, the latest stats show 273,000. Most people agree that is very high, certainly by historical standards. In the last two decades it has been in the hundreds of thousands. If you go back further than that, it was much lower.There is no specific target. It will be a system that will bring net migration down to more sustainable levels“What we want to do is bring it to a level where it is sustainable in the sense that it meets first our economic need and at the same time it is not too high, a burden on our communities or on our infrastructure.”Mr Javid has also been reticent to repeat the target in previous interviews and had signalled an intent in the Commons to move away from the “hostile environment” policies Ms May promoted while doing his job.Ms May has strongly resisted pressure to abandon the target from senior ministers over many years, including from George Osborne when he was chancellor.But as news of the target’s absence from the white paper spread, Ms May was asked by Labour MP Chris Elmore whether it was still the government’s intention to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands, and replied that it was.Created with Sketch.Brexit betrayal march in London Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester carrying a noose at the Brexit betrayal march.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And we expect Lebanon to take action to protest against this, and not to give into this.”Inside the Hezbollah tunnel that Israel never foundThe Israeli army said it had\u0026nbspso far discovered four tunnels running from\u0026nbspLebanon into Israel, and\u0026nbsphas begun destroying those on its side of the border.On Wednesday, at the site of the first tunnel discovered, in the border town of Metula,\u0026nbspa senior army official said the operation had no time limit and they believed there were several more passageways which would soon be unearthed.This has set Hezbollah back several years, the\u0026nbspimpact on them is big, said the\u0026nbspcommander,\u0026nbspin front of soldiers who were busy at work\u0026nbspdrilling dozens of holes and using radar to look for further passages.This operation does not have a time limit.\u0026nbspWe are going to find each and every tunnel which is a risk to civilians in the northern area, he added.\u0026nbspThe UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it had inspected the sites and confirmed that two of the tunnels cross the Blue Line, the demarcation\u0026nbspthat separates the two countries.It said the tunnels were\u0026nbsp“a matter of serious concern” and constituted a breach of the UN resolution that ended the 2006 war.Metula on the Israel-Lebanon border (Bel Trew)In his most forceful statement yet on the matter, Mr Netanyahu said: “We are holding Lebanon accountable.” \u0026nbspHe continued: “We think the international community should hold Iran, Hezbollah and Lebanon accountable and should act accordingly. Because what you are seeing is not merely a grave violation of our security but a grave\u0026nbspviolation of any nation’s security.”He added that Hezbollah was\u0026nbspusing\u0026nbsp“every third house” in villages in southern Lebanon for\u0026nbsp“aggressive purposes”. He urged the UN security council to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation in its entirety and press for heightened sanctions.At the Israeli border with Lebanon,\u0026nbspLt. Col, Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli army, echoed Mr Netanyahu’s words that the Lebanese authorities had effectively colluded with Hezbollah, which he said also had an influence on UNIFIL.Trew)If there is anything “sensitive” in the area, Hezbollah is able to block further investigations, he claimed.\u0026nbspThe administration of US president Donald Trump has taken a tough\u0026nbspstance against Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran. But it continues to provide support to the Lebanese army, which it sees as a bulwark against Hezbollah’s domination of the country. The US has provided some $1.7bn of aid and equipment to the Lebanese military since 2007.Trew)Lebanon has long complained of almost daily flights over the country by Israeli jets. It\u0026nbspsays this is also a breach of the UN resolution. The Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, said last week that he “took this issue seriously”.He said: “We also do not have aggressive intentions. We are ready to remove the causes of the dispute, but after we obtain a final report and we set out the matters that need to be dealt with.”Mr Netanyahu\u0026nbspdismissed the concerns, saying there was a very big difference between Israel\u0027s actions and the threat from the border tunnels.He later addressed reports that the US would withdraw its troops from\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspafter President Trump said that Isis had been defeated there.Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu\u0026nbspsaid he would study Washington\u0027s decision and its implications for Israel, which is concerned about both Iranian and Hezbollah presence in war-ravaged Syria.In any case, we will make sure to maintain Israel\u0027s security and protect ourselves from this arena, the premier added.\u0026nbspSpokesman Lt. Col.\u0026nbspConricus\u0026nbspsaid that security concerns across Israel\u0027s northern front were behind the decision to launch the tunnel operation this month, and had also deterred the army from launching a\u0026nbspfull-scale\u0026nbspoperation to\u0026nbspthe south in Gaza. \u0026nbspAt the site of the Hezbollah tunnels, Israeli army officials said their operation began four years\u0026nbspago,\u0026nbspwhen Hezbollah leader\u0026nbspSayyed\u0026nbspHassan\u0026nbspNasrallah\u0026nbspvowed to invade the Galilee and they started noticing unusual behaviour in areas near the border.\u0026nbspCommanders said the tunnel at\u0026nbspMetula\u0026nbspstretched 40 metres into Israel and originated in a nearby cement factory in the Lebanese town of\u0026nbspKafr\u0026nbspKela, which had ceased operations\u0026nbspin 2014.\u0026nbspIsrael has threatened to take military action against Hezbollah several times since the last devastating round of conflict in 2006. That battle was sparked by a cross-border raid by Hezbollah to kidnap two Israeli soldiers. The group hoped to use them as bargaining chips in order to pressure Israel to release Lebanese prisoners.Metula on the border between Israel and Lebanon where Israeli forces are working to unearth more passageways (Bel Trew)Instead, the Israelis responded with an\u0026nbspattack that led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians. Forty-four Israeli civilians were also killed by Hezbollah rockets. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHezbollah was founded in the early 1980s with the support of Iran, and spent much of its early existence fighting Israeli troops\u0026nbspoccupying southern Lebanon.Israel invaded Lebanon several times during the country’s 1975-1990 civil war, and occupied much of the south of the country for 22 years.During the occupation, Hezbollah dug extensive tunnel networks across the south of the country. It used\u0026nbspthem to launch ambushes and move around without being\u0026nbspseen by Israeli jets.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That would not have changedshe lost and the Tories picked a new leader.And whatever Jeremy Corbyn says, it wouldn’t changethere was an election and he moved into Number  either.You can’t rule anything out for certain, but most MPs reckon an election is the most unlikely outcome of all.That’s why calling a vote of confidence in the government is a waste of time. Tory MPs won’t risk it and the Ulster Unionists know they will never be more powerful.Anyway, Jeremy told Labour MPs to trigger Article  and set the clock ticking down to departure in March. There isn’t time for an election, the public expect MPs to sort it out and there’s no guarantee it would solve the problem.I asked Jeremy this week what his policy would bethere was an election: would he campaign to stay in, promise another referendum or, after campaigning against the EU for decades, uphold the referendum - but he refused to give any answer at all.And who can be certain he’d win  He should be miles ahead in the polls, but when asked who would make the best Prime Minister, the public still back Theresa May. In fact, in a two-horse race, he comes a distant third behind don’t know.Jeremy seems to think he could negotiate to stay in the single market and customs union, but stop paying our contributions and still have a say over the rules. Who thinks we could get all the benefits without paying a penny Imagine asking to use a gym but refusing to join or even pay – and wanting a say in how it’s run!Let’s face facts: the EU isn’t waiting to give a dferent Prime Minister a better deal. Whether it’s Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, they won’t roll over and give us everything we want.It’s not only Theresa May who says it. Nor even just Juncker. Merkel says the deal can’t be changed.Macron and Ireland’s Taoiseach say so too. Not one EU leader said they are open to renegotiating it.In , % of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Labour heartlands like Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bolsover, Wakefield or Doncaster all voted leave. Here in the West Midlands, people voted to leave in some of the highest numbers of all.In , our manesto promised to uphold the referendum – no s, no buts, no second referendum.Ordinary, decent people who voted leave believed us. Lots of people voted leave to make politicians sit up and listen.With trust in politics at an all-time low, we can’t discount that lightly. Another referendum would take months and there’s no agreement on what the questions would be.I’ve listened to lots of people in Dudley and there’s not much evidence people have changed their minds. Eventhey had, who thinks a narrow remain vote would settle it That’s why I think our choice is between Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all. I joined the Labour Party to fight for ordinary people and their jobs must come first.This week I met Jaguar Land Rover, a world-beating British company employing , British workers.Like manufacturers up and down the country they believe a no deal Brexit would threaten their business and the jobs of people who depend on it.Delays at ports will cost jobs. Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Norway Plus, aka “Remain Minus”, would destroy the Tories as surely as simply scrapping Brexit.It is far more likely to do so than any number of “no-confidence” stunts like the one Jeremy Corbyn has now pulled in his pathetic desperation for relevance.If Theresa May’s withdrawal deal fails — and Remainer Cabinet ministers would rather sacrice Brexit than swallow a No Deal — they’ll just have to quit.It’s not much of a threat.

And some reality TV stars set a good example, just as some of our more traditional public figures leave a lot to be desired.It seemed to me that Love Island winners Jack and Dani were quite a moral couple. They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Often these buildings are heritage.“Its full of adrenaline and adventure, every trip is another adventure and you never know what will happen and where you will end up.“Its some kind of off the beaten path tourism.”Placing at number ten, was Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia, USA, a former prison where medical experiments were claimed to have been conducted on detainees between  – .For number nine, Bob selected the many abandoned castles he had visited, particularly those hidden away from vandals deep in the woods or out of sight.Battleship Island, in Japan, claimed number eight, which was bought by Mitsubishi to extract coal from the sea and an articial city arose.In seventh, was Glück Kingdom, an amusement park based on German designs and buildings, including tributes to Brothers Grimm and their chilling fairy tales.In sixth place, was Nara Dreamland an impressive Disney-inspired amusement park in Japan.Claiming fth position, was a discarded army ing boat off the coast of Portugal, the secret location left them battling with security.Bob considers ship The Colbert to be number four, which has remained in a French port.It was destined to be scrapped until the s when it was converted into a museum, since closing  years ago, new plans are in place to demolish it.In third place was an abandoned oil rig off the Scottish coast of Cromarty Firth, which he and other explorers visited for a weekend.In second place was Fukushima, for its haunting remains of areas where residents according to Bob went “head over heels”.He believes the site is just about bad as it was seven years ago after the nuclear power plant accident.But topping all others for the urban explorer was an abandoned military base that contained space shuttles.Bob spent three days in the dessert in order to reach the location, which he admits was by far the hardest of his adventures, yet the most rewarding.Bob became fascinated with old, history-rich locations that had been forgotten during his teen years.Eventually he would go onto start the YouTube series, Exploring the Unbeaten Path, to document his travels."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457274480.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow emergency debate watch football","story":"The Commons figure – famed for his yell of “Order!

Bercow can do no wrong so long as he helps her and her pals reverse Brexit.God help us that our politicians have sunk this low.Tory Rachel McLean said: “Read my lips – I do not believe him.”Mr Corbyn, who has repeatedly called for an end to personal abuse in politics, scuttled out of the Chamber as Tory big beast Patrick McLoughlin demanded he apologise.The Labour leader was then snapped watching the events unfold on live TV from the safety of the Commons tearoom.MPs grouped around the Speaker’s chair desperately trying to show him a video of the slur so he could rule on it.But he waived it away – saying he would look at it in private.The Speaker later ed and told MPs that while it was “easy to see” why Mr Corbyn’s words might have been construed as “stupid woman”, “nobody can be % certain, that includes professional lipreaders.”But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “The mask slips. Jeremy Corbyn’s abuse of the Prime Minister shows what a reactionary misogynist he is.”Labour veteran Dame Margaret Beckett had tried to defend Mr Corbyn by saying the Tories were guilty of trying to mount an “orchestrated riot”.But Labour’s Jess Philips had earlier admitted thatright the slur was “sexist” and Mr Corbyn “should apologise”.The Prime Minister had infuriated the Labour leader by mocking his on-off threat of tabling a no confidence vote in her Government.To roars of laughter, she said: “I have some advice for the right hon. Gentleman: look behind you. They are not impressed, and neither is the country.”Mr Corbyn’s spokesman insisted there was no need to say sorry as he hadn’t made the attack. And he said the controversy defied belief given the “national crisis” of Brexit.The Labour leader said: “I referred to those who I believe were seeking to turn a debate about the national crisis facing our country into a pantomime as ‘stupid people’.“I did not use the words ‘stupid woman’ about the Prime Minister or anyone , and am completely opposed to the use of sexist or misogynist language in absolutely any form at all.”The row comes just months after Chancellor Philip Hammond was seen mouthing “stupid woman” at a Brexiteer female MP in chamber too.And ex-PM David Cameron was forced to apologise for telling a woman to “calm down dear!” in the Commons back in .Cherie Blair was overhead at Labour conference in  snapping “that’s a lie” when Gordon Brown spoke of how privileged he felt to have worked with her husband –ex-PM Tony Blair.No. claimed she actually said: “I need to get by.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Such a move, he added, would help those most at risk from a No Deal Brexit “to boost them as they transition”.We’re told in a doomsday No Deal ­scenario that all planes will be grounded and the country will be sold no medicines from abroad.It’s even claimed that our food exports will rot in lorries queued up at Dover, while we starve because no food is being imported via Calais, both of which seem unlikely to happen at the same time.To listen to some campaigners, you’d think there are only three kinds of ­relationship with the EU: Membership, paying the massive bills and swallowing endless laws from Brussels a big, one-size-fits-all deal or a smouldering ruin, cut off completely from trade or co-operation.It might be in their interests to pretend so, because they want to try to frighten us into accepting a poor deal or scare us into abandoning the idea of taking back control altogether. But it isn’t true.Most of the world aren’t EU members, after all, and many countries don’t have trade deals with the EU.Brussels’ rule-by-committee means that trade negotiations with the bloc are slow and have to satisfy a dizzying list of ­special interests.Of the deals that countries have struck with the EU,  dferent types have been hammered out.Anyone who claims there is no flexibility in how we manage our relationship after Brexit is not telling the whole story.But even beyond that, among the many countries who trade with the EU without a deal, the reality does not match up to the black-and-white claim that the choice is either full deal or No Deal.In real le, most countries are quite practical and have the power to reach a whole range of smaller agreements with one another that fall short of a trade deal but still bring benefits.They recognise each other’s driving licences or doctors’ qualications, allow mutual access to their air space, or agree to trust each other’s safety tests on goods rather than hold them up for costly extra testing at their ports.Why do they do it  Because it is in both sides’ interests for trade, tourism and le in general to flow as easily as possible.The US does it, the EU does it, every normal state does it — and there’s no ­reason why we and the EU couldn’t do it, too,it isn’t possible to reach a larger agreement for le after Brexit right now.As Theresa May is finding out, some issues might simply be too dficult or controversial for the UK or the EU to give ground on in the next few weeks.But that should not stop us from ­shaking hands on hundreds of other side deals that both sides could agree quite simply, and which would help both sides to square away.That’s what’s called a “managed no deal” — it might not be either our or their dream outcome but it would make le easier while work continues on overcoming the really dficult sticking points.What’s shocking is the way in which this practical approach has been widely ignored for political reasons.Some of the much-touted “worst-case scenario” forecasts for the supposed cost of Brexit rely on the ridiculous assumption that Brussels and Westminster would do literally nothing to reduce any potential problems from No Deal.We’ve been told repeatedly from some quarters that it is simply impossible for the EU to show any flexibility at all with a non-member, even though it has done so in ious cases.At long last, that lie is being exposed. Just as the UK has released its No Deal preparations, the EU is this week ­publishing details of how it would ­handle that situation.And guess what  Brussels wants to strike mutual side deals in which we both agree to respect ious aspects of each other’s rights in order to limit ­disruption and costs.It turns out there is a practical way ­forward after all, and the doom-mongers’ predictions should be taken with a hefty fistful of salt.Of course a good, wide-ranging, lasting deal is still desirable, and we should keep working to agree one.But there are things we can and should do in the meantime.Better that than be rushed into a ­permanent bad deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would seem they agree about nothing. As soon as one minister says something another clown will jump up and insist he’s wrong.It’s like being led by a bunch of hyperactive five-year-olds. If it wasn’t for the fact that the leader of the opposition is a cross between Catweazel and Trotsky we’d have got rid of them long ago.This time the argument is about immigration. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said there are no targets for reducing immigration. The PM immediately responded: “Oh yes there are, baldie.”For once, Theresa May is right. Immigration is a crucial issue and we have been promised time and again — by May herself — that it will be drastically reduced. That’s what the vast majority of the country wants. And the only sensible way to do it is by having targets. You know, something to aim at.We’ve put up with a lot from this Government, maybe too much. If they start backsliding on immigration, that will be it. Down to tens of thousands of people per year, please, as soon as possible. Uncontrolled immigration has made this country almost unrecognisable.We still need to import some talent from overseas. People with good skills and high qualications. What we don’t need are thousands of beggars shoving badly scrawled messages in your face saying “Money Give Now” on the Tube.Nor do we need the thousand upon thousand of unskilled workers picking fruit and veg. Here’s a tip, farmers — pay a decent wage and maybe a few British people will give those jobs a go, huh British businesses have exploited cheap foreign labour for far too long. And the result is an underclass of Eastern Europeans living in desperately squalid conditions, in appalling accommodation.It’s not THEIR fault, by any means. It’s the fault of an immoral system which has seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Cheap EU labour has meant that the wages of the very poorest Britons get undercut. Why on earth the Labour Party supports this exploitation is a total mystery to me.But the other real problem we have is immigration from outside the EU. This easily outnumbers those coming from Europe. I don’t just mean those who say they are refugees but are clearly economic migrants. Although Theresa May could do worse than pledge a halt to that influx, which continues.But we still let in thousands of people from all over the world. They come claiming their brother or cousin lives here and that should give them a right to our benefits and jobs.This has been going on for too long. And it is this immigration which has most changed the face of Britain, in a way many people resent.Here’s the deal, Theresa. Look at Belgium, where the government has just fallen because it ignored the country’s wishes on immigration. So get tough. Put Mr Javid back in his box and set a few realistic targets. Then get to grips with immigration full stop. And maybe we’ll all like you a bit more for it.SOME lesbians are furious.On Coronation Street, the lesbian character Kate Connor tried to seduce . . . a bloke.And the scene got a lot of lesbians up and down the country seething with rage.

Bob, for sure. The sponge with the Bob and the shorts ”At which point, things started getting even weirder for Gino on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show.A programme which, I realise, wasn’t the main television event of the weekend. That was the Strictly Come Dancing final.But so what  It’s Christmas, and after  months largely spent telling you what television shows I don’t like, it seems only fair to celebrate one that I do. Why Simple. Michael McIntyre is one of the very few comedians left on television who realises it’s his duty to make viewers laugh rather than bend and bully them into their left-wing point of view.A noble calling, obviously, but there’d be no point taking this mainstream approachthe resulting show was also cheesy, unprofessional and talked down to its audience.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show falls into none of those traps. Apart from being riotously funny, it’s also clever, charmingly savage at times and ided into three equally slick segments that can all carry an embarrassing musical interlude from Cheryl Tweedy, who stamped around, in elephant leggings, like a mad woman on Saturday’s show.They take it in turns to be the highlight of the show as well. A fortnight ago Bradley Walsh’s send-to-all stunt was the best bit.Last week it was the unexpected-star-of-the-show slot and, at the weekend, it was undoubtedly the Midnight Gameshow with Gino, who had eight stabs before sort of nailing: “SpongeBob with the square pants.”His torment was only just beginning, however, as he was then asked to ID the mystery celebrity singing in his shower.Easy in normal circumstances, but, right on cue, Gino had developed a: “First thing in the morning moment”, and had to shuffle next door with a pillow hiding his embarrassment.If he had the problem, though, Michael McIntyre definitely had the solution.“It’s Sinitta!” he yelled, killing the “first thing in the morning” problem stone dead, which was probably just as well, because he was hugging Boycie from Only Fools And Horses a second or two later.It wasn’t just Gino’s physical responses that were the making of this stunt, though, it was the fact that, having been presented with all this random madness, as well as a goat called Olivia, he asked the single best television question I’ve heard all year.“Are we live ”“LIVE ” responded McIntyre, barely able to contain himself. “It’s one in the morning, Gino.”It’s tempting, then, to describe the whole thing as television perfection.Perfection, though, would’ve involved Gino asking, as he did: “Who comes to houses at this time of the evening ” and McIntyre opening his bedroom cupboard door with a “TA-DA! Paul Young does, Gino.”A Dominatrix on C’s The Sex Business: Pain For Pleasure B Head of Drama at the BBC THE BBC really has created a Sports Personality Of The Year show in the image of its co-host Clare Balding and her all-consuming inferiority complex, hasn’t it A vast and murky event that clearly thinks it’s an adorable, all-inclusive, finger-on-the-pulse, rock ’n’ roll jamboree but is actually a nerdy, uptight, controlling, gender-obsessed, PC quota-thon of the most self-deceiving kind.So Tyson Fury, who has a genuine personality, was excluded from the final six, but Billie Jean King was all over proceedings and England’s Common-wealth Games netball women were apparently the “team of the year”.SPOTY was at its absolute worst, though, trying to do populist, celebrating the all-conquering England World Cup football team , with some BBC-approved patriotism.That is to say, a multi-cultural version of Three Lions, featuring Bhangra dancers, a steel band and a gospel choir, without whom, the BBC presumably imagined, England fans would be goose-stepping round the NEC burning crosses.No one can say for surethis ill-judged segment influenced the final vote, won by Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, of course, but Harry Kane started the night as favourite and ended it third, after something  happened during the song that was so horrendous and disturbing no one who heard the incident can ever mention it or the offender ever again.I hope you’re bloody proud of yourself, David Baddiel.The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote the Keats poem Ode To A Nightingale ”Joe Lycett: “Which American state is home to the Dallas Cowboys ”And  to , Sandi Toksvig: “What five-letter word for a native of one of the Scandinavian countries is also a British name for a root vegetable similar to a turnip ”GOOD Morning Britain, Tuesday Piers Morgan: “The lady who brings our food in has announced she’s quitting.

The ratings were triumphant, the BBC’s very own Eliza Doolittle lted the glitterball and, for the briefest of moments, during her wild dress-swishing paso doble, viewers all thought they glimpsed the true signicance of her gong.She is Stacey Dooley MBE, My Brazilian’s Exposed.

Tfany Wright, , said her sister was a bible-loving young girl until she went off the rails and began dabbling in drink and drugs. Carly Ann Harris, , killed her young daughter and burned her body on a coffee table in her back garden in Tonypandy, South Wales, on June . Tfany, who was the first person Carly called after the killing, explained she once idolised her older sibling. She told the Sun: She was my older sister and I looked up to her. She was fun and we got on well, despite our age dference. [But] She started partying hard when she was  and it never stopped. Booze, cocaine, you name it, she used it - all the time. When she should have been at school, she was out with men in fast cars. Tfany recounted how her young sister stopped attending school at an early age and then began to stay out all night four or five times a week.  Following the birth of Amelia, Carly continued her hard-drinking lestyle much to the dismay of Tfany, who she claims was beyond wild. Tfany says she is still haunted by seeing her beloved nieces charred feet after rushing to the crime scene. She refuses to accept the words of doctors who says Carly Ann was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in the weeks leading up to her daughters killing. Tfany said: I dont for one second believe she was hearing voices or even insane in the truest sense. She certainly never behaved in any way insane before that night. Carly, , was found not guilty by reason of insanity on Monday over the murder of her daughter.  The jury ed a special verdict after hearing that psychiatrists - appearing for both the prosecution and defence - agreed Harris was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. She has been sentenced at Newport Crown Court to a hospital order without limit of time. Speaking outside court, Harris’s mother Jacqui Harris, who was visibly upset, told Wales Online : “It’s bittersweet... I am devastated and beyond words.  During the two-day trial, jurors were told there was no dispute that Harris killed her daughter or about the events leading up to the incident. Amelias teenage brother found her body, wrapped in a sheet, on a table in their garden in Trealaw, South Wales, on June  this year. Harrowing evidence read to the jury suggested she had planned the killing.  On the day of she killed her daughter on June  this year, a friend askedshe and Amelia wanted to visit a play centre the next day. Harris replied: “I can’t come tomorrow. I haven’t got Amelia.” Asked what she meant, the defendant said her daughter would be “in heaven”. That fateful night, her daughter was eating sweets on the sofa. Her mum carried her upstairs and told her: “You’re going to see the angels. See you in heaven.”  Neighbours in Trealaw, Rhondda, reported hearing the childs anguished cries as her mother carried out the horrendous act. She was given a police caution and replied: “Jesus told me to do it. She will be okay. Trust me. I’m not crazy. I promise you I wouldn’t do that to my only girlshe wasn’t ing.” The defendant was taken to Merthyr Tydfil Police Station and said: “I deserve to die. My little girl. The angels said it must be done.” The hearing was before Mr Justice Simon Picken.  He told Harris: A young girl rich in promise met her death at the hands of her mother and in the most horric manner. I am satisfied that you are suffering from a mental health disorder, namely schizophrenia. The intention is that as soon as possible you will be transferred to an appropriate clinic close to home. I am of the opinion...that because of all the circumstances of this cause including the nature of your case, the most suitable method is me making an order under S of the  Act and that is it necessary to protect the public from serious harm.

An image of a sign from the Tesco Extra store, in St Leonards on Sea, was shared on social media by a customer named Rob Lowe last week. Mr Lowe argued that the sign wasnt really acceptable anymore and he felt it set a poor example for his young daughter, who loves unicorns and dolls but also enjoys playing with dinosaurs. He wrote: Come on Tesco. This isnt really acceptable anymore. My daughter loves unicorns and dolls. She ALSO loves robots, dinosaurs, rockets, monsters and Lego. Dont make me have to reassure her that this is ok.  His post has since gone viral, with almost , likes and hundreds of shares. Many people praised Rob for his post and agreed that the supermarket chain should remove the sign from their stores to allow children to pick whatever toy they want to play with, regardless of their gender. A fellow parent branded the sign ridiculous. She said: Ridiculous! Mum of  girls that also like cars, dinosaurs and superheroes. Yes it does matter - its the inherent sexism that girls and women face through their le. This is just for boys.  Another person added: Please Tesco, please remove signs identying toys for girlsor boys . This is , boys and girls must both have the opportunity of a wider choice of toys . You have a responsibility to your customers, me and my extended family included. A third simply wrote: Gender marketing is lazy and sexist. TV writer Donna Fanceschild also couldnt help but notice the grammar mistake in the sign - and claimed Tescos lack of an apostrophe was just more evidence of sexism. She commented: Plus, how is she supposed to get to grips with English grammarTesco omits the crucial apostrophe indicating the possessive   Perhaps they dont think girls should be worrying their pretty little heads about that. However there were many people who thought Rob was overreacting. One Twitter user posted: If I was shopping for my daughter Id find this very helpful. Another slammed people who were offended by the sign.  They said: Has anyone actually met a person thats offended by the absolute nonsense gender fluid bulls*** going on at the moment  Apparently Tesco has a girls toys aisle and people are unhappy  Who are these freaks  Someone  tweeted: Tesco are purely labelling an aisle for stock purposes and the name is irrelevant. Hence the meat aisle has meat and the veg aisle has veg. Who said robots arent girls toys  Or are you assuming that every girls toy must be pink and fluffy  Putting an end to the heated debate, Tesco have admitted that the signs are no longer appropriate. A spokesperson for the company said, “We agree toys are for everyone and removed the ‘Girls’ Toys’ and ‘Boys’ Toys’ signage from our stores several years ago, but it appears that this one was missed. We will have it changed to the new signage as soon as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"how much newest bansky side","story":"NewsHow much newest Bansky on the side of a garage could be worthIan Lewis, , of Port Tablot, Wales first noticed a photo on Facebook and thought \"that looks a bit like my garage\"ShareCommentsByThomas Deacon:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video artwork-wales-confirmed-original-banksy-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe world-renowned artist Banksy has confirmed that a new graffiti piece found on a garage overnight is his. And based on previous sales of his artwork, it could be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.Which could explain why the man who owns the garage in Port Talbot, Wales has spent his time since then guarding it, reports Wales Online .Banksys most recent work before Port Talbot sold for more than pound million. This was even after it was passed through a shredder without warning the moment it was bought at auction. And artwork similar to the new one that appeared on the garage Ian Lewis built himself  years ago has sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds.   Many pieces by the infamously secretive artist have appeared on walls across the world, with some being sold at auction. It isnt known how much Banksy is actually worth, but in  Forbes estimated he was worth million. Its hard to immediately say exactly how much his first Welsh work could be worth, but several of his artworks have fetched huge sums at auction after being cut from where they originally appeared. Banksy confirmed the work was genuine when he posted a video of it on his Instagram account. But before that, people had suspected it was the real thing. In , a Banksy piece called Space Girl and Bird was sold to an American bidder for pound, - that was  times its estimated value. In  another of Banksys graffiti pieces went under the hammer. Slave Labour was a mural painted on the side of a Poundland in London in .   The artwork was a protest against the use of sweatshops to manufacture Diamond Jubilee and London Olympics memorabilia in . In  it was removed and put up for sale in Miami. After an appeal from local residents it was taken down from sale and brought back to the UK. It was later sold at an auction in Covent Garden for pound,. A Banksy mural stenciled on the wall of a Hollywood petrol station sold for pound, at auction, also in . The xft work, entitled Flower Girl, depicts a little girl holding a basket underneath a CCTV camera on a tall stalk. It was snapped up by an anonymous buyer from Los Angeles. In , Sothebys auction house in London auctioned three works by Banksy. One piece went for more than pound,, and two of his other graffiti works and sold for pound, and pound,, well above their estimated prices. Banksy last appeared in the headlines when one of his artworks was shredded into strips moments after it was sold. When a Sothebys auctioneer finished the bidding for a stencil of a girl holding a heart-shaped balloon, it started to slide through its frame and into a shredder. The stunt caused shock in the room and footage of the incident quickly went viral.   The buyer of the piece, a female European collector and a long-standing client of Sothebys, confirmed they would go ahead with the pound.m purchase. Mr Lewis, the -year-old owner of what is now Wales most famous garage, only found out what had happened when he was a picture on Facebook and thought that looks a bit like my garage. I showed it to my son and he agreed, so I went out and had a look and there it was, he said. For the rest of the night, he and his brother-in-law, Wayne Jenkins, took it in turns to keep watch over what is the first Banksy piece in Wales. The police turned up later, and fencing was put up around the garage. Mr Lewiss partner, Julia, said someone had already offered her pound, for the garage. He came up to me and said he would give me poundK and I just laughed, and straight away he said poundK, she said. Banksys most expensive piece, Keep It Spotless, sold for . million in . Samantha Killip, editor of design publication DesignCurial, said: Any artwork will definitely increase the value of the garage, especially considering the time of year and content, which makes it very relevant. I dont think anyone could put an exact value on it, especially as Banksy has expressed a distaste for anyone trying to sell his work, which is not the point of his work.

Janusz Jelen would watch Agnieszka Mogilska while he was at work by logging onto a device on his iPhone. Through a speaker he would ask the mother-of-two to raise her arm to seeshe had any fat and to suggest she wear trousers as he claimed her thighs were shaking. He would also eavesdrop on conversations the -year-old was having with her friends. Machine operator Jelen, , has been banned from contacting Ms Mogilska over his oppressive and degrading behaviour.   Police were called in after Ms Mogilska, a production worker at a lighting company said the she felt like she in a mental hospital with  hours a day surveillance. In a statement she said: As a result of this relationship I do not like my body. Im always covering my roll of fat on my stomach by crossing my arms and do not like the fat on my thighs, despite wearing a size . I sleep less and I am exhausted all the time and have been terried since it ended. I was in a domestic violence relationship before with my ex husband and I cant believe this is happening again. I have been struggling since. At Tameside magistrates court, Jelen was convicted at an earlier hearing of an offence of engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour between November  and October this year.   He was given a  week jail term suspended for a year and issued with a  month restraining order. He was also ordered to complete a  month community order plus  hours of unpaid work. He will pay court charges of pound. The couple, who moved to the UK from their native Poland had been dating for two years but arguments began when Jelen laughed at her about her English pronunciation. Miss Mogilska said: At first I felt very happy and loved but then there were allegations made every day that I am fat and stupid and that I didnt know English. He said my children are stupid and that they will be deported back to Poland because they dont know English. He said I would not get help here, the only help I would get isI got with a man who was English. He gave me psychological abuse. I told him I would rather he had hit me in the face because that would stop hurting - but the words dont.   He observed me through cameras, and he told me to lt my arm to see my fat. I put on shorts when it was hot and he followed me, and told me to put on long trousers because my thighs were shaking. I spoke English but he would laugh at my pronunciation. Several times a day he would say things about me or my children. The camera was installed in July . He had an application on his phone which enabled him to watch the camera from work. When I tried to turn it off he would text me to say to put it back on and would watch all the time. I told him I didnt like the cameras and he said that it was there for my safety because he loves me. I felt like I was in a mental hospital with  hours a day surveillance. When my friends came over he was listening to our conversations.   He didnt like some of my friends and tried to cause conflict between me and them which caused one of them to stop seeing me. He tried to say I had other lovers virtually all the time andI went somewhere, he would say I was seeing other people. I did not pick his friends for him so he cannot pick mine. Everyone has rights to have their freedom. I would go out in the day as I didnt want to see him and he works at night. I would go out and it would cause arguments. He said he would kill my other lover and he followed me when I went to the shop. I asked him to take down the camera and do this so we could split up peacefully like human beings but things got worse. We were arguing non-stop and he would then apologise and give me flowers. I was fed up and went to the police.   I did warn him beforehand that I would and he was laughing at me saying no one would help me. I went to the shop which caused an argument and he said you dont go to the shop at this hour. When I went through the door he said I am going to kill you b*tch and him too. I was walking towards the shop and I was on the phone. On the way back my daughter rang me and said he had left home. I felt like someone was following me or watching me. At first I felt very happy and loved. There was a situation when he came in from work before I went to the police. He came in the bedroom as he thought I was sleeping with someone. He took my arm and pushed me and said who the f*** did you sleep with. He wouldnt let me sleep in his bed or the sofa as he said they belong to him.   Jelen, who is currently single, denied wrongdoing. His lawyer Saul Comish said: The cameras had been installed for over a year and there was no complaint for a while. The comments he made were hurtful and the camera was there recording her in the house. But he never controlled her movements or who she could associate with. There are some cultural elements to this as this type of offence is not common in Poland with this type of behaviour. He accepts what he did, he recognises that the relationship is over and has not made contact with her.   But a probation report read to the court said: I believe there are elements of sexual jealousy as motivation for this offence as he thought she was in another relationship and made threats to the other potential male. There is no insight into his abusive behaviour and to some extent there is some sense of entitlement. There is no previous record of abusive behaviour but the offences were over a prolonged period of time. This was his first long-term relationship so he may do this again unless his thinking is changed. Chairman of the bench Jill Simpson told Jelen: We believe you displayed oppressive treatment intended to degrade her. You will need to mody your behaviour.

The duchess wore the new ring this week on a visit to a nursing home in West London. It is from jewellers Kismet by Milka and said to bring happiness, luck, health and good fortune.A royal fan said: “It’s a Hamsa, protection from the evil eye.” A royal source added: “Meghan is spiritual. She believes in taking time to be in tune with feelings. It’s been a tough time.Perhaps she believes the ring will help with her mindfulness.” The evil eye is a curse or legend believed to be cast by a malevolent glare usually catching a person unaware. Many cultures believe that receiving the evil eye will cause misfortune or injury - and have talismans to protect them.

Evie Lambert, , was born with no left hand and was delighted when a kind-hearted anonymous donor paid for her pound, D-printed arm. Now Evie is looking forward to opening her presents on Christmas morning with her “Frozen” themed arm. She said: “I want to say a big thank you to the donor. It is the best Christmas present ever. “It will really help me to do things that I struggled to do before. It feels really comfortable wearing it and the hand opens and closes like a real hand. I’d love to get make-up for Christmas and now I’ll be able to put mascara on.” Her mum Sally, , of Huddersfield, West Yorks said: “She couldn’t have wished for a better Christmas present.  “If she could have put anything on her wish list it would have been this. The donor is like a real-le Santa. “It gives her ality. It’s the simple things that she’s enjoying doing now – like being able to hold and open a can of pop, brushing her hair, opening a lip balm or putting clothes on a hanger, things that we take for granted.  “When she does it her face just lights up.The most amazing thing will be seeing her open her presents on Christmas day. I’m also going to have her help me wrap Christmas gts.” Sally and her husband Duncan, , found out at the -week scan that Evie had no left hand.  Sally, who also has an eight-year-old son Henry, said: “We have had incidents where people have called her names and there have been stares, but I think she’s built up a resilience to it.” The family heard about Bristol-based Open Bionics at a conference in September.Soon after they got a call to say a donor had paid for a prosthetic for Evie, whose arm was fitted in November.Sally said: “It’s the kind of thing you think happens to other people. It’s amazing. “It’s such an act of kindness – you don’t think these people exist.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast christmas getaway","story":"NewsUK weather forecast:  flood alerts in place with Christmas getaway under threatThe Met Office is predicting days of wet and windy weather for much of the UK - but will it be a white Christmas ShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video white-christmas-year-watch-forecast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThunderstorms and gales are set to hammer parts of Britain, threatening to disrupt Christmas getaways for millions and putting homes and roads at risk of flooding. Violent weather systems are bringing days of heavy rain in the lead-up to the big day next week. There are already  flood alerts in place following weeks of soggy weather that has left some streams swollen and the ground saturated. Wet and windy weather will persist into the weekend, the Met Office says, as millions travel by car, rail or air to visit family over the holiday, or finish their Christmas shopping.  The conditions threaten to disrupt travel and forecasters have warned that some streams could breach their banks and flood homes, businesses or roads. The government has warned Britons to be prepared as flooding is possible. Meteorologist Alex Deakin said people in some places will wake up to a “rumble of thunder” on Thursday morning. Drivers should take care during the commute on rain-slicked roads. The Met Office forecaster told the Express: “All the heavy showers are mulling around an area of low pressure, and there is more where that came from. There will be more low-pressure systems and more weather fronts, which will bring heavy rain.”  The worst conditions are expected in the south-west of England, although heavy rain will move northwards through the day. Heavy showers are likely during the evening commute. The Met Office said Friday will be grey and wet for most of the UK, with gales around coasts. Its been dubbed Frantic Friday because schools break up that day and millions of Britons will begin their Christmas getaways. The AA is expecting  million vehicles on the roads, and the RAC is predicting the most congested getaway rush for years. Those trying to fly into or out of Gatwick Airport on Thursday faced major disruption, with its lone runway closed due to drones buzzing over the airfield.  Saturday will see bright spells and scattered showers as many people make their last-minute shopping trips. There will be further outbreaks of rain from Sunday through the start of next week, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Christmas Day will be mild in most places, with increasing amounts of dry weather, the Met Office said. Is there a flood alert in your area  Twenty-four flood alerts are in place across the country this morning - although these are being updated on a regular basis.The current warnings are:North East EnglandUpper River Ouse North West EnglandUpper River Derwent, Stonethwaite Beck and Derwent Water  The MidlandsBow and Piddle Brook River Leadon Catchment River Lugg south of Leominster River Wye in Gloucestershire River Wye in Herefordshire South East England Cuckmere River Loxwood Stream River Beult from Pluckley and Bethersden to Hampstead Lock at Yalding River Rother and its tributaries from Turks Bridge to the Royal Military Canal Upper River Stour Western Rother South West EnglandEast Somerset Rivers Lower Avon and tributaries Lower Frome and tributaries Mid Bristol Avon Area Middle Stour and tributaries River Yeo and River Parrett Moors around Muchelney and Thorney Rivers Clyst and Culm and their tributaries South East Somerset Rivers, Upper Reaches South Somerset Rivers, Upper Reaches Upper Bristol Avon Area Upper Stour and tributaries Met Office five-day forecast Thursday Some dry and sunny spells today, but with blustery showers from time to time. The showers will be heaviest and most frequent in the north and west, with southern and eastern parts dry for a good portion of the day. Thursday night Heavy rain arriving in southwest England and Wales later, spreading into the rest of England, Wales and Northern Ireland during the early hours. Scotland seeing scattered showers and some frost.  Friday Grey and wet for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with gales around coasts. A dry spell across southern England and Wales, but more rain later. For Scotland, sunshine and showers. Saturday to Monday Saturday bright spells and scattered showers. Sunday and Monday cloudy with outbreaks of rain for many, although perhaps drier in the north, especially on Monday. Will it be a white Christmas  The Met Office says: There is low confidence in the forecast as we head into the Christmas period. However, central and western areas are more likely to see cloudy skies and outbreaks of rain on Christmas Eve, whilst it will most likely be drier and brighter where. Meanwhile, many will most likely see a mild day on Christmas Day itself, with increasing amounts of dry weather. Thereafter, as we continue towards the end of the year, southern parts will probably see a good deal of dry weather, although with this settled weather comes an increased risk of overnight fog and frost. Northern parts, meanwhile, look set to see more changeable weather, with showers or longer spells of rain at times.

Presenter Sylvie Tellier was interviewing some of the young women in the dressing room for channel TF when it happened. But in the background Miss Aquitaine, Carla Bonesso, appeared topless while another contestant had her breasts barely covered. Ms Tellier, who is the national director of Miss France Organisation, described the incident as a major gaffe.  She said: This should not have happened. This is a big mistake on our part and it has spoiled this show a little. And the unfortunate Miss Bonesso, , added: I was not quite naked, it was an accident. But TF did not manage its cameras well, it was not at all professional. She was asked on social media whether she would be pursuing a complaint against the broadcaster and replied: I do not know.  The topless footage sparked controversy on Twitter where one user pointed out it could have potentially undermined the whole contest. The user said: Normally. it is forbidden for Miss France winners to show their breasts so what happensthe poor girl whose breasts were seen on television is elected the winner Would she be immediately disqualied because of this   And another contributor added: Breasts during Miss France!!! Frankly the camera work behind the scenes is limited. Franck Broqua, the director of the television coverage, said he had wanted a camera behind the scenes to be closer to the candidates as they prepared for the event. It had worked well in rehearsals but the cameraman had moved during the live event giving him a wider camera angle.  Mr Broqua said he believed he had reacted quickly enough but added that he was sorry for the regrettable live incident. TF has removed the topless footage from the online version of the show available on streaming services. Miss Tahiti, Vaimalama Chaves, , was crowned Miss France  in the pageant. Miss Bonesso was not named among the top five contestants.

The minister did not seem to realise that many living in my constituency donrsquot feel they have benefited from the city deal and this must change.In his question, Mr Stone said: ldquoA whole shed load of money has been spent in Inverness but precious little has been spent in the out laying areas. That is surely not in the spirit of the deal and should there not be an audit of this sort of deal in the future Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Elizabeth Truss, replied: ldquoWe are doing city deals right across Scotland they are having huge benefits for the local economy.A similar argument was restated in the council chamber by Derek Macleod, the member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh who held up a picture of some of the investment projects.He said: ldquoA picture tells a thousand words, that map tells a story, it is time for a region deal as opposed to a city-region deal because out with Inverness and the Inner Moray Firth you could list on one hand the tangible contributions of this programme.Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson responded by saying there were benefits but that more bodies had to come forward to apply for funding rather than waiting for it to be handed out.She said: ldquoWe have got ultra fast broadband ndash the only council in Scotland to get that ndash so we can [help] Inverness, Fort William, Wick and Thurso.

Stevie’s had a big part to play in that.“There’s no doubt Sam’s game is in a good place.“We’ve been searching for that in the top end of the pitch, for those goals to come.”Cosgrove wasn’t alone in netting against McIntyre’s sorry side, with impressive young winger Connor McLennan scoring a volleyed fourth – after he’d set up the opener – and centre-back Andy Considine getting a double of his own from set-plays.Calvin Miller had grabbed a long-range consolation for the team in dark blue before Considine wrapped things up.McInnes added: “ goals in three games now shows you the importance of having the added threat from everyone at the top end of the pitch.“It’s been a good spread of goals.”The manager was delighted at the ruthlessness of Aberdeen’s performance against Dundee, where the visitors, clearly low of confidence, were ferociously pressed and forced into surrendering the ball time and again.He said: “I’m really pleased. From the outset the players’ appetite for the game was clear.“We played with a real edge and intensity.“ Shinnie andFerguson had to do the job in thereagainst three midfielders, but we wanted to carry the threat of May and Cosgrove once we could get to their back four.“Both were very potent in their work carrying that threat for us.“We had good moments in the game. The second goal just before half-time helps us.“We spoke about trying to keep the intensity for the first - minutes of the second half and to go and win the second half.“Getting the next couple of goals allows us to make the changes because of the schedule – it allows us to getMcGinn off, to get May off, Cosgrove off.“The only little blemish was losing the goal. But to score five at home to one of Jim’s teams, who are always well organised and go toe-to-toe with you, I’m really pleased.”Aberdeen have now won four of five league games this month and climbed from the bottom six not so long ago to one point behind Rangers and Kilmarnock, although the Gers play Hibs tonight.They are level on points with Celtic, who play Motherwell tonight and have another game in hand, which means the next two Premiership matches for the Dons – Heartson Saturday and Celtic on Boxing Day, both in the Granite City, could help tip the balance for the rest of the campaign.Of the Reds’ recentto the upper part of the league, where they have finished second behind the Hoops for the past four years, McInnes said: “I’d rather be top, but considering where we were a few weeks ago, we set ourselves a target before the Livingston game to go and win the next four games.“We felt it was important to get to  points after  games.“That’s the halfway stage and normally where we are. We’re always on course to break  points.“We had a lot of work to do and points to gain, but we’ve got nine out of nine now and we’ll go and try to get the next three available on Saturday.”The boss confirmed Gary Mackay-Steven, who was knocked out in the - Betfred Cup final loss to Celtic at the start of the month, still has a chance of aon Saturday after suffering concussion.Mikey Devlin, sidelined with a foot injury, will not be back playing until January after seeing a specialist in London this week."},{"url":null,"title":"merits of playing two up front underscored","story":"Aberdeen#s - win over Dundee at Pittodrie was straightforward – and, regardless of the opposition, underlined the merits of playing two up front.Derek McInnes’ Dons have scored  goals in three games now, with big striker Sam Cosgrove hitting form at the right moment and bagging four of those.I’m delighted for him – his goals were great – as well as Stevie May, his partner in crime.May put in another tireless sht and, but for a couple of blocks, could have also had another goal to follow up his penalty in the - win over St Mirren at the weekend.Special mention must also go to Connor McLennan, who has excellent ability on the ball to beat men and get a cross in.I’d have loved to have had him on the wing in my prime sending the ball across to me.He’s got a bright future.Everybody worked their socks off against Jim McIntyre’s Dees, not giving the visitors – low on confidence and bottom of the Premiership – a moment to settle.It reminded me of Hibs’ win over Celtic at the weekend.The quality of opposition was chalk and cheese, but you’ve got to get in teams’ faces and show them they are in a game every minute.Teams with plenty of time can stroll about the park and pick passes.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens back in control and give everyone the chance to decide whether the Prime Minister’s deal is good for the country andthe UK should leave the EU on those terms.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen researchers reveal conflicting attitudes to hen harriers","story":"Researchers from Aberdeen University have released a new study into attitudes towards hen harriers.Teams from Aberdeen University and Bangor University have worked together on the study which has been published in People and Nature.The birds are still killed illegally on grouse moors, despite being protected since .Organisations with a connection to field sports or nature conservation were surveyed to find out attitudes towards the birds.The study highlights conflict between views on management of wildle.Professor Steve Redpath, of Aberdeen University, said: “It seems unlikely conservation organisations would be willing toto the negotiating table unless the illegal killing of hen harriers stops.#Plans to minimise the impact of harriers on grouse brood management was put forward, but as we see, it is very controversial.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home dec15","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  Lovely laidback ladies Ruby and Sophie are looking for a forever home together.The pair, who are  years old, still enjoy their walks but also like a sofa day too.Someone who is at home most of the time would be ideal for these girls, who are likely to follow their new owner around the home.The pooches, who are not suited to a household with children, will need to be kept on a hypoallergenic diet. vw, px\"  Gorgeous girl Freya is looking for a new owner who can take her on lots of country walks.The six-year-old, who has been neutered, has previously beem around children and will need an owner with experience of the breed.Freya is also used to other dogs but can can be quite vocal with them until she gets to know them.Can you give her a home  vw, px\"  Handsome lad Louie is on the prowl for a new home where he can get outdoors to explore.Although six-month-old Louie can be quite a feisty boy, he also adores receiving cuddles.And when it comes to playtime, this cute cat has lightning reflexes.It is not knownLouie has previously been around other animals or children.Can you give him a home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/01/P-9d5daefd-759d-48d7-aca6-7e7a0e9eaf70-100x56.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"inspectors praise for north east nursery","story":"A north-east nursery has been praised by inspectors.The Care Inspectorate visited Fyvie Primary School on November  and said in a report: “Staff were respectful and nurturing in their interaction with the children.”They rated the care, support and environment of the nursery as “very good” – the second best of six possible ratings.A parent told inspectors: “Staff are amazing.

We have the Scottish Government laying down conditions around ring-fencing of certain parts of the budget.“We will have to take all of that into account.”However, Ms Forbes said the budget settlement puts the power in local councils’ hands.She said: “I think for me the important aspect is the local authorities have the freedom to decide on their own spending priorities.“They have to fulfil statutory obligations and there is additional spend on the services which people who live and work and play here in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire will use.”Ms Forbes added the Scottish Government has set its budget in the backdrop of austerity from the Westminster Government, with a cut to the Scottish budget.And Stephen Flynn, city SNP group leader, said: “It’s unsurprising to see the administration have dusted off their annual budget quotes while once again completely ignoring their inability to get Cosla to change the funding formula in place.“Not only that, but they ignore the tens of millions of pounds worth of overspends and delays that have been incurred on their watch.“Folk aren’t daft, they know this administration has a truly woeful record when it comes to meeting budget constraints.“I only wish they spent more time on getting their own house in order.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your handy guide to north east council services over christmas and new year","story":"North-east councils have announced the opening times for libraries as well as the pick-up times for bins, and the Evening Express has compiled it into one handy guide for you.City residents whose bins are usually collected on Christmas Day or New Year’s Day will have their rubbish picked up the Saturday before, either December  or December .Crews operate at reduced levels over the Christmas period so pick-up times may dfer from usual.The recycling centres in the city will be open as usual every day except for Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.Christmas trees can be recycled at the usual centres, collected with the usual brown bins between January  and , or placed beside a communal bin.City libraries will be closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day as well as from Hogmanay to January .

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

Ferguslie were much more clinical and added a further two goals to give themselves a comfortable - lead at the break.Into the second half and despite some better passages of play the match was killed as a contest when Luke Kalache was ordered off for handling the ball outside the area. Young Jake Weir took his spot in goal with young McGeachy making way as the visitors were reduced to ten men. From the resulting free kick, Fergulie’s Andy Turner found the bottom corner to make it -.The home side added a fth before the ten men responded with Ryan Caskie converting a Colin Weir corner to make it -.Star were caught out again late on as Ferguslie added another two goals to make the scoreline a harsh looking - at full time.This was a stern lesson for Star, although the performance of young Neily Russell, who came on late on and looked composed up front, will give Naisby optimism.On Saturday December , Red Star are at home where another tough test against Hillington awaits.

A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million. This would be a considerable amount at any time, but coming after years of funding cuts already, it will demand particularly dficult decisions to be made.Councillor Aileen Morton, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, added: #This local government budget is extremely disappointing for the council, our residents and communities. The Scottish Government provides around  per cent of councils’ funding so another . per cent reduction will have signicant impact. It means we must focus on what we as a council have a duty to deliver, and reduce the work we do that’s additional to that.#We have to consider, unfortunately, even those services that are valued,they are not a statutory requirement.#Our priority will be as always to make the best possible use of whatever level of funding we receive, We must set our budget in February .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing. Why have showering, changing, and laundering facilities not been provided in the interim ”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCrosshouse HospitalAyrKilmarnockAutismDrugsNHS ScotlandEast Ayrshire CouncilPolice ScotlandIndy ref Health and pensionsScottish Government"},{"url":null,"title":"former air traffic control boss","story":"NewsFormer air traffic control boss at Glasgow Prestwick Airport jailed for raping womanElliott Summers was found guilty of sexually assaulting the woman.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSummers was an air traffic control boss at Prestwick\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA FORMER airport boss was today jailed for six years for raping a woman in his home, writes Wilma Riley. Elliott Summers, , of Bellesleyhill Road, Ayr, was found guilty after trial of the rape of a -year-old woman on July , last year. Judge Lord Kinclaven told first offender Summers: “You have been found guilty of a serious sexual offence and there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.” Summers, who was placed on the sex offenders register, worked at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as general manager for air traffic control and then in  became managing director at Norwich Airport in England. Recently he was working as a practice manager at a GP surgery in Glasgow. Solicitor advocate Murray Macara QC said: “He maintains he did not rape this woman and maintains that whatever sexual conduct took place was of a limited nature and was consensual. Mr Macara handed over a dozen testimonials from work colleagues of Summers. The QC said that his client objected to some of the comments in the background report compiled on him which referred to him a displaying toxic masculinity” and described him as a misogynist. Mr Macara said that Summers was highly thought of at work. He went on: “He worked as an air traffic controller and had senior managerial roles at two airports. During the trial Summers victim told of how they met online and then she visited his cottage. She took a bottle of wine for him and bottled water for herself. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she arrived around .pm to pm and Summers, who was drunk, grabbed her and forcefully kissed her at the door. He told her that he had been drinking at the pub since .pm and she said he was so drunk he was unable to work the remote control for the television. Summers, then put his hand inside her bra, made a disparaging comment about her nipples and suggested that she looked older than . She said took her hand and took her into the bedroom which was pitch black and added: “I tried to push him away with both hands. I repeatedly said No, this is not happening.” When Summers fell asleep his terried victim managed to get out of the bed and get dressed. The womans daughter said her mother was distressed and crying and told her she had been raped and police were called. When quizzed by police Summers denied all responsibility for any rape and said that there was consensual sexual intercourse that evening. The GP practice in Glasgow where Summers was employed as a practice manager said: His employment was terminated at the end of last month after his conviction for rape.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSex crimeAyrCourtsAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girvan town set revamp new","story":"NewsGirvan town set for revamp with new CCTV to be installedIn recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month.ShareByPippa Smith:,  DEC NewsCllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the community \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGirvan’s thoroughfare is set to get a revamp of new CCTV cameras.

He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"leadsom-insists-managed-no-deal-brexit-is-possible-amid-cabinet-divisions","story":"Andrea Leadsom has insisted a managed no-deal Brexit is possible, as

Most that die in Laplandrsquos forests are never found.

And despite what Irsquove just said about goodwill, I have not one iota of sympathy for Theresa May and her current predicament.Itrsquos interesting, isnrsquot it, how this narrative around feeling sorry for the Prime Minister has grown  The ldquopoor Theresa mantra reached a full head of steam last week, of course, as the extreme Brexiteers in her party finally moved in for the kill with their vote of no confidence, after stalking her for months.In the media coverage during the build-up to Wednesdayrsquos vote, and in the tone of the reaction to her victory, I was struck by the number of folk who went on and on ndash and on - about how sorry they felt for Mrs May.Itrsquos become clear large sections of the public have become increasingly, indeed worryingly, impressed by the Prime Ministerrsquos handling of the Brexit debacle, seeming to view the blank look on her face as a comforting, praiseworthy signal to us, the plebs, that she knows what shersquos doing.Irsquom not fooled for a minuteand neither should you be. Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together. But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9193528.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gloom-for-200000-from-eu-who-came-to-live-in-scotland","story":"Many have built their entire lives herein Scotland, with friends, family, and a career.

After her deal is defeated in mid-January, she will delay and preicate, let the days and hours tick by until a hard Brexit becomes an imminent reality. She will then force Parliament to accept her deal to avoid no deal. From her point of view it makes sense. The reality is that Labour risks colluding with this irresponsible brinksmanship. It has been playing around with presentational ersions to avoid having to make any strategic decision about unblocking Brexit.The Prime Minister batted away Jeremy Corbynrsquos contrived attempt to move a confidence motion in her personally, but not her Government ndash a ldquomotion of no consequence as itrsquos been called. A properly tabled confidence motion, which Labour knows is the only one that would have been put to a vote, would likely have been defeated as Tory MPs united around their beleaguered leader. But at least this would have moved Parliament and the nation on.It would have made crystal clear that an early General Election is off the table ndash which of course is why Labourrsquos bottled it. Instead we have a crippling stasis lasting now well into the New Year. Thereafter, a hair-raising game of chicken, in which the stakes are the very peace of the realm, as confirmed yesterday by the Governmentrsquos proposal to deploy , troops on the streets and ports in March.I keep hearing lamentations from Labour supporters who find themselves yearning for theof Tony Blair. The discredited former PM is the only politician who seems to be offering anything remotely resembling leadership right now. He has been perambulating around Europe, much to Mrs Mayrsquos displeasure, urging EU leaders to take seriously the possibility of the repeat referendum he advocates. He brushes aside the argument that this would be a betrayal of democracy. Nonsense, he says: a referendum IS democracy ndash the only democratic solution when Parliament is deadlocked.:SNP and Lib Dems put down no-confidence motion in Theresa Mays GovernmentIn one sense Labour is more united than ever. Both the youth wing, and the activists of Momentum, are ardent Remainers and desperate for another referendum. In this they are joined by the old Blairite Labour Right, led by former shadow cabinet luminaries like Chukka Umunna and Hilary Benn. But the old Labour Left, who by an accident of history happen to occupy the Labour leadership right now, are Eurosceptics in the proper sense of the word. Mr Corbyn says he voted Remain in , but Labourrsquos  manesto made a clear promise to deliver Brexit and end free movement.Labour only really opposes Mrs Mayrsquos version of Brexit because it doesnrsquot protect workplace rights and doesnrsquot guarantee friction-free trade. Mr Corbyn says he wants a General Election so that he can go off and negotiate a version of the Withdrawal Agreement that doesnrsquot have these limitations. But everyone knows this is pure fantasy ndash an insult to the intelligence of the voters. Eventhere were time for a General Election and a renegotiation before March, it would be futile. The Withdrawal Agreement is a legally drafted document, negotiated over two and half long years, and has been endorsed by all  remaining states. Unless the UK is prepared to lt its red lines and stay in the single market with Norway, which Labour isnrsquot prepared to do, then there is nothing more to be said. The Irish backstop would remain because Labour is committed to avoiding a border.The logic of Labourrsquos position should surely be to wrest what concessions it can from Mrs May about workplace protections and the Good Friday Agreement and then back her amended deal. The Withdrawal Agreement is not, after all, the future trade agreement with the European Union. It only sorts the immediate problems of paying the orce bill and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens, here and in Ireland. The Political Declaration on the future relations with the EU that accompanied the Withdrawal Agreement is much more contentious. Itrsquos a vague wish list in which the only definitive red line is on free movement, insisted upon by Mrs May. Labour should surely be using its influence now to ensure that the future trade deal keeps Britain in that ldquopermanent customs union and single market alignment that Mr Corbyn always talks about.Now, many Scots will be appalled at this suggestion that Labour should back Mrs May, and I hasten to add that it is not my own position. I would never have left the European Union in the first place. Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and has been treated abominably in the Brexit process. Scotlandrsquos legitimate interests in securing a Brexit that doesnrsquot damage Scottish economic and civic le have been peremptorily dismissed by Westminster. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos proposals for Scotland to have similar regulatory alignment with the EU, as accepted for Northern Ireland, were batted away without a thought.The UK Governmentrsquos subsequent legal jiggery-pokery has damaged the constitutional standing of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, under which the Scottish Parliament had to consent to Westminster legislation that cuts across its devolved powers, has been exposed as a sham. No backstop there. The Scottish Parliamentrsquos Continuity Bill, which sought to ensure that Holyrood retained its devolved powers as they were repatriated from Brussels, was disposed of by retrospective legislation which would have shamed a banana republic. Scotlandrsquos requests for devolution of responsibilities like immigration have also been ignored.But the unfortunate reality is that Scotland is irrelevant right now. The Westminster parties are entirely preoccupied with their own Brexit psychodrama. After the dust settles, sometime around , Scots will have to make their own decision about whether to remain or leave the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-urge-devolved-administrations-to-pull-together-to-back-her-brexit-deal","story":"The Prime Minister is set to call on Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford - the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales - as well as representatives of the Northern Ireland Civil Service to listen to businesses and get behind her Withdrawal Agreement.:Iain Macwhirter: The logical stance for Labour would be to back Mays dealHer message to back the deal comes after her Cabinet agreed to ramp up preparations for the UK crashing out of the European Union without an agreement, and Mrs May will also update the leaders on the contingency plans.Ahead of the meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committeethis afternoon, the Prime Minister said: \"I am confident that what we have agreed delivers for the whole of the UK.\"This deal honours the result of the referendum - taking back control of our money, laws and borders, protecting jobs and livelihoods, and freeing the UK to strike new trade deals with countries around the world.\"Thats why it is more important than ever that the devolved administrations get behind this deal and listen to businesses and industry bodies across all four nations who have been clear that it provides the certainty they need.\"From the Scottish Fishermens Federation and Diageo, to Airbus and Manufacturing NI, business and industry right across the UK want to us to deliver this deal as it gives them the clarity and stability they need to protect jobs and living standards.\"So my message is clear: now is the time for us to pull together and harness our efforts behind this deal and build a bright future for people all across the United Kingdom.\":Gloom for , from EU who came to live in ScotlandBut Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged the Prime Minister to \"face up to reality\", saying jobs and living standards are \"on the line\".She said: \"Postponing the vote in the House of Commons on her bad Brexit deal just means delaying defeat and wasting precious time.\"It would be unforgivableTheresa May was trying to run down the clock to Brexit day.\"She must immediately inform the EU that she will seek their approval for an extension of article MPs reject her deal in January.\"This will allow time for an alternative way forward to be found, preferably another referendum on EU membership\"With  days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU, the UK Government must stop threatening the disaster of No Deal, and start putting peoples jobs and living standards first.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lockerbie-bomb-investigators-closing-in-on-two-libyans-suspected-of-being-behind-atrocity","story":"The Times reports US and Scottish investigators are hopeful they will get permission to interview Abdullah al-Senussi - believed to have been behind the atrocity - and Abu Agila Masud, the bomb maker.Both men are held in a Libyan prison.:Lockerbie bombing: Case couldto court  years on from disasterIt comes after Fayez al-Sarraj, the countrys UN-backed prime minister, said his government is willing to extradite Hashem Abedi, wanted for questioning in Britain after the attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in which  people were killed.Hashems brother, Salman Ramadan Abedi, was the suicide bomber who carried out the Manchester attack.:Special services to be held in Lockerbie and US to mark  years since air disasterThe assurances have given police involved in the Lockerbie investigation encouragement, according to the newspaper.It said officers described Libyas response to diplomatic approaches as \"positive and constructive\".Abdul Baset Ali al-Megrahi was the one person convicted for the bombing.

It is time for the UK Government to listen to the needs of Scotland and act accordingly,\" she said.Ms Sturgeon cited estimates that real GDP in Scotland would be approximately . per cent lower by  because of the Brexit-driven reduction in migration, equivalent to a fall of pound billion in Government revenue over the period.\"This, she declared, ldquois an unacceptable price for Scotland to pay.\"However, David Mundell defended the proposal, saying: \"The Immigration White Paper provides a strong foundation for delivering what businesses and iniduals in Scotland want: a UK-wide immigration system with the flexibility to meet the needs of all sectors of the economy in all parts of the country.\"Our -month engagement with business will allow us to develop a future immigration system which addresses the specic economic and demographic needs in Scotland, explained the Scottish Secretary.He stressed: \"At the same time, the Scottish Government must do more to shoulder their share of the responsibility for making Scotland an attractive place for people to live, work and put down roots.\"Following publication of the immigration proposals, the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland called for \"an urgent rethink\", warning the plans would have a disproportionate impact on firms north of the border.Andrew McRae, its Scotland Policy Chairman, said: \"The UK Governments obstinate approach to immigration is a clear threat to many of Scotlands businesses and local communities.\"These proposals will make it nigh impossible for the vast majority of Scottish firms to access any non-UK labour and the skills they need to grow and sustain their operations.\"FSB research has found that small businesses in Scotland are more reliant on labour and skills from the EU compared to the UK as a whole.\"Requiring employers to grapple with what is currently a clunky and costly immigration system to hire international talent will have signicant implications for the small business community in Scotland. The risk is this makes small business owners into de-facto immigration officers, said Mr McRae.He added: \"The proposed system also puts a lot of faith on Whitehall officials to predict the skills needs of a Dundonian manufacturer or a Highland hotelier years in advance. This reliance on state central planning is not the hallmark of a dynamic, responsive trading environment.\"Willie Rennie for the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the Governmentrsquos immigration plans would ldquobring chaos, not control, noting how ldquoScotland depends on immigration, from our farms to our NHS\".Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative backbencher Kirstene Hair also expressed concerns about the pound, salary threshold and low-skilled sectors.\"Many healthcare, hospitality, agricultural and fisheries jobs do not meet the salary floor or skill level in the proposals outlined, which could prevent these vital workers coming to the UK to work and contribute to our economy.The Angus MP said that she would be calling for ldquoexemptions where there were shortages in those important sectors to ensure ldquoour future immigration policy addresses specic economic and demographic needs in Scotland and across the UK\"."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-continues-to-seek-further-assurances-from-eu-on-backstop-but-nicola-sturgeon-says-efforts-nebulous","story":"As opposition parties continued to complain that the Prime Minister had put off the meaningful vote on her Brexit Plan to the week beginning January  ndash just days before the January  deadline in the Withdrawal Agreement ndash she told reporters on a visit to Heathrow Airport: \"Were talking to the EU about some further assurances to assuage the concerns that MPs had on a particular issue in the Withdrawal Agreement and were working on that and Parliament will have a vote in January.\"I want to see us leaving the European Union with a good deal but until were sure that thats been ratied, it makes sense, its reasonable for Government to make contingency arrangements for a no deal and thats exactly what were doing.\"In PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn tore into the PMrsquos strategy, using a string of heated putdowns. Accusing her of wasting pound billion on no-deal contingency planning, he said: ldquoWhat the Prime Minister is doing is a criminal waste of money.ldquoShe is recklessly running down the clock, all in a shameful attempt to make her own bad deal look like the lesser of two evils.The Labour leader added: ldquoWith rising crime, , fewer police on our streets, , vacancies in our national health service, and the worst performance last month of any November on record, how can the Prime Minister justy wasting that money on no deal, which cannot and will not happen Mrs May replied by insisting that until a deal was ratied, the responsible position of any government was to put in place contingency arrangements for a no-deal.ldquoBut I repeat thathe wants to ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal, he has to put into practice what he is saying and actually vote for a deal, she declared.Later, the PM chaired a plenary session of the inter-governmental Joint Ministerial Committee, urging the devolved administrations to ldquopull together behind her Brexit Plan.The First Minister, who attended, insisted the ldquourgent priority now is to secure support for an option other than the PMrsquos proposal or a no-deal outcome, which is why an Article  extension has become essential.Afterwards she told reporters: \"Its beyond me that any prime minister would want to have as her legacy turning the UK inwards and making it less open and welcoming to people from the rest of the world.\"Askedthe PM had spelt out what was being done to progress getting a deal acceptable to Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: \"It was a wee bit nebulous.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Most cash was paid to Scottish wind farms, with some earning more than £m a month for not supplying power.Whitelee and its extension on the outskirts of Glasgow, the biggest onshore wind farm in the UK, has received almost a fth of the entire pot since , with payments totalling more than £m to date.Meanwhile, the MW Clyde scheme, near Abington in South Lanarkshire, has raked in more than £m and the Grfin, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire, nearly £m. The amount paid out has been rising annually, despite a new transmission cable to export power from Scotland south of the Border.The fees, known as constraint payments, are paid for by households across the UK.Anti-wind campaigners say spending on constraints has got “completely out of control”, and described expansion of the industry as “reckless”.Lyndsey Ward, who lives in the Highlands, said: “The constraints situation is completely out of control. The Scottish Government is recklessly approving more and more turbines to be connected to a grid that has little hope of managing any power they produce. “The result is an ever-increasing number of turbines have to be switched off and it is the consumer who pays. “Industry also has the wind costs on their energy bills and they add that on to the goods and services they sell us.” The £. billion Western Link interconnector, which became operational last year, runs  miles underwater from Hunterston in Ayrshire to Connah’s Quay in North Wales.It was hoped by exporting power to England and Wales the cable would cut levels of compensation paid to energy firms when Scottish turbines have to be shut down because supply outstrips demand.But faults have seen the cable – a joint project between network operators National Grid and Scottish Power Transmission – unable to operate at full capacity until last month.So far there seems no reduction in payouts compared to the same time last year.Dr John Constable is director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity which first exposed constraint payments to wind generators and publishes data on the costs.He said: “No-one expected the Western Link to be a complete solution to wind power constraint costs, but the continuing level of payments is strikingly high – £m in November, £.m in December so far – raising the question as to whether this very expensive interconnector represents value for money.”Energy regulator Ofgem approved the Western Link project following a cost-benefit analysis that showed it would reduce consumer bills.A spokeswoman for National Grid said: “The Western Link project is playing a vital role in reinforcing the existing UK transmission system … The project is in the early days of operation but will signicantly reduce the levels of constraint payments being made to wind generators.” A spokesman for Ofgem added: “Ofgem sets National Grid, as electricity system operator, strong financial incentives to manage constraint costs efficiently. Overall these costs are less than  per cent of a typical household electricity bill.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845340.1545122767!/image/image.jpg","title":"a brexit carol theresa may haunted by three ghosts paris gourtsoyannis","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...As she tries to save her Brexit deal, what would happenTheresa May got a ghostly visit or three this Christmas, wonders Paris Gourtsoyannis.Theresa May’s Brexit deal was dead. Dead as a doornail.Yet of all the good days in the year, on Christmas eve the Prime Minister still sat in her Downing Street office, the door open that she might keep an eye on her clerks.Gavin Barwell and Robbie Gibb sat in the light of a very small fire, barely visible in the shadows cast by piles of draft Withdrawal Agreements, assurances and side-letters, backstops to the backstop, and flowcharts pointing at dferent fates for May.Hands freezing, backs bent, they scratched out desperate plans to force her deal through the Commons. Scurrying over the floorboards in the dark, damp corners, whips searched for votes.May’s phone vibrated and cast a shaft of light into the darkness – a text. “You don’t have to do this, Theresa. I’m just trying to help. Merry Christmas, TB.”“Nothing has changed!” she wheezed, firing back: “Keep Brexit in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”Leaving her clerks to their work, May climbed the stairs to her apartment to take her melancholy dinner and try and unwind in front of a relaxing episode of ‘Naval Crime Investigation Service ’.No sooner had she nodded off than May was awoken by a clanking, thudding sound on the stairs, growing closer, and louder, relentless and doom-laden, like thecomment section.Through her closed bedroom door a figure appeared, and the blue TV light crackled and leapt as though it cried: “I know him Nick Timothy’s ghost!”The same beardy face, the same name. The chain her former special adviser drew was clasped about his middle and dragged bundles of newspapers.“But Nick,” May whimpered, cowering, “you’re in chains.”“It is required of every man,” Timothy replied, “thatthey are not self-aware in le, then it is condemned to be after death.”The spectre raised a cry and shook its columns. “I wear the chain I made in Downing Street,” it said “I made it line by line, blame by shted blame.“I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate,” Timothy went on. “You will be haunted by Three Spirits.”May awoke with a start, but before she could convince herself it was a dream, light flashed and the curtains of her bed were drawn. She found herself before a strange figure, with a face like child, yet not so like a child as like an old man.“David,” she said, recognising her predecessor. “Are you a spirit, too ”“I am the Ghost of Brexit Past,” David Cameron intoned. “Yours, thankfully, not mine.”She took him by the hand and the pair flew into the past, alighting first at a  meeting with Goldman Sachs bankers, where she warned Brexit would deter investment in the UK, then to a speech where she warned of the risks to EU-wide security cooperation.: Jeremy Corbyn to table no confidence motion in PMBrexit vote date not setOn to her first Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, where she said “Citizens of the World” were really “Citizens of Nowhere”, and then back to Downing Street. “Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek ” For this was where May called an election accusing the EU of undermining Brexit, then lost her majority.May awoke for a second time, and found her bedroom filled from top to bottom with angry men in suits, discussing in the most extravagant and overflowing terms exactly how they were going to dispose of her. “Come in!” exclaimed the weird and not-at-all-jolly giant presiding over the European Research Group. “I am the Ghost of Brexit Present, and we’re going to feed you into a wood chipper.”Issuing bloody threats all the while, the spirit showed May ordinary families ruining their Christmas dinners with arguments about Europe, plotting MPs, fruit crops rotting in polytunnels, and more angry figures in yellow vests shouting about betrayal.“All this is possible thanks to you isn’t it great ” the Ghost said. “Can’t wait to boil you in a pot.”And suddenly, he was gone. Lting up her eyes, May beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming towards her like a mist along the ground that has somehow managed not to be sacked. “Jeremy ” she asked. “But you’re a Remainer!” Jeremy Hunt answered not, but gave a hooded, sepulchral shrug.“Ghost of Brexit that is Yet to Come!” May exclaimed. “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.” And truly, the sights of no-deal Brexit Britain chilled May to the bone.She was transported back to her Commons office, but behind her desk Prime Minister Tom Tugendhat had his head in his hands. His government of national unity, formed in the wake of splits in the two main parties, was collapsing. Amid a stack of resignation letters were demands from Nicola Sturgeon for a Section  order, and calls from Sinn Fein for a border poll in Northern Ireland.In the streets, protesters gathered round skips filled with burning copies of David Cameron’s memoirs for warmth. There were no negotiations with the EU Brussels was in chaos since the far right surged in European elections. Nor was President Pence in a position to offer a trade deal, what with the legal trouble.The spectre took May to conflicts in Ukraine and Yemen, where the UK had given up any pretence of exerting its influence. And they visited China, which continued to suck up production and jobs as the West dismantled the world trade system it had designed. Actually, they went to Japan first before Hunt worked out his mistake.“Good spirit,” May cried when she had seen these things “Assure me that I may yet change these shadows. I will live in the past, present and future. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach!”She awoke with a start again, and knew things were dferent. Flinging open the window of Number , she made a series of unnatural jerking movements, like a jostled shop mannequin about to topple over.“But darling,” cried her husband Philip, “you’re dancing with joy! And only last night you were so despondent.”Beaming, she turned to him. “I know what I have to do.”: Brexit: There’s only one way out of this screw-up – Christine Jardine©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845913.1545206611!/image/image.jpg","title":"how home office is blocking glasgow s efforts to provide true asylum martyn mclaughlin","story":"The Home Office#s intransigent approach to providing housing for asylum seekers is causing anger and mistrust across the country, writes Martyn McLaughlin.Anyone who has paid attention to the Home Office’s thoughtless and negligent approach to housing asylum seekers over the past decade will not be unduly surprised by the latest damning report from the Home Affairs Select Committee.The most obvious question to draw from its primary conclusion – that local authorities across the UK are experiencing a crisis of trust in a broken system – is quite simple. What took so long Britain’s dispersal policy has been unfit for purpose for years. The Home Office’s existing ‘Compass’ contract places the responsibility for housing some of society’s most vulnerable iniduals with multinational conglomerates, some of whom had no prior experience in the complex asylum housing sector. In Glasgow, where Serco has been widely criticised, there have been numerous examples of the initiative’s folly: families forced to reside in properties ridden with vermin and damp, or which lacked essentials such as window panes and heating. Serco’s plan the change the locks on the properties of asylum seekers earlier this summer sparked widespread protests and a legal challenge. Charities and NGOs forced to pick up the pieces have been some of the fiercest critics of Compass, but the new report, published on Monday, shows that councils are fast catching up. With confidence in the entire process waning, MPs have warned that the entire system could soon become untenable.“Nearly two years after our previous report, very little has improved and mistrust by local authorities of central Government has deepened,” the committee noted. “The Government’s handling of the replacement for Compass has led dispersal authorities to consider withdrawal from participation in the dispersal scheme.”In truth, the use of the word replacement is a tad disingenuous renewal would a far more fitting descriptor, given the UK Government looks set to plough ahead with issuing decade-long Asylum Accommodation and Support Servicescontracts. The acronym may be new, but it is Compass in all but name.: Insight: Asylum seekers at breaking point as trauma takes its toll on mental healthThe dissatisfaction over the dispersal scheme is most keenly felt in Yorkshire, but it is proving contagious. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, recently wrote to Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, detailing his misgivings regarding oversight of the dispersal contract, and underlining the need for a fairer distribution of asylum arrivals across the country. Emphasising the gravity of the problems, Mr Burnham warned him that Manchester’s ten local authorities were now “seriously considering” their continued participation in the scheme. Fortunately, especially for the ,-plus asylum seekers in Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow City Council is not inclined to follow suit. It was one of the first cities in the UK after London to join the dispersal scheme and for nearly  years, it has taken great pride in its participation.The city, in turn, has benefited immeasurably. In the space of a generation, its communities and culture have been enriched and Glasgow’s reputation as a welcoming city has been enhanced. The SNP administration knows this only too well, and it is keen to continue with the dispersal programme,not the precise arrangements put in place by the Home Office. When Glasgow first became part of the initiative, it was the city council itself which was the contract holder. All these years later, and in light of the disastrous Compass contract, the council was minded to take over the reins for AASC. : Brian Wilson: Serco right about one thing in asylum seeker eviction rowAfter making a formal expression of interest, it received a -page form from the Home Office, designed for organisations with direct experience of providing asylum accommodation in the past ten years. It was, said Susan Aitken, the council leader, “almost impossible for us to answer”.Undeterred, she is among other local authority heads pressing for greater oversight of the new AASC arrangements, albeit to little avail. The Home Office has repeatedly warned that ceding control of property inspections to local authorities, for example, would compromise its ability to hold accommodation providers to account. It is a claim as laughable as it is absurd. Such is the Home Office’s commitment to ensuring that asylum housing is fit for purpose, it employs the grand total of nine contract compliance officers, responsible for assessing , dispersal accommodationproperties across the UK. A single officer is based in Glasgow.The workload they are able to carry out has produced some damning conclusions. Between March  and January this year, for example, less than a quarter of those properties inspected were found to be compliant with the requirements of the Compass contract. Close to halfwere deemed not fit for purpose. A separate inspection report carried out earlier this year by David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that the Home Office inspection regime was essentially a system of spot checks, which were neither informed by intelligence, nor subject to follow-up inspections. The Home Office has shown itself to be unable,not unwilling, to ensure some of Scotland’s most marginalised and vulnerable people are given proper shelter. If it is allowed to steamroll through its plans for AASC with no meaningful changes, we will all be the poorer for it.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845818.1545206166!/image/image.jpg","title":"why birmingham may be a role model for scottish cities chris mccall","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...After three months in Birmingham, Chris McCall says the rebirth of UK#s second largest conurbation could have lessons for Scotland#s cities.Their faces said it all. It was a look of slight surprise crossed with mild concern. I had told them I was moving to Birmingham. Whether it was friends, family or colleagues, they struggled to see the appeal of le in the UK’s second largest city.I would explain I was moving for a three-month work secondment. It was too good an opportunity to turn down. I planned to travel home to Glasgow most weekends. Exploring a new city would be fun.“The only thing I know about Birmingham is there are a lot of motorways,” was a typical response. It had that in common with my home town, I thought. Here was another place that had been determined to bulldoze its way to post-war prosperity. Unlike Scotland’s biggest city, Brum held its nerve and built not one but two ring roads – instead of the half-finished mess inflicted on Charing Cross and Tradeston.But what did I really know about this sprawling metropolis  That the car was king, of course. Millions of them were built there and thousands of properties had been cleared to make way for the roads its new car-owning society demanded. Birmingham was the UK’s Motown – but with a much heavier musical legacy Black Sabbath never wrote cutesy soul songs.“Birmingham’s name is known everywhere,” the broadcaster Jonathan Meades observed two decades ago. “But its people aren’t, and nor is their city which is in the middle of England and is Middle England. It’s hyperbolically typical of England, yet at the same time it’s hermetic – it’s an ignored voice in the heart of the country.”It’s fair to say that downtown Brum is still largely dominated by its roads. Yet it’s gradually moving away from the cult of the automobile towards a more sustainable future which could offer examples for Scotland’s major cities.When I stepped off the train at New Street in September, I was determined I would understand Birmingham by the time I left. I might not grow to love it, I thought, but I would at the very least appreciate what it had to offer.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesStations can tell us a lot about a place, and the story of New Street tells us more than most. It was once a grand Victorian affair with an Italianate style hotel and a spectacular  canopy designed by Edward Alfred Cowper. It was a terminus that reflected the commercial might of the Midlands.That fine station roof was one of many Brum landmarks to be damaged beyond repair by the Luftwaffe, while the hotel fell victim to British Rail’s west coast mainline modernisation programme of the early s – the same damned project that blighted London’s Euston station. The new New Street was generally despised from the off. Instead of providing a beacon of the future, it condemned passengers to a hideous concrete bunker. A costly refurbishment programme began in . While the s remain subterranean – meaning diesel fumes still linger – the upstairs is now a bold and bright concourse.There’s plenty of space for strangers to find their bearings. “If you think it’s bad now, you should have seen it before,” Brummies say, with characteristic self-deprecation. “Brum will be great when it’s finally finished,” is another line you hear regularly. This is a city with a long record of tearing itself down and trying something dferent.The New Street rebuild is just one of several ambitious local projects. The redeveloped Bullring shopping centre boasts a Selfridges, the high-end department store long coveted by Glasgow. The city’s modern tram network is currently being extended with little of the fuss seen in Edinburgh.: Kevin Buckle: Edinburgh’s lost railway could be restoredHere I was, privileged to be witnessing the rebirth of one of the UK’s major cities in real time. Unlike in Dundee, which has chosen to take the Bilbao route of hanging its international appeal on an eye-catching museum, Birmingham has opted to get the basics right. If you can offer numerous decent shops and a gleaming station, visitors will soon follow.For a city with a long association with the car, it’s investing substantial amounts in public transport. Its suburban rail network has been continuously growing for years. Then there’s the small matter of HS, the eye-wateringly expensive infrastructure project – or colossal folly, depending on your viewpoint – which will link Birmingham with London via a new high-speed rail line.In comparison, it strikes me that Scotland’s two biggest cities seem incapable of sorting out public transport in their own backyards. Edinburgh’s buses are the best outside of London but the capital seems uninterested in reopening its extensive network of suburban railways to passengers. The less said about the tram system, the better.Glasgow, meanwhile, boasts dozens of stations yet is stuck with a bus network that’s grimly tolerated at best. Its own plans for a tram system bit the dust  years ago and have never seriously been reconsidered.Brummies would be the first to tell you their city isn’t perfect. Among other things, it lacks any instantly recognisble landmarks to entice visitors. The council hopes its flash public library, opened in , is becoming one. The -storey building positively screams modern civic ambition.I looked beyond these modern developments whenever I felt the dull ache of home sickness. I was fortunate to stay a short distance from the Birmingham and Worcester canal, one of two major waterways built in the Georgian era. If you enjoy a stroll along a quiet towpath, Birmingham is your place. It’s one of the few parts of the city you’re guaranteed not see any cars.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4846716.1545298904!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit second referendum plausible says amber rudd","story":"There is a #plausible argument# for the public to be asked to vote again on BrexitMPs remain deadlocked, a leading Cabinet minister has said.Amber Rudd – one of Theresa May’s strongest allies – acknowledged her comments would “distress” some of her Tory colleagues and stressed she was fully committed to the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.The work and pensions secretary insisted she did not want a referendum and called for MPs across the Commons to reach a consensus as a way of preventing a no-deal BrexitMrs May’s withdrawal agreement is thrown out in January’s parliamentary showdown.: The Big BBC Brexit Panto Special is here – Bill JamiesonBut her intervention was welcomed as a “massive moment” by campaigners calling for a so-called People’s Vote, with Tory former minister Anna Soubry praising Ms Rudd as “brave and principled”.Ms Rudd backed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to supportthe Prime Minister’s deal is rejected.The work and pensions secretary told ITV’s Peston: “I don’t want a people’s vote or a referendum in general, butParliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus I could see there would be a plausible argument for it.”She added: “Parliament has to reach a majority on how it’s going to leave the European Union.“If it fails to do so, then I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues.”Ms Rudd said an indicative vote would “flush out” MPs by forcing them to show their support for one option or another and encourage those whose favoured ideas are rejected to reach a compromise.“We are going to have to find a way, as MPs, of working together to find a consensus, of agreeing on how to stop no-deal taking place,” she said.Her comments were seized on by pro-EU campaigners.Labour’s Owen Smith, a backer of anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “Amber Rudd may be the first Tory Cabinet member to say she’d rather have a people’s vote than allow a catastrophic no-deal to unfold, but she won’t be the last.“This is a massive moment for our campaign.”Meanwhile Ireland followed the UK and the European Union in setting out the latest stages of its no-deal Brexit planning.“In many signicant ways, a no-deal Brexit would pose unique, unprecedented and extremely dficult challenges for the EU, including Ireland, and especially the UK,” the Irish Government document said.As part of the plan, Dublin Port is creating extra parking for hundreds of trucks from the UK awaiting inspection after Brexit.In London, Mrs May will meet her Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki for talks.The discussions are expected to focus on defence and security co-operation, but come as the Prime Minister is desperately trying to secure further reassurances from EU leaders about the Northern Ireland backstop measures inthe Brexit deal before the crunch Commons vote in the week starting  January.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who met the Prime Minister on Wednesday, said Mrs May’s goals were “a wee bit nebulous”.“There’s not a lot of detail there,” Ms Sturgeon said.“She says she’s working with the EU, trying to find assurances.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##..

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits. And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms.

Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8737398.1544617405!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley luxury maldives holiday paid for by mystery friend","story":"The trip, which the DUP MP said he partially paid for, was part-funded by a mystery friend who Mr Paisley declined to identy.Ian Paisley, M.P.The holiday for the entire Paisley family was not registered in the House of Commons register of membersrsquo interests.The revelations in a BBC Spotlight programme broadcast on Tuesday night come just a fortnight after the North Antrim MP ed from the longest ever suspension from the House of Commons.That suspension of  sitting days came after it was revealed that he took luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then advocated on behalf of a regime which was facing allegations of war crimes.Mr Paisley told Spotlight that he did not need to declare the foreign holiday and that the trip had not been paid for by the Malian government.The MP, his we and his two sons stayed full-board for five days in October and November  at a luxury resort on one of the coral islands in the Indian Ocean famed for sandy beaches and blue lagoons.Gavin Millar QC, a legal expert on parliamentary rules, told Spotlight that the Nolan principles on standards in public le placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he has not registered the trip.ldquoFor the record, the government of the Males did not organise or pay for my family vacation in , which I do not intend to go into with you.

He had made arrangements with Antrim Borough Council to have their carriage kitted out with flowers and champagne, only for his plans to be put on ice due to the weather.Not one to hang around, he put together a back-up plan to ask Leanne for her hand in marriage at the Templeton Hotel in Templepatrick.Leanne, , said: “We’re five years together, we’ve one child at four and another on the way. Romance is sort of put to the side. I hadn’t a clue this was coming. Leannes four-year-old daughter Quinn was there to witness the romantic moment on Sunday“We had our gym party on Saturday night. The idea was to go up the big wheel first then go to the party and be able to tell everyone, celebrate with them and show them the ring.“Because of the weather warning, rather than wait, he went for plan B.”At the Templeton they were taken to a reserved table decorated with crystals where staff brought out drinks and a plate with ‘Marry Me ’ written on it in chocolate.Leanne said: “Then he got down on one knee and gave me the ring. It was really romantic. I was crying my eyes out. Then he told me what I could have won.”She added: “At least we got a second go at it. The big wheel will probably be the story we’ll tell peopleanyone asks how we got engaged.“Our daughter Quinn, four, was with us the second time.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christmas in comfort at clonard","story":"CLONARD parishioners will be able to enjoy their Christmas Mass even more this year as the traditional hard wooden pews have been consigned to the past. In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chris moncrieff whether youre a leaver or a remainer a second poll would be a betrayal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is true whether you are a Remainer or a Leaver. Parliament ordained the referendum and, at the same time, gave a solemn promise that they’d abide by the result..pushThe fact politicians have got themselves in such a mess trying to implement the referendum result in favour of quitting the EU cannot ever be used as an excuse for defaulting on the original undertaking.To her eternal credit, the Prime Minister refuses to bow to the clamour for a second referendum.She hit out at Tony Blair, accusing him of “insulting” the British people and the office of Prime Minister by “undermining” Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.In a pointed swipe at the Labour heavyweight, the Prime Minister said a second referendum would amount to parliament abdicating responsibility.Mrs May said: “For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision.“Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for. I remain determined to see that happen. I will not let the British people down.”The trouble is that the people who really matter — the great British electorate — are being fobbed off with contradictory stories about what is going on behind the scenes. Some are insisting that the Cabinet is involved in its own civil war about whether to have a second referendum, while others insist this is completely untrue.Meanwhile, those calling for another poll are claiming that those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did not appreciate what this would involve.How patronising. Of course, most people realised that the EU negotiating team would try to squeeze every drop of blood out of the UK in what has approached the level of bullying the Prime Minister partly, no doubt, to frighten any other member states which might be considering following in the UK’s footsteps.It’s asthe elitists simply assume — arrogantly — that they know better than the people they are supposed to serve .Some of the reasons given by those demanding another referendum are bizarre — to put it mildly. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said the Remain campaign during the original referendum fell far short of even being effective.Well, that is laughable and is no reason for going to the polls again.The simple truth is that the British voters, on both sides of the argument, deserve better of their politicians than this.n Theresa May is fighting her corner against a stubborn and obdurate team of negotiators in Brussels, who are finding her a much tougher opponent than they’d probably expected.But there are those who would like to see a little more drama and aggression on the part of the UK team.In similar circumstances, Margaret Thatcherwould thump the table and brandish her famous handbag, frightening the lives out of the Brussels team.Theresa May cannot match that — but she is adamant not to surrender and is to be commended for that.But what is urgently required is some kind of magic to sort out the shambles in the House of Commons, where at the moment getting a majority on anything appears to be a major problem.Somehow, all this has to be resolved and the Leavers get what they voted for in the referendum in a fair and honourable way. n When all this is over, major surgery will be required to restore the shattered Conservative Party back to rude health. It may well take a new leader to do that.As you might expect, the usual suspects, like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , have both indicated they will be in the running.But in politics, it is often not the obvious names who get the crown.Has anyone thought of David Lidington — the quiet man who is Theresa May’s de facto number two  He is the dark horse to watch.But there is going to be a lot more discord before that position is reached."},{"url":null,"title":"ards town hall to be lit up to mark lgbt event after tight council vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"leadsom insists managed nodeal brexit is possible amid cabinet divisions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Similar facilities on a smaller scale will be needed in Rosslare.In Dublin Airport there is need for new inspection rooms and a border control post for animals also.Work is underway to identy temporary sites for these facilities in the event of a no deal scenario.Emergency legislationSome  pieces of emergency legislation will need to be enacted ahead of March  to prepare for a no deal scenario. Some of this will be primary legislation, which will see all other work in the Dáil grind to a halt. Primary legislation will be needed in areas including healthcare, health insurance, the single electricity market, broadcasting and housing provision.Medicines and food supplyFurther work is being done on the possible need for emergency measures that may be needed in relation to medicines and food supply. Legislation and ongoing consultation is being done in the area of medicine supply and cross border medical services.The planning document notes that it is  Ireland’s priority that “Irish patients should not be at a disadvantage or deprived of medicines as a result of Brexit”.The Tanáiste said Ireland is not facing food shortages in the event of a no deal and said work is underway to ensure the continued supply of medicines. At the moment stockpiling of medicines is already done to ensure supply he noted.Trade routesThe landbridge is expected to be hit with “severe delays” in the aftermath of a no deal, with Dover-Calais being noted as a potential bottleneck.This will affect goods moving between Ireland the rest of the single market. The Department of Transport is working with companies to identy alternative options.The border questionIn relation to avoiding border infrastructure between Ireland and Northern Ireland the document says the government’s focus is on prevent the emergence of a border. It does not outline plans on how a border will be avoided in the event of a no deal.Pressed on the absence of a contingency plan to avoid infrastructure the Tanaiste said there are a number of areas that dont have a contingency plan.There are no \"easy answers\" to avoiding infrastructure he said. However, he underlined the governments commitment to ensuring no border re-emerges on the island of Ireland.Additional customs staffThe Government has already said it is accelerating the recruitment of revenue and other officials who will be needed in the event of post-Brexit.JusticeMeasures are being prepared to ensure that there is a viable extradition process with the UK and that the exchange of information in relation to law enforcement is continued.Mr Coveney said the plan was an “evolving document” but the real hope was that the House of Commons will come to realise that Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal is the best way forward.He said that people who are playing down the impact of a no deal Brexit or describing it as “another millennium bug really don’t know what they are talking about”.Referring to the plan, he said it should make everybody realise “why we don’t want a no deal Brexit”.“This is why we spent two years putting together a detailed plan that allows for a managed Brexit,” Mr Coveney said.“We need to get back to that deal politically.”He said Ireland will face “multiple challenges” as a country and an economy.“There is no such thing as a contingency plan that will maintain the status quo as we have today. This is a damage limitation exercise.”In a no deal scenario, the UK will become a ‘third country’, meaning it will no longer be represented on the EU’s institutions or subject to the Unions rules or laws.Ireland’s contingency plan states: “A do deal Brexit would require an immediate focus on crisis management and  possible temporary solutions , which would be rapidly implemented until the necessary longer-term adjustments are in place.“For Ireland, a no deal Brexit would potentially involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral impacts. Grappling with the enormous range of impacts both in the immediate short term and in the longer term will involve dficult and signicant choice of a practical, strategic and political nature.”Cabinet will convene on January  to discuss further contingency planning.The chief whip is examining the legislative to determine what needs to be done to ensure legislation can be passed in time."},{"url":null,"title":"motorway chargepoint ban urged for hybrid cars","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latest battery-only cars need just five minutes at the quickest chargepoints to add  miles to their range, compared with an hour for almost all plug-in hybrids to achieve the same benefit. Battery-only cars have no combustion engine, while plug-in hybrids can operate in full electric mode, using conventional fuel or a combination of both.

Now they have wireless technology..pushTo keep track of their animals in Lapland, Northern Finland’s vast and remote snow-covered forests, reindeer herders are turning to technology by fitting them with internet-connected collars.Herders who previously spent weeks searching for their reindeer in sub-zero wilderness can now instantly see where they are on a mobile app that receives up-to-date location data.“In all sectors of society, thisefficiency is playing a big role. It’s the same in reindeer husbandry,” said Seppo Koivisto, whose hundreds of reindeer roam Lapland’s , square-kilometrePalojarvi District.Lapland’s reindeer are the main source of livelihood for about , herders, so there is high interest in technology that can help manage them. Mr Koivisto is using the latest generation of wireless collars made possible by a group that includes Finland’s Reindeer Herding Association and Helsinki-based communications firm Digita.“We have fewer workers, so their actions should be more and more efficient all the time and this technology lets them do that,” said Mr Koivisto. Since he started using the technology, he has only had to hire half the usual number of workers.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Matti Sarkela from Finland’s Reindeer Herding Association holds an internet-connected reindeer collar The technology can also help herders account for attacks from predators such as wolverines and lynx that roam across the Russian border.At least , reindeer are killed every year, according to the herding association. Most that die in Lapland’s forests are never found. Mr Koivisto says he loses about eight percent of his herd annually.The collars, which use GPS satellite positioning and special long-distance wireless networks, help herders find reindeer corpses so they can claim valuable compensation from the Finnish government.If a collar-fitted reindeer doesn’t move after about four hours, its icon changes from green to red on the app, signaling a potential attack.To best locate groups of reindeer – which are bred for their meat, milk and fur – the trackers are fitted on the herd’s female leader.“In the old days, we roughly knew reindeer locations, in which part of the district they were,” said herder Jarno Konttaniemi. “But today, with this technology, we know exactly where they are.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  At least , reindeer are killed every year Digita built the long-range network, which it says is the world’s most northerly Internet of Things network. The Internet of Things refers to the next generation of devices and everyday objects that are connected to the internet.While reindeer herding has roots going back hundreds of years, “at least some of the reindeer owners are really up-to-date when it comes to using technology”, said Ari Kuukka, Digita’s head of Internet of Things services.The herding association has been working for years on a reliable GPS reindeer tracking system. The main challenge was coming up with a device that was cheap but had a long-lasting battery.The third and latest prototype is the size of a deck of cards, stays charged for about a year, and costs about  euros .The herding association hopes to eventually shrink the transmitter down to a coin-sized microchip that can be attached to a reindeer’s ear, said Matti Sarkela, the herding association’s head of office who has previously helped develop a mobile app that alerts drivers to reindeer near Finland’s often icy roads.He hopes embracing new technologies can inspire the younger generation to carry on the herding tradition.“It has brought a lot of young people into our industry all the time,” said Mr Sarkela. “It’s a really positive thing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"delays expected collision derry buncrana road","story":"Motorists are advised to expect delays on the main Derry to Buncrana road to a road traffic collision.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe accident, involving a Volkswagen jeep and Volkswagen Passat has occurred close to the Elaghbeg Industrial Estate."},{"url":null,"title":"motorists urged vigilant pranksters target vehicles derrys bogside","story":"A Derry councillor has appealed to so called pranksters to stop targeting vehicles in the Bogside area.Sinn Féin Councillor Sharon Duddys plea comes after several cars in the vicinity of the Little Diamond  area had their tyres let down and super glue poured over the nozzle on the wheels.Councillor Duddy “I am aware that a number of residents not only has the misfortune of the tyres in their cars being let down but also whoever was behind it  put super glue in the nozzle on the wheels.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Those  behind this nonsense may think they are being funny, but for the car owners it certainly isn’t.“We all know the hassle involved in having the misfortune of getting a flat tyre on your car  but to find it was deliberate and that someone has gone to all this effort must be very frustrating.“I would like to make an appeal to whoever was involved to stop and think about they are doing and financial expense the car owners are going through.\""},{"url":null,"title":"psni gardai launch christmas drink drive campaign derry donegal border","story":"The PSNI and Gardai today launched their annual Christmas drink-drive campaign on the Derry-Inishowen border.The message this Christmas is Never, Ever Drink or Drug Drive.  The message in the campaign is that drink driving destroys lives, families and communities.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place. But the EDAC squad are delighted with their achievement anyway. The other two participation point scorers were Janine Murray and Ella Carroll.Tough in LanzaroteRising star Gordy Graham headed for the sun in Lanzarote to make his latest marathon effort and with typical cussedness, the weather promptly stuck two fingers up at him by providing a strong headwind on the out and back course, the sting in the tail being that it was in the homeward half.

Jodi Foster and her sister Kari from Spa Primary School and Erin Moore from St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Saul, finished as the top  qualiers outside the qualying teams.Alex Robinson was not so fortunate for the boys and after a slow start, he could not find his way far enough through the traffic in a field of over  runners to take a qualying position.This weekend will see the EDAC Juniors on the road again as they travel to participate in the All-Ireland Uneven Age Group Cross-Country Championships at Navan Racecourse.The seniors have an equally dficult and y journey to participate in the North West Cross-Country in Gransha Park, Derry, but at least they only have to run k when they get there.To paraphrase an old First World War marching song: ldquoItrsquos a long trip to run in Derry.And itrsquos unique too in that everyone runs together, men, women, older men and women and junior men and women.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

Barry wants to create something that feels a bit safer and is more bespoke, somewhere a person with a learning disability and their friends and family can all get together and have a good time.She said that she was able to tap into Barryrsquos natural love of disco and music by chance over a year ago.ldquoBarry has always loved discos and hersquos always held discos for us as a family.

It will be somewhere where we all can have a beer and a boogie and we hope it can run every month.Barry will be spinning the decks himself at the disco, while some of his friends and instructors from the Black Box will also attend so that he can hit the dance floor with his family and friends.A lover of dance floor classics from Abba, Katie Perry, Lady Gaga and Boyzone, he promises to create a festive atmosphere by playing lots of Christmas hits.ldquoI want to have a good social le. I just want to get out of the house more, said Barry. ldquoI started doing disco years and years ago. I just love music and this is going to be so great.Susan paid tribute to Alison Lyttle, Autisim Initiativersquos community engagement manager, who has been instrumental in helping to support the event, as well as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council who contributed to start-up costs.The Black Moon disco will be held at Diamond Pats in Central Promenade, Newcastle, tonight from -pm.

I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games.

The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the same in reindeer husbandry, said Seppo Koivisto, whose hundreds of reindeer roam Laplandrsquos , square-kilometrePalojarvi District.Laplandrsquos reindeer are the main source of livelihood for about , herders, so there is high interest in technology that can help manage them.Mr Koivisto is using the latest generation of wireless collars made possible by a group that includes Finlandrsquos Reindeer Herding Association and Helsinki-based communications firm Digita.ldquoWe have fewer workers, so their actions should be more and more efficient all the time and this technology lets them do that, said Mr Koivisto.Since he started using the technology, he has only had to hire half the usual number of workers.Matti Sarkela from Finlandrsquos Reindeer Herding Association holds an internet-connected reindeer collar The technology can also help herders account for attacks from predators such as wolverines and lynx that roam across the Russian border.At least , reindeer are killed every year, according to the herding association.

It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
