Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

By 1pm, two hours after it reopened, a line of about 40 vehicles meant an hour-long roadside wait for burger fans.The branch is among 33 outlets the fast food chain has reopened for drive-through only in London and south-east England as it eases back into business following the loosening of lockdown restrictions.McDonald’s and other fast food chains including Burger King, KFC and Nando’s are trialling a gradual reopening of restaurants to allow staff to get used to new safety measures and practise physical distancing inside.In Bushey, sisters Casey and Alycia Levy, aged 18 and 20, had bought burgers, chicken nuggets and cold drinks as a surprise for their grandparents, who have been isolating for 11 weeks. “They’ve been at home since 1 March, so we wanted to cheer them up,” Alycia said.Matthew Cohen had brought his children Dylan, 7, and Summer, 11, for lunch. “We’ve been missing the sweet and sour sauce with our chicken nuggets,” Cohen said. The family usually visit the drive-through weekly, and had a longer wait than usual, because only one lane was open, but did not find a radical change in the experience.The changes in restaurant operations will be more noticeable for the staff. They now have their temperatures checked when they arrive for a shift, and will be given protective equipment including masks and gloves. They are also protected from customers by perspex screens installed at the drive-through windows, and from their fellow workers inside the restaurant’s kitchen.As a McDonald’s employee – his face covered with a face mask and wearing a hi-vis vest – marshalled the queue of cars, other staff members walked the line of vehicles to tell customers they were serving only a limited menu. Clients were asked to use contactless payment methods if possible and spending was capped at £25 per vehicle.The details of which branches were reopening were kept secret until just 45 minutes before the first customers were served, as McDonald’s tried to avoid a rerun of its experience in France and Switzerland. When drive-throughs were reopened there, the first locations were announced well in advance, leading to queues of up to seven hours.Many customers at Bushey had heard about the reopening on social media and had brought their children for a trip out to buy a meal.By lunchtime, so many vehicles were queueing for the Bushey branch that they were starting to disrupt traffic on the adjoining A41, and the restaurant’s franchise owner and some of his staff enlisted the help of a nearby highway maintenance crew to cordon off part of the road, creating a one-way system.Despite almost two months passing since the government introduced lockdown measures and the closure of seating spaces in all restaurants, some customers were still unsure how to behave. Having ordered burgers from their car window, one mother and son were disappointed not to be able to eat their lunch at a sunny table outside.The fast food chain said it had informed police forces, local authorities and the highways agency in all places where it was due to reopen. At one restaurant, in Peterborough, a police officer called in to check that the agreed vehicle queueing system was in place and that no further crowd control measures were required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cafb59c1f374cb86510df27afaedda7aeb2b595/7_195_2073_1243/master/2073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1731ed340421f0db2ed266751615dbda","title":"boohoo founders team up with biotech firm for covid 19 home test kit uk july","story":"Saliva test in development and needs regulatory approval but could be available in UK in JulyA 10-minute home saliva test for coronavirus is under development in a deal struck between the billionaire co-founder of online fashion brand BooHoo and a Cambridge-based firm.The antigen test, which would be available to buy, will look similar to a pregnancy test but will use a saliva sample rather than urine, and is designed to give a result within 10 minutes.Current NHS home test kits rely on swabbing the tonsils and nostrils, which can be uncomfortable. A recent study published by the not-for-profit research group medRxiv, which is backed by Yale University, found that saliva was more sensitive for detection of the virus in Covid-19 patients than nasal swabs.The test kit is still in development and needs to be approved by regulators, but the company expects it to be available in the UK in July. Regulatory approval will also be sought in the rest of Europe as well as in the US.On Wednesday, Cambridge-based Avacta signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medusa19 , a venture set up by Mahmud Kamani, a co-founder of Boohoo, and Richard Hughes, a former non-executive director of the online fashion brand, who are also shareholders in Avacta, to sell the tests to consumers online. Medusa19 will also have non-exclusive rights to supply the tests to businesses for workforce screening.Alistair Smith, Avacta’s chief executive, said the price of the test would probably be similar to a commercial HIV test, which cost about $30 (£25), but would be lower if health organisations or businesses bought it in bulk. The company said it had had inquiries from firms that wanted to test staff to ensure they are healthy before they return to work.Avacta is looking for more partners to make the test strip. Smith said millions of tests would be needed each month across the world as countries emerge from lockdown. “The potential size of this market, and the expected demand from businesses for workforce screening, is substantial,” he added.The Avacta test is believed to be the world’s first rapid saliva-based home test kit. In the US, a saliva-based test developed by Rutgers University’s RUCDR Infinite Biologics firm received emergency approval from the US regulator at the end of April, but the samples have to be sent off to a lab for processing.Further work by Avacta found that the Affimer reagents it uses block the interaction between the coronavirus’s spike protein and a receptor on human cells to which the virus binds, and may have the potential to prevent infection. The company is looking for a partner to develop an Affimer therapy.Kamani and Hughes said: “Given this test will be saliva-based, it could be used in airports, offices, factories and in the home environment, providing a result within minutes and with no requirement for medical supervision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2837915e71bb75cd01eebc2b30ac9e1dd39b3590/0_99_3000_1802/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1413b523a983e1116ca8579a1d29d4c7","title":"easyjet to resume domestic flights across england and france","story":"Passengers and crew must wear masks but middle seats will not be blockedEasyJet is to resume a small number of flights on 15 June, with increased safety measures on board including mandatory wearing of face masks, as it returns to the skies after grounding its entire fleet on 30 March.The airline initially will restart domestic routes in the UK and France where it says there is sufficient customer demand to support profitable flying. Further routes will be added in the following weeks, as and when passenger demand rises and lockdown measures ease further across Europe.The company will introduce enhanced cleaning and disinfection of its aircraft, make disinfectant wipes and hand sanitiser available on board, and require all passengers and cabin crew, as well as ground crew, to wear masks. There will be no food service onboard, initially.However, the airline will not block off the middle seats in its planes despite saying last month it was considering such a move. It says the measures “have been implemented in consultation with aviation authorities”. Before the announcement, easyJet launched an emergency cost-cutting programme, with a hiring, promotion and pay freeze, and furloughing all but 650 of its 14,000 staff.EasyJet’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the airline was taking “small and carefully planned steps” to gradually resume operations. “We will continue to closely monitor the situation across Europe so, when more restrictions are lifted, the schedule will continue to build over time to match demand, while also ensuring we are operating efficiently and on routes that our customers want,” he said.EasyJet’s announcement comes just days after the airline revealed that the personal data of 9 million customers, including email addresses and travel details, was accessed in a cyber-attack. Of those people affected, 2,208 had their credit card information stolen, although no passport details were uncovered.The company has contacted customers whose card details were taken, while everyone else affected will be contacted by 26 May.

However, this isn’t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it’s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are safe enough to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff and parents alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of “test, trace and isolate” strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.That scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. A recent study in the Lancet found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don’t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can’t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.Given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium, that aren’t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils – because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities – or to focus on older pupils – because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead – is a political one.Flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.Given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented – and then only if “test, trace, isolate”, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.The tragedy is that the countries that moved the fastest and “crunched the curve” are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what’s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the UK government’s poor decisions over the past 12 weeks.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

Alliances are now crucial to reject the superpower’s bullyingAmid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred. But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19. A lot of the speculation about the post-coronavirus political world is plain fanciful. But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic’s role in boosting the global heft of China.The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But when the Obama administration’s US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, was asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee to assess Covid-19’s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China’s rise.Covid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the “belt and road” strategies, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China’s “wolf-warrior” diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump’s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network.As the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump’s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China’s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate.At this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power’s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government’s “integrated review” of Britain’s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain’s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too.Covid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since Tony Blair could write that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own.But it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic “long game” with China that would give Britain greater political leverage “to bring China into the rules-based international system – through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.” Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain’s leverage in that or any other global order?Johnson’s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach – an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war – that the American diplomat George Kennan crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century. Yet it would have to do it in the full knowledge that the UK is nowhere near as powerful as the US was in the postwar world, that the US has defected to isolationism, and that Brexit Britain is itself seen – and partly sees itself – as an alliance breaker.China in 2020 is not the USSR in 1946. But there is little sign that the Tory party is anywhere close to agreeing on the mature, long-term strategy on China that is needed. The cold war and Euroscepticism both cast long shadows. The bulk of newer Tory MPs, many of them active in the new China Research Group of MPs chaired by the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat, now think about China as a threat but regard European allies as the past and thus lack any workable strategy for constraining Chinese power.Yet Covid-19 has made the question of how to stand up to China more pressing than before. The dilemmas are not restricted to the Tory party or to Britain. Labour has notably toughened its line, as its China spokesman Stephen Kinnock made clear this week. But no single nation state, even the US, can stand up to China and its authoritarian model without alliances, without patient deployment of hard and soft power, and without a readiness to make tactical compromises.The answer for a medium-sized power like Britain is to have an alliance-based and institutions-based containment strategy and to work with Germany, France, the EU, India, Australia and others to achieve a relationship with China that rejects both Chinese and American bullying. The problem is that this is the one thing that this government, besotted with its self-image of Britain as an independent, buccaneering world player, cannot bring itself to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a28733c248f0a7008ee04539dc2a439abb8d44/0_0_2858_1715/master/2858.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4001c65bd751c3e6b7dcc9bd2e5d9ec7","title":"summer holiday no 10 coronavirus","story":"With coronavirus kiboshing holidays abroad, the government is praying the public will be happy with Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beachWhen coronavirus first arrived in Britain, ministers initially placed their hopes on the summer months offering relief from the pandemic. The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.That wasn’t to be. Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has limited effect on Covid-19’s spread. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.With the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pitting himself against the bulk of his party over a gradual rather than a rapid easing of lockdown, the UK is now on course to move at a more stately pace than its European counterparts when it comes to socialising, the reopening of bars – and holidays. While the EU has a three-stage plan to restart tourism, and Italy and Spain aim to reopen for visitors as early as June, the UK is taking a rather different approach.Next month, a two-week quarantine is being introduced for all new arrivals to the UK, including British people returning from abroad. The move has been heavily criticised by the travel industry, with one trade body warning it will have a “devastating” impact on the UK aviation industry and the wider economy.However, with Johnson determined to press on with what one No 10 adviser describes as the “slow and steady” path out of lockdown, the focus in government is not on appeasing airline companies but working out how to keep a potentially restless British public onside while its neighbours holiday.Even if talks of “air bridges” – allowing quarantine-free travel to and from low-infection countries such as Greece – come to fruition, the general sense in government is that the bulk of Britons will not be jetting abroad this summer.As well as quarantine and safety concerns, the economic reality means extravagant holidays just won’t be an option for many. With unemployment set to increase even further and many on reduced household incomes, holidays are likely to be a luxury that people cannot afford. Social distancing practices mean that budget flights, too, could soon become much harder to find.As a result, ministers have begun to work out what they can do to keep morale up over the long summer months. While public support is now very much for lockdown continuing, the worry is what happens when other countries enjoy breaks with more ease. “If the R number rises in these countries as a result, we’ll be praised for our response – if it doesn’t, we might start to get some heat,” explains one government figure.The great hope is that the weather gods will shine on the UK. The evidence suggests that activity outside carries a much lower risk of transmission than inside. Just look at how Northern Ireland is now allowing a half dozen people from different households to gather, if they are outside. All the plans to relax socialising coming down the tracks are based on being outside. “If it rains, we’re fucked,” says one rather blunt Tory MP.“Britain’s going to look like the 1940s this summer,” predicts a government insider privy to discussions. Expect Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beach, camping breaks and, if we’re lucky, drive-in cinemas.Talks are under way across departments to see what can be done to help retail businesses move outside. There is a focus on encouraging local councils to make it easy to cut red tape for businesses so they can adapt to a new normal in which trading outside is the preferred option. Inside No 10, one good-case scenario for mid-summer is that people will be permitted to dine outside at a restaurant with someone they don’t live with.While restaurants and cafes are viewed as potential beneficiaries of good weather, the prospects for a lazy summer afternoon in the pub are bleaker. The concern is that the low cost of a pint means that it won’t be financially viable for a pub to open its garden while taking in just a small number of people – whereas a more expensive restaurant could manage. But entrepreneurial landlords will be encouraged to think outside the box.The first holiday likely to be allowed will be camping – if that works out, then private home hire could be next. Hotels are viewed as harder to reopen due to the number of people coming and going. Discussions are under way over an extended holiday season – not just the typical high season of peak summer months – given that changing circumstances mean the traditional holiday period cannot be relied upon.Ministers are considering promoting parts of the UK that are usually off the tourist trail. With an increase expected in the number of domestic tourists, it’s not only viewed as an opportunity to promote undiscovered spots – it could also be what’s needed to keep MPs on side. On Tory WhatsApp, Devon and Cornwall MPs are already worried about an influx of people to their constituencies – with locals concerned about the virus spreading. However, in No 10 there’s a sense that “common sense” will allow everyone an opportunity to explore.However, for all the efforts to keep the UK entertained this summer, the biggest risk factor may be not the weather but the economy. The furlough scheme is up for review in August and companies will be asked to pay a higher contribution. There is concern among MPs that this could be a crunch point for high unemployment. If that comes to pass, no amount of ice-cream by the coast or sitting around campfires will be enough to distract from the bad times ahead.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adc2c678c676467dc5b9c65a33149dc2e55bdccc/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=5870f7ded6ab74d31973961da2b29e1f","title":"where did henry wellcome keep his cats the great british art quiz","story":"The Wellcome Collection in London set today’s quiz with Art UK, enabling you to explore the collections of UK museums closed due to coronavirus – while answering some brain-teasersThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

Hopefully by later years it’ll be something I can do again, but developing those patient skills early on is really important.”Malik has already undertaken a gap year, so is hesitant to take another year out before starting her degree.“Because medicine is such a long degree, the idea of taking another gap year is not something I’ve really considered,” she said. “All my friends have already begun uni, and in a way, I don’t want to be left behind.”The shift to online teaching has led many to question whether the high tuition fees are worth the education they will receive, with some opting to defer until the following academic year.Dominik Wojciechowski, 21, is due to start a degree in music in September, but is trying to defer. “It’s just a waste of money,” he said. “If you don’t have orchestral classes you don’t get the experience of playing in an orchestra, which would prepare you for your career, and you won’t be able to learn the repertoire and literature of music as well.”Alongside physical distancing, the potential lack of access to facilities and equipment was also a major concern for Wojciechowski.Many students have lost part-time jobs that supported them during university, leaving them struggling to fund their education.Throughout her degree, Amy Tetsola, a 20-year-old marketing student at the University of Leicester, has had a zero-hours contract working various jobs in the hospitality sector. Since the coronavirus pandemic, this work has stopped. Tetsola is concerned about the financial implications of undertaking study without a part-time job, and has decided to defer her final year of study.Like Wojciechowski, she is struggling to reconcile the high tuition fee costs with the education she will receive.“Given my third year is the most important year of my academic career, I don’t want to compromise it by having everything delivered virtually. I’ll pay nearly £10,000 for that year, and I may have to pay full fees for online teaching. It’s not worth taking that chance,” she added. “We’re paying a lot of money to jump on a Zoom call.”Some courses will not allow deferrals because of coronavirus, and for many students, the risk of losing the place is too great to take.“It’s been a dream of mine for a long time to go to Cambridge, and part of me is terrified that if I was to reject the place and try again next year, it would be much more competitive because so many people will have deferred,” said Emily, who is due to start her master’s degree in September.Emily said the loss of her dream university experience is “very, very upsetting”.“Those opportunities for networking are incredibly important, meeting those people is a huge part of the degree,” she said. “How am I mean to make friends sat in a dorm room?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea8a1746bb8c8c155fc0f2179a72e6ba2b9a3ba/0_31_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ac5fc44c1ddf3264c9e223e136b3e9","title":"kim kardashian wests face masks provoke controversy","story":"The reality star’s non-medical masks, launched through her shapewear company, suggest the line between fashion and necessity is becoming increasingly blurredThe reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is the latest designer to capitalise on the coronavirus crisis by launching a line of face masks – and has sparked a race row in the process.Launched over the weekend under the celebrity’s shapewear label, Skims, the non-medical seamless masks come in five skin tones and reportedly sold out in less than 30 minutes. There is now a waiting list for them.But their runaway success came hand in hand with accusations of “casual racism”, according to some on social media, who pointed out that one of the masks was not the right nude shade for a black model. The Skims site has now changed the model and the mask she wears. Skims had not responded to the ’s request for comment at time of publication.Skims announced that it would donate 10,000 masks to various local relief charities in Los Angeles, where wearing a mask is mandatory if physical distancing is not possible. This public act of generosity has been widely reported, alongside news of sales.A host of other fashion brands have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by rearranging their supply chains to manufacture masks and other pieces of personal protective equipment, in many cases not for profit. At the same time, some large profit-making companies have been accused of “coronawashing” or using the pandemic as a public relations vehicle. Others, such as ASOS and Boohoo, have faced criticism for profiteering from the crisis by making “fashion masks” in leopard and paisley prints that offer little or no proven protection.The Skims masks cost $8 each, and are available in colours named sand, clay, sienna, cocoa and onyx. Given that the masks are “non-medical” – the website cautions that the mask is “not a respirator and will not eliminate the risk of contracting disease or infection” – wearing them would appear to be as much about style as pandemic precaution.There is concern that should mask-wearing become mandatory, this line between necessity and fashion statement is going to blur, and this arm of the industry will get bigger. The masks currently sit under “accessory” on the shapewear label’s site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1361e5ffb5bd7bbf31ad561e15a05d069c8aba/0_398_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=224c78ef2e0f2ed9beff103fab6fec13","title":"ive never seen sleepless in seattle","story":"Nora Ephron’s world maybe narrowly middle class and privileged, but in this romcom classic she beautifully balances melancholy with fizzing optimismI love a romcom. Place me in front of a Richard Curtis film for the 100th time and I am more than happy. Teach me how to Forget Sarah Marshall, Lose a Guy in 10 Days or just be a girl, in front of a boy, asking him to love her and I’m sold.But here’s the rub. I’ve never seen a Nora Ephron movie. Well, none of the classics the troika of American romcoms that set the template producers have followed for the last 30 years.Why? Well I always assumed they would feel outdated. It’s relatively easy to watch Frank Capra’s screwball comedies without imposing a 21st-century social lens on to them, but it’s harder for products from the late 1980s and 90s.Much like the elements of Friends that have aged badly, I was concerned that Ephron’s world would feel glib and caught between times. Caught in an era when technology – something that has undeniably changed the way we experience romance (and everything else besides) – was neither non-existent nor pervasive. I feared there would be one too many stereotypes, one too many references that flew clean over my mid-90s head, and that the film would fail as both rom and com.Then I watched Sleepless in Seattle.How is it so sad, but so happy? It takes the avatar for Hollywood’s hope – Tom Hanks – but makes him jaded and completely resigned to a future without love. It takes the sparky Meg Ryan and places her with a fiance who is … well, fine. Yet, it is the balance of melancholy and fizzing optimism that underpins every word of Ephron’s gorgeous screenplay.In case you are also in the dark, Sleepless in Seattle tracks Sam Baldwin (Hanks) as he attempts to create a new life for himself and his son, Jonah, following the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Annie Reed (Ryan) is a journalist who is in a perfectly serviceable relationship with the earnest, if bumbling, Walter (Bill Pullman).When Jonah calls up a late-night radio show and asks the host to help his father find love, Sam is forced on to the airwaves. Sam hasn’t been able to catch a wink in Washington since the death, but it’s something he’s accepted. Love came for him once and that’s enough.After hearing this by chance (or fate), Annie is snapped by a moment of pure electricity. She then proceeds to stalk Sam and Jonah, using an undeniably creepy private investigator, but that is beside the point and really misses the heart of the film so I think we should just move on.One of the bravest things about the film is that the protagonists don’t meet until over an hour in. Their connection is played out on a deeper level. Much like the way Joe and Kathleen connect during You’ve Got Mail, Ephron leans into the idea that love can be at first sight, sound or email.After completing the trilogy (When Harry Met Sally and You’ve Got Mail), a few things become clear. Yes, Ephron’s world is indeed a narrowly middle class and privileged one. It is full of New Yorker-reading New Yorkers leading successful and materially fulfilled lives. But the desire to find something else, the thing that will push them from surviving to truly living, is irresistible.Ephron’s elegance stems from her ability to put words and actions to the oldest aphorism in the book, “when you know, you know”. Often, this is a result of the smallest details. It is to Ephron’s – and Rob Reiner’s – enormous credit that when you go back to the beginning and see the inception of so many tropes, that they still shake with such human emotion.Perhaps the issue is that romcoms since have taken away the wrong message. Harry’s final speech to Sally is note perfect but has become the template for how you finish a romcom. The statement of love, even though the protagonists drive each other crazy. Bad romcoms overly focus on the performative acts of love as opposed to the muted.Ephron (and Curtis in Britain) defined the romcom world for 30 years and only now is it changing. The Big Sick, Love Simon, Always Be My Maybe and more have shifted the focus of what a romcom should be, and have done so wonderfully. There will always be space for Ephron’s world, but the reality is that Love, Actually is all around (sorry everyone)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e312f7c296e44cebfcedb09a4d8cd76860324294/0_401_6124_3676/master/6124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54569353936ae37d7fbc7a158ccbdaf9","title":"kim joys recipe for sticky toffee pudding and a biscuit groundhog","story":"The current situation demands comfort food – and friendly biscuit groundhogsSticky toffee pudding is the comfort food we need right now and groundhogs reflect how I feel, since every day seems to be merging into one. So here is a combination of the two. As always, the decoration is optional.

Place in a bowl and pour over the boiling water. Leave to soak for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Generously butter the 200ml pudding moulds. Sieve some flour over the top and shake off the excess.Cream together the butter and sugar (it is fine if it’s a little grainy). Add the treacle and whisk again. Add the eggs slowly (a few tablespoons at a time), whisking well after each addition. Add the self-raising flour and bicarbonate of soda. Whisk until just combined (don’t over mix).At this point, pour the dates and water into a food processor and blend until mostly smooth. Or you can mash them with a fork.Add the blended dates to the cake batter, and then add the milk. Whisk until just combined. The mixture will look curdled – that is normal.Divide between the moulds, and bake for around 25 to 30 minutes, or until springy on top. (While they are baking is a good time to make the groundhog decoration). Leave to cool in the tins while you make the sauce.Add the butter, sugar, treacle and cream to a saucepan. Heat over medium heat and keep stirring until all the butter has melted and it is smooth.Run a knife around the edge of the pudding tins and turn out on to a plate. Pour over the toffee sauce. Add decoration if desired. Eat straight away. Or keep well covered and reheat later to serve.For the groundhog decorationUse a knife to carefully trim your chosen biscuit into shape. Make the water icing: mix the icing sugar with a very small amount of water – just a few drops at a time – until it comes together as a smooth, pipeable icing.Place a third into a piping bag. Then dye the remaining icing light brown. Put half of this into a second piping bag. Then add black food dye to the remaining icing, and transfer this to a third piping bag.Use the white icing to carefully attach flaked almonds to create the ears. Then pipe on the face (adding edible eyes, or piping these on). Use small pieces of flaked almonds to create the teeth. Pipe the black icing to outline the biscuit and ears.For the “soil”, crumble up a chocolate biscuit or a plain biscuit mixed with a little cocoa powder. Sprinkle the edible soil on top of the pudding, and then place the groundhog on top, pressing down so that it sticks into the pudding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7971deefdff99f84736a258dcd6dc0cbba65f92/0_0_5020_3012/master/5020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=174b4762c8f05632c83c37a68f7293aa","title":"i am trying to drink less but know a simple pleasure when i see one","story":"Having spied some beer taps outside a pub, I had to arrange a sociable walk to investigateYesterday morning, I passed a pub near my home while on my motorbike. Two blokes were wheeling out what looked like mobile beer taps. You’ve got to beware distractions like this when you’re on a motorbike, but after a quick, curious glance and a lick of the lips I refocused and motored on.I went home and resumed my seat in front of a laptop where I am endeavouring to write a book: working title, How to Drink Less. Concentration was even harder to come by than usual all I could think about was those beer taps.I have been strangely responsible during lockdown. Having already brought my intake down from historic and dangerous highs, I have actually been drinking less than ever. But now a craving overwhelmed me. They might have just been taking that contraption out to clean but, if not … As I sat there trying to write about drinking less, all my mind’s eye saw was condensation forming on the beer pipes.Later in the day, I had arranged to meet an old friend, from the pre-lockdown era, for a walk. Accidentally on purpose, I had us wander in the direction of the pub.“Where are we going?” he asked.“Oh, erm, I think they’re selling draught beer outside the Duchess,” I said, with scant nonchalance.There was Peroni and there was Guinness. We got a stout each and, abiding by the pourer’s instructions not to linger, we repaired to a nearby park. We sat at either end of a rickety bench beneath a low-hanging tree and carefully removed the lids from our plastic pint glasses. With slow reverence, we took our sips and gave thanks for this simple pleasure.I am all for taking alcohol off the pedestal on which it stands for many of us, but this was something special. We talked as we sipped, and then we went home, exemplars of mindful, moderate drinking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/312ebba750f7c58408ed1852668115a03fc09569/0_159_2873_1724/master/2873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec114ab5f7a68b158ca85fb185e1f8a","title":"atalanta gian piero gasperini serie a","story":"The manager on turning his club from relegation candidates to Champions League quarter-finalists – and living through Covid-19 in BergamoGian Piero Gasperini is getting animated. Atalanta’s manager is talking about how he motivates players. He describes how he often puts up messages in the changing room and one of the most recent, he says, was from Michael Jordan: “Twenty-six times, I have been trusted with the final shot and I missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And this is why I succeed.”Gasperini pauses and says: “But the best one is about the wolf pack.” The wolf pack? “I posted a picture of a wolf pack in the changing room. There are wolves at the front, some in the middle and one at the back. The ones up front can set the pace in the beginning. The next wolves are the strongest, they are the ones who must protect everyone if they are attacked. The ones in the centre are always protected.“Then there are another five strong ones further back to protect an attack from there. The last one is the boss and he ensures no one is left behind. He keeps everyone united and is always prepared to run everywhere to protect the whole group. The message is that a leader doesn’t just stay up front he takes care of the team and this is what I want from my players.”It is an unusual message to send a group of highly-paid professionals but it is working. What Gasperini wants from his players, he gets. Before coronavirus struck, Atalanta were having the best season in their 113-year-old history. They are one of four teams through to the Champions League quarter-finals – with Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig and Atlético Madrid – and on course to qualify for next season’s competition.Then there are the goals. They have scored the most in Italy since the start of last season. This campaign there have been 70 in 25 league games. Three times they have scored seven – against Udinese, Torino and Lecce. Two of those games were away. Milan and Parma were beaten 5-0.Gasperini is relentless in his demands, not unlike Jürgen Klopp. Training is merciless and some players have not enjoyed it. Christian Vieri once said that Gasperini “will destroy you in training” but Atalanta’s manager says: “During training, my players need to struggle those who aren’t used to working hard scare me. But from the struggle, victories are born. If you don’t run in training then you don’t run during the game. Then, of course it is important to have fun in training too because from that comes the style of play and the quality.”Gasperini has created a remarkable team from an unusual set of players. The captain is the remarkable Papu Gómez, a 32-year-old Argentinian who joined from Metalist Kharkiv for £4m in 2014. Another key forward, Josip Ilicic, is also 32 and arrived from Fiorentina for £5m in 2017.The former Aston Villa goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini, former Middlesbrough midfielder Marten de Roon and Mario Pasalic, a Croat who belongs to Chelsea but has found a home in Bergamo on his fifth loan away from the London club since joining in 2014, are other key components. Robin Gosens arrived from Ereisie side Heracles for less than £1m, yet is one of Europe’s most sought-after left-backs now while Bergamo-born Mattia Caldara is back at Atalanta after spells at Juventus and Milan and has been outstanding at centre-back.These players are in the best form of their lives, but why? “There is a secret,” the 62-year-old Gasperini says. “When you reach the maturity necessary to understand that hard work leads to results, you no longer feel tired. Let’s not lose track of the fact that footballers don’t train as hard as other athletes, where the training is tough and intense. My players must think of that and go at it harder. We never had the means for big investments, so we had to find young players in Europe with the same philosophy: able to adapt to our style of play, winning mentality, offensive-minded and willing to work hard. Those who believe in that is one of us, those who are afraid leave.”Gómez once said Gasperini trains players so hard that a match feels like a day off. “With Papu we are talking about an extraordinary player who had not achieved his potential because he never trained well,” Gasperini says. “When he started training better he raised his level to become one of the best in Europe. He wasted time because training makes you into a champion: he always had everything to become one.“Ilicic is another one. We used to call him ‘Josip the Grandma’ because he was just going around being nice to everyone. We had to convince him to increase his efforts at training. He was missing that mental step but once he changed his mindset we stopped calling him grandma, now we call him ‘The Professor’. He realised that every training session is fun and from that decision he was reborn. Five goals in the Champions League this season is a superb effort.”Life has not always been straightforward for Gasperini. After a decent playing career, which started at Juventus’ youth teams and included 59 Serie A appearances for Pescara, he joined Juve’s coaching setup, looking after their under-14s, under-17s and the Primavera squads (under-20s). Successful spells at Genoa earned him the nickname “Gasperson” with a nod to Sir Alex Ferguson because of the team’s style.However, in 2011, when given his chance at a big club, Inter, it went horribly wrong. He lasted less than three months, having failed to win a game, sacked after a demoralising defeat by promoted Novara. As fate would have it though, his dismissal led to one of his favourite moments in football.“I had just been sacked at Inter because I didn’t have the same vision as the management. Then I received a beautiful message: Pep Guardiola wanted to meet me and he invited me to watch his training sessions at Barcelona. It was a very tough moment in my career and to see how an extraordinary manager like Guardiola stayed close to me at that time, it tells you the type of person he is. He made me very happy.”Even at Atalanta, Gasperini initially had problems. At the start of the 2016-17 season the newly appointed manager lost four of his first five league games. There was again talk of the sack when he threw caution to the wind and gave several young players a chance against Napoli, one of the best teams at the time. Atalanta won 1-0 and have not looked back.“I decided to go down this path,” he says. “I’ll make it until the end with my ideas I’m ready to risk everything because I believe in it. We started Mattia Caldara, Roberto Gagliardini, Andrea Petagna and Andrea Conti and other young players with only a few Serie A games between them. We won with a fantastic performance that no one forgets about since that was the beginning of the growth. The beginning for the historical Atalanta way.“I had the idea to play youngsters right away. In Italy, Bergamo is considered a very important place for work, industry and productivity. I wanted to have a project tied to young players, preferably raised in the Atalanta academy, which is exceptional. For too long the backbone of the team was too old so I tried to avoid relegation with a different method: to have full confidence in the young players, develop them and prioritise quality football.”Tactically, Gasperini rarely deviates from 3-5-23-4-3, although there is a lot more positional rotation now. His high-pressing game is unusual for the Italian league. He wants players to look for space and has even told them that watching the referee can help: “Finding space is fundamental for a player so I told them: ‘Look at the referee, he’s never being marked, he’s always in an ideal position to see the game!’ Papu, in particular, has taken on this advice and it has really helped him.”His wife, Cristina, has said that he sometimes wakes in the night and grabs his computers and starts writing notes. “Yes,” he says and laughs. “With my computer at night or with my blackboard I’m always studying for solutions for the next game and only when I believe they will work will we start training.”In Italy, Gasperini has always been seen as the man with the three centre-backs. It has almost defined him. He has been criticised by some for sticking by tactics associated with catenaccio. “I’m proud of this, because I suggested the three-man defence many years ago when I was coaching in Juventus’ youth system. Back then I was told it was too defensive. I proved it was the opposite: the three defenders participate in the run of play, they are trained to be involved offensively.“The formation doesn’t matter, but rather with how many players do you attack or defend. If I had to sum up my defensive philosophy in one phrase it would be that I don’t believe and I will never believe in the concept of waiting for your opponent to make a mistake: I think you must try to steal the ball to attack.”Atalanta finished fourth in 2016-17, seventh the following campaign and third last season to qualify for the Champions League group stage. They started by losing 4-0 at Dinamo Zagreb, 2-1 at home to Shakhtar Donetsk and 5-1 at Manchester City but reached the last 16 by drawing against Manchester City and winning their two remaining games. “I always tell my players: we never lose, we either win or learn,” Gasperini says.Guardiola has said playing against Gasperini’s Atalanta is like “going to the dentist”. The Italian approves: “That is my objective: create a team that would make any opponent struggle. Those who play against us must run a lot and be bothered. I think the dentist metaphor, it is perfect.”Valencia were vanquished 8-4 on aggregate in the Champions League last 16. And then everything stopped. Gasperini remembers returning to Bergamo from the second leg in Spain. “It felt like we were in a country torn apart by war. Everything happened so quickly: just a few days before there was no feeling of what could happen. I remember when we arrived in Valencia, we found a city filled with people celebrating in the streets or outside the stadium, while in Bergamo there were the first indications the situation was critical. When we came back to Bergamo we realised how much had changed in just two days. We went from euphoria to fear in the  of 48 hours.”Gasperini is struggling to find the words to describe the past two months in Bergamo. “This has been something extraordinary, unexplainable with words. Bergamo has been at the centre of this awful coronavirus. It hit our city deeply and caused so many deaths … I’ll never forget the sirens we heard in the centre of Bergamo for the rest of my life.”When matches resume Gasperini knows what he will tell his team. “I will put the emotional aspect right, front and centre. These players have a great bond with Bergamo: the city and the fans. I will talk emotionally and my sentiment will be this: Bergamo suffered a lot, this is our moment to make them smile again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3ba0987f9bcfffa5a996f6705a75e7515615269/159_0_4866_2920/master/4866.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=19e61bc214f2c323d9bf0c6c25032375","title":"uk hot weather and social distancing in pictures","story":"As lockdown restrictions in England were relaxed and temperatures climbed to 28.2C, people headed for beaches and parks, leading to concerns about social distancing.

The majority of the taxable capital gains (£34bn) were received by 9,000 iniduals, who each made gains of £1m or more.The report noted that despite being ignored in official statistics, taxable capital gains were often related to people’s work, and were more akin to earnings from employment than passive investment returns. They include the £24bn of gains eligible for entrepreneurs’ relief and £2bn of ‘carried interest’ – performance bonuses – for fund managers.Dr Andrew Summers, assistant professor at the LSE, said: “Capital gains are taxed at much lower rates than regular income, but the legal line between these is very blurred. This means business managers have a big tax incentive to take their rewards as gains instead of salary or idends. When we look at the types of gain going to people at the very top, that’s exactly what we find. A lot of capital gains are, in fact, just repackaged income going to the already-rich.”Arun Advani, assistant professor at Warwick University said the newly available data also made a difference to the trend in the distribution of income over time.The report noted that capital gains had fallen sharply during the financial crash of 2008-09 and were likely to follow the same pattern during the current crisis. But it questioned whether capital gains should be taxed at a much lower rate than income given that the benefits went mainly to the rich and there was a pressing need for the government to raise revenue.Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said: “This groundbreaking research demonstrates clearly how capital gains reveal an unequal society and the challenge ahead to undo a decade of rising inequality.“This pandemic has shown how many low-paid workers are taking enormous risks to keep us all safe. We must have a fairer settlement after this crisis - with those with the broadest shoulders making more of a contribution”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a98a0b0cfd2a0423b8769a7ec6e8ad0b8ee6945/0_118_2872_1724/master/2872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=735f08ada7337eeecdf14afa6ba41797","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 12 sinead oconnor nothing compares 2 u","story":"Seismic and ethereal, O’Connor’s cover of an obscure Prince track remains a haunting, heartbreaking evocation of lost loveIt’s been 30 years and 142 days since Sinéad O’Connor scaled the charts with Nothing Compares 2 U, her only Top 10 hit. It wasn’t the only anomalous thing about this agonised account of post-breakup malaise: it was a seismic power ballad from an alternative rock star on the ascent a cover from an artist beloved for the intimate, bracing candour of her songwriting. In the accompanying video, O’Connor came over as ethereal and wounded in reality, she would soon earn a reputation as one of the decade’s most fearlessly outspoken figures. Nothing Compares 2 U was an outlier and an instant classic – in many ways, O’Connor never recovered from its success.By the time the 80s ended, O’Connor had established herself as a force to be reckoned with her 1987 debut, The Lion and the Cobra, wove Ireland’s heady folk tradition through spiky new wave to considerable acclaim. O’Connor’s manager, Fachtna Ó Ceallaigh, suggested she record Nothing Compares 2 U for the followup. An obscure album track written by Prince and released by his side project the Family in 1985, in O’Connor’s hands it was an obvious hit: the magisterial simplicity of the vocal melody shining over a spare and slightly schmaltzy instrumental. There were more devastating moments on her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got (in particular Three Babies, a song about miscarriage), but, on Nothing Compares, O’Connor gave one of the most compelling vocal performances in pop history: shattered but single-minded, distraught yet disgusted by the idea of leaving her heartbreak behind. She’s so convincing – especially in the video, famous for the real tears she cries – that it feels almost ghoulish to witness.According to the Family vocalist, Paul Peterson, Prince “didn’t like” O’Connor’s version. The animosity didn’t end there: in 1991, O’Connor began telling an anecdote in which Prince threatened her with violence at his home. Startlingly, O’Connor’s four-week stint at No 1 meant Nothing Compares 2 U outperformed all of Prince’s releases in the UK (and, in the US, only When Doves Cry was a bigger chart success), which may well have been a cause for consternation. The fact Prince released a new, live version in 1993 might count as harder evidence of his displeasure.O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U is clearly superior to all the versions that came from Prince’s camp. On the Family’s stilted and strangely apathetic rendition, the verses are spliced with harmonies that spill over into a duet, while Prince’s 1993 recording is a full-blown call-and-response with collaborator Rosie Gaines: both convey a togetherness that undermines the insulated sadness of the lyrics. (Prince’s original version, recorded in 1984, is punctuated by similarly jarring funky flourishes.) O’Connor also changed the arrangement of the chorus, shifting the “to you” into a dissonantly beautiful monotone and spiking the pitch of “nothing” on the titular lyric – melodic tweaks that communicate despair with minimal frills.By drawing out the emotional weight that eluded its creator, O’Connor fashioned one of the all-time great cover versions. There was a price. Its evergreen appeal – charting as recently as 2012, its video still a music channel staple – and its deviation from the rest of her work fragmented O’Connor’s career: it made more sense to view her as a one-hit wonder than a multifaceted musician. O’Connor’s troubling behaviour in the intervening years, from incendiary political protest to Twitter cries-for-help, has arguably overshadowed even her biggest hit. In musical terms, however, time has only cemented Nothing Compares 2 U’s place in the pop pantheon. Three decades on, this haunting, heart-wrenching evocation of the grief of lost love remains peerless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e4627447f3152b3a1f64d2eea5563eb863cff9/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292598d450c3dedc4a233bd98e20b8e0","title":"how coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels","story":"Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales.

There have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years, according to the Institute for Government.“Ministerial directions have been sought and granted to exceed departmental expenditure limits authorised by parliament for 2019-20 to support urgent spend and because it had not been possible for departments to carry out as full an appraisal of the value for money of some schemes as would usually be undertaken,” the report said.A report released on Thursday found that the government had pledged more than £124bn in extra spending to tackle the virus and its economic consequences. A week ago, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body responsible for forecasting the public finances, said the measures would total £123bn, up from £103bn in late April.Auditors found that ministers made more than 500 announcements between 31 January and 4 May on its response to the pandemic. Of the £124.3bn of programmes, initiatives and spending commitments, £111.3bn was for grants and other payments, £5bn for loans, and £8bn for increases to benefits. The figure does not include the loss of receipts to the Treasury worth an estimated £4.4bn, most of which takes the form of deferred tax payments.Among the spending commitments made by the government was £6.6bn for health and social care measures, which was dwarfed by a promise of £82.2bn for businesses. Another £19.5bn was pledged to support iniduals through measures such as benefits, and £15.8bn for other public services.Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “The scale and nature of the Covid-19 pandemic and the government’s response is unprecedented in recent history. This report outlines the range of measures taken by government to date and where financial support has been targeted.“It also forms the basis for a substantial programme of independent reports from the National Audit Office to parliament and the public on how the money has been spent and the lessons learned.”In a separate development, figures released on Wednesday showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit increased to 2.1 million in April.

The responder community is exhausted – floods, Novichok, terrorism, Brexit preparations, etc. The last thing we need is a no-deal Brexit.“If we are to do recovery properly we do not have the space to start scaling-up a Brexit response too. This needs to be fed into HM government thinking now. This isn’t proanti-Brexit – it is about being sensible for the recovery process and the health and wellbeing of our responders.”The 76-page report marked “officialsensitive” was drawn up by the C-19 Foresight group, a cross-government team which supports local resilience forums in England and Wales. The 42 regional LRFs are tasked with planning and responding to major incidents and catastrophic events.The Brexit warnings came out of broader discussions with over 200 local police, fire, NHS and council services around whether LRFs could effectively manage the pandemic if the country was hit by a simultaneous emergency on a large scale, such as major flooding.One contributor to the review said: “A concurrent emergency of any nature would overwhelm resources, albeit I have no doubt we would endeavour to continue delivering, but at what cost?”There was a widespread feeling that LRFs must be properly funded by the government and could no longer rely on the goodwill of local partners alone. There was frustration that during the current crisis they had been at the back of the queue for key resources.One respondent said: “The NHS are understandably a priority, but other key agencies, particularly those attending deaths in the community (police, fire, medics, funeral directors) have had difficulties in accessing PPE. It’s not just PPE, there has been a critical shortage of body bags, with suppliers providing them at 10 times the normal price.”The review expanded on concerns over the government’s controlling approach and failure to communicate vital Covid-19 information and intelligence to local response teams, which first emerged in a shorter version of the report highlighted by the  last week.It said LRFs felt isolated from national decision-making and were unable to effectively plan their response, adding: “Where there was sharing of data and guidance from central government, the way in which it was managed appeared to create additional confusion.”There was frustration that local emergency teams often only found about government plans when they read about them in the press. One respondent said: “Government needs to actually consult about what is planned, not simply announce something at a press conference and expect it to work the next day.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Councils, local resilience forums and other local partners are doing invaluable work in their communities across the country with support from government. They are a highly trusted and valued community which has regular contact with ministers and officials.“We share information from across government along with key data on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with them to understand any pressures they are facing in their important work so they can make the appropriate plans for their local areas.“We left the EU with a deal on 31 January this year.

The Welsh government has been reported to the Equality and Human Rights Commission over its handling of coronavirus testing in care homes.The country’s older people’s commissioner, Helena Herklots, told BBC Wales she believed the human rights and right to life of care home residents had been breached due to delays in expanding testing in the sector.Quoted by the BBC, Herklots said:I have serious concerns that older people’s human rights have been breached the fundamental right to life. The fact that testing wasn’t in place as quickly as it needed to be for every resident and every member of staff.I’m extremely disappointed and saddened that the Welsh government hasn’t moved quickly on this. That is why I believe the Equality and Human Rights Commission needs to investigate how older people have been treated throughout this pandemic.Wales’s health minister, Vaughan Gething, defended his government’s actions by saying that the advice and evidence was that there “wasn’t a value” in testing people who were not symptomatic.“We changed the approach that we took on testing people who were leaving hospital on April 22 onwards,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The Welsh government has now expanded its testing programme so that every care home in Wales will have access to testing and be able to order online testing kits for residents and staff. Previously only residents and staff in care homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus were tested, as were homes with more than 50 beds, anyone being discharged from hospital into a care home, or anyone moving into a care home from the community.Staying in Scotland for a moment, the deputy first minister John Swinney has said the country faces “a challenging situation” in care homes due to testing capacity.Appearing on the Today programme, Swinney was asked if all care workers in infected homes in Scotland were now being tested, he replied: “They are eligible for testing now, yes.”Pressed further, he said: “Well, they should be able to get the test because they are eligible to get it and there is plenty of testing capacity available.”The Scottish government has recruited 600 people to undertake contact tracing and was aiming to get 2,000 in place in total.On the 2,000, he said: “We won’t need them on day one when we start this process, but at the end of this month when we want to be in a position to deliver a contact-tracing strategy, that will be able to be delivered in Scotland.”Heriot-Watt university is to remove a controversial stone sculpture commissioned by Alex Salmond pledging Scotland would never abandon free tuition, after fee-paying students objected to its message.The sculpture quoted Salmond’s statement as first minister that “the rocks will melt with the sun before I allow tuition fees to be imposed on Scotland’s students”, and was placed on the access road into Heriot-Watt’s campus on the outskirts of Edinburgh.The university, along with the rest of its sector, faces significant financial problems due to the coronavirus pandemic with an expected collapse in the number of overseas and EU students attending UK universities.It is understood foreign students were unhappy with it since they pay thousands of pounds a year in fees. Although Scottish students pay no fees, those from the rest of the UK also pay up to £9,250 a year to study in Scotland.Until Brexit, EU students were also exempt from paying tuition fees in Scotland, due to a quirk of EU law. Scottish ministers now have to decide whether to require fees from EU students after the UK’s transition period finishes in January 2021.Heriot-Watt was ridiculed by critics for allowing the sculpture to be installed due to its bombastic tone and highly political message. It was erected during Salmond’s final days in office after he lost the independence referendum in 2014. It was reported at the time that other universities refused to accept it.Following consultation with Heriot-Watt university student union, a decision has been taken to use the current location of the commemorative stone for an alternative public art work which will appeal to our international student community. The stone will be carefully looked after until an alternative location is found for it in future.0Another issue weighing on the government this morning is that of the NHS surcharge – the fees some overseas health workers are charged to use the NHS.A senior Tory MP, William Wragg, has backed Labour’s calls for the charge to be scrapped, saying that “now is the time for a generosity of spirit towards those who have done so much good”.Wragg, who is chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said he was “sure” that his Conservative colleagues would be supportive of his stance.Immigrants from outside the European Economic Area – often including NHS cleaners, porters and other healthcare staff – are required to pay an NHS surcharge of £400 a year, rising to £624 from October.On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, James Brokenshire was repeatedly asked whether the government would get rid of the charge. His answer, to paraphrase, was probably not: We continue to keep this under review but the principle of the NHS surcharge, the support that it provides financially to the NHS and indeed that sense of contribution to the NHS, I think is important.My esteemed colleague Sarah Boseley has written a very good explainer on the government’s test, track and trace strategy, which is dominating the headlines this morning. But in brief, the strategy aims to:Central to this plan has been a new NHS app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the app would be ready to start being rolled out in mid-May. However, ministers now say it won’t be ready until the next few weeks. The clock, as NHS figures are saying this morning, is very much ticking. The government’s own scientific advisers say that a comprehensive and rapid test, track and trace system is crucial to any easing of the lockdown.Security minister James Brokenshire is touring the TV and radio studios for the government this morning. Responding to concerns from NHS leaders about delays to the test, track and trace system, Brokenshire insists he is “confident” that it will be in place by 1 June (11 days from now).Brokenshire told Sky News that the app “will be introduced in the coming weeks in parallel” with the system employing track and trace staff. He added: But obviously, the priority being to get these track and tracers trained, in place, that is what the prime minister is very confident about. We’re confident the system will be there, able to track and trace around 10,000 people on 1 June.Pushed on whether the app is needed to competently track and trace, Brokenshire told Kay Burley: “Of course Kay, we want to see the app rolled out, work continues at pace in relation to that, learning from the experience in the Isle of Wight, so that that can be adopted more broadly.” Brokenshire added that the app provides “extra support”.Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS providers – which represents hospital trusts – has said the health service risks being “overwhelmed” in a second peak of Covid-19 unless ministers quickly set out a clear strategy for its test, track and trace programme.He said NHS Trusts, GPs and workers on the 111 service have “not had clear information and instructions about what their role will be in this process”.We need clarity on exactly how this is going to work. Our colleagues at the Confederation are right: unless we can absolutely have clarity on that quickly, there clearly will be a risk to the NHS that we get overwhelmed in a second peak, which nobody wants.Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK developments on the coronavirus pandemic.Leading the headlines today are NHS leaders warning that the government is running out of time to launch its test and trace system if a possible second wave of coronavirus is to be avoided.Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation - which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, wrote to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, because his members were “concerned” over an apparent lack of a clear strategy.“We would therefore urge you to produce such a strategy with a clear implementation plan ahead of any further easing of the lockdown,” Dickson said in his letter.Test, track and trace - TTT - means testing people for coronavirus, tracking the spread of the virus, then tracing the people with whom an infected person has come into contact. The government’s own scientific advisers have said such a system is critical to any lifting of the lockdown.We will bring you all the day’s developments from the Commons and beyond.

Announced on 15 May, the accords are a set of broad themes that the agency hopes will form the basis of agreements to be negotiated with each country involved in the effort to land the next humans on the moon by 2024.Based in part on the UN’s outer space treaty of 1967, the Artemis accords reassert that all activities should be undertaken only for peaceful purposes, and add that all plans should be communicated transparently with no secrecy. They commit the partners to using open international standards to allow machinery and equipment to function easily together, to provide emergency assistance to other astronauts and to mitigate the creation of space debris.Where the accords are likely to become controversial is that they appear to allow the use of lunar resources for commercial gain, and they seek to establish “safety zones” around landing sites, which could be interpreted as de facto ownership of areas of the moon, which is forbidden by the outer space treaty.

In just one week in April, more people signed up to volunteer to sort, pack and deliver food for FareShare than in the whole of last year.To help store and manage the additional food, the charity has recently secured another nine warehouses’ worth extra capacity. It is now urging the government to cover the costs to producers and growers of saving surplus food from waste and sending it to charities, in order to tackle an expected rise in food poverty during and after the crisis.Lindsay Boswell, the chief executive of FareShare, said: “When the crisis ends, the need for our food will still be there. In April alone 856,500 more people claimed benefits and job opportunities fell by a quarter. Many more people will fall through the gaps in society and need the support of frontline charities.”Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness in the UK. The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food, according to data from the Food Foundation.The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We continue to support redistribution organisations getting food to those in need through our work with the Wrap Resource Action Fund. Most recently we provided a series of grants to help redistribution organisations both large and small respond to the impact of coronavirus. We will look to evaluate an earlier pilot programme and any further funding decisions will be made in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/800d24817074d11a0ca8990f29a2cc3418db49e0/0_61_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e596788128bfa03d14196ad1dcd4f714","title":"the last dance espn lebron james michael jordan nba","story":"I was born and raised in Chicago and idolized Jordan growing up. But, unexpectedly, The Last Dance has made me gravitate towards LeBronI am hard pressed to name another athlete who has dominated my life quite like Michael Jeffrey Jordan. You see, I was born in Chicago a few years before he arrived in town and I came of age as he himself blossomed from a college hero into a global icon. Somewhere deep inside an armoire drawer, I have a t-shirt that reads: “Sorry Sir Charlie, You Can’t Be Like Mike” – a disintegrating curbside souvenir from Game 3 of the 1993 NBA finals, one of a dozen-odd Bulls games I was lucky enough to attend during the team’s storybook run. When ESPN announced plans for The Last Dance documentary, I felt vindicated. Here, at last, was the Air-tight argument that would put basketball’s all important greatest of all time debate to rest. LeBron James stans would have no choice but to bow down to the man who unironically calls himself “Black Jesus”.Rightfully, I should be basking in Jordan’s mandate. But truth be told I have never been more conflicted.When I was a kid, it was enough to take Jordan at face value. As far as I knew, he was an otherworldly basketball player whose vast skill owed as much to natural talent as sweat equity, and whose clutch gene traced to a never-say-die attitude. Sure, there were reports of him sparring with management and tangling with teammates. And sure, there was more recent evidence of him snubbing selfie-seeking rappers, stiffing kids out of free Air Jordans and doubling down on grudges in maybe the most bitter hall of fame speech ever delivered. But it was difficult to argue with the results.Forget growing the NBA globally. Jordan was an excuse to put off homework for a few hours, a reason to get together with friends – a blissful ersion for me as my parents went through a lengthy orce. He was an uncomplicated superstar for a relatively quiet time in history when wars were over in a month and the greatest question facing humanity was whether Ross and Rachel would end up together. It was clear to everyone that we were living in a moment.But now that the moment has passed, who could appraise Jordan on his basketball skill alone anymore? As much as The Last Dance tried to keep a tight focus on the court, with Jordan the executive producer hand-checking the viewer all the while, I couldn’t help but note the many belittling references to his “supporting cast” or the villainizing of Bulls GM Jerry Krause – who, it should be noted, is dead and unable to defend himself. I watched Jordan dismiss his 80s-era teammates as womanizing cokeheads and take pride in bullying benchwarmer Scott Burrell and Steve Kerr. I watched him explain away his famous “Republicans buy sneakers too” line as a joke.More to the point: I watched Jordan speak adoringly about his parents and brother and the off-duty Chicago cops in his entourage without really making much mention of his three adult children. In fact, I was convinced that was where the documentary was headed after Jordan’s passionate soliloquy on the price of winning. But the kids only appear briefly toward the end of the series. Certainly, when it came to shutting out the distractions of the world, nobody did it better than MJ. But we don’t live in that world anymore. Hence why, an adult now, I find myself gravitating more and more toward James.At worst James is the single greatest success story in team sports, a child prodigy who not only overcame the hardscrabble circumstances of his youth but fulfilled every expectation that was ever foisted upon him. And then he went well beyond even that. He forced his high school friends on his early money minders, and today they are part of his billion-dollar enterprise. He married his high school sweetheart and can reliably be seen embarrassing his three kids on the family’s Taco Tuesday night he waffles openly between kicking himself for passing his name to his first born-son and flogging himself to hang around the league long enough to play with him. He denounces the unjust killings of unarmed black men, tangles with the commander-in-chief – he built a school in his hometown before jetting off to Los Angeles, for goodness sakes. At the very least he should have drawn even with Jordan in the ESPN poll’s “positive off-court impact” category.As for on the court, well, James sees himself more clearly as MJ’s teammate than his rival. “Me personally, the way I play the game – team first – I feel like my best assets work perfectly with Mike,” James said in a video released Monday on Uninterrupted’s YouTube channel. “It would’ve been a whole ‘nother level with me being that point forward alongside of him during those Chicago runs.”Doubtless many old school basketball fans will read that statement as an indictment of the present generation of NBA stars who would sooner consolidate primacy in free agency than battle one another for it on court. And 10-year-old me probably would have scoffed at it, too. But now that I’m four times as old and a father myself? How could I not think the guy who builds bridges would make a better role model for my son than the guy who would torch anything that lies in his path?That is not to say one player is better than the other. On that score it’s a shame that basketball isn’t more like football, where intergenerational talents are seen for what they truly are: descendants of the same line. Just as there’s no Tom Brady without Joe Montana, there’s no LeBron without Jordan. There’s no Kobe Bryant, a GOAT challenger whose copycatting of Jordan I once found as grating as nails on a chalkboard. But when Bryant explained, in footage shot for The Last Dance before his death this year, that his career was essentially a love letter to Jordan, all I could take away was regret. Clearly, eternal greatness doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. It could just be a pleasant distraction, a standard to aspire. It could just be a body of work to appreciate in its time that encapsulated a moment that won’t soon be forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f436105599a35d2a154b627f7e5dfa34b9d0de92/0_174_2470_1483/master/2470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b066017fa711ef1bcf1101db1a0a7b2","title":"tokyo olympics 2021 last chance agrees ioc chief","story":"Thomas Bach says he understands comments by Japanese PM that 2021 is the ‘last option’The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach, has warned that the Tokyo Games would have to be scrapped if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible for them to take place next year.The IOC and the Tokyo Olympic organising committee announced in March that the Games, which were due to open this July, would have to be postponed by a year due to the global spread of the virus.Bach told the BBC on Thursday he agreed with Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who said last month that holding the Games would be “difficult” unless the pandemic was contained before they are due to begin on 23 July next year.Bach said Abe had made it clear to him that, as far as Japan was concerned, next year was “the last option”.“Quite frankly, I have some understanding for this, because you can’t forever employ 3,000 or 5,000 people in an organising committee,” Bach said. “You can’t every year change the entire sports schedule worldwide of all the major federations. You can’t have the athletes being in uncertainty.”Bach added, however, that the IOC was committed to holding the Olympic Games in the Japanese capital next year, even though the outbreak could force organisers to take precautions, including quarantining athletes.The director general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, conceded at the weekend that it would “not be easy” for 11,000 athletes from more than 200 teams to compete safely in Tokyo.“We hope Tokyo will be a place where humanity will gather with triumph against Covid,” Tedros said at a news conference in Geneva on Saturday. “It is in our hands, but it is not easy. If we do our best, especially with national unity and global solidarity, I think it’s possible.”With more than 17,100 cases and 797 deaths, Japan has avoided the huge coronavirus toll seen in other countries, but plans to host the Games in just over a year’s time could be frustrated by more worrying outbreaks in other parts of the world.The WHO warned on Thursday that the pandemic was far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide in the previous 24 hours – the most in a single day so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfae06176f4540e9a6a7f50d719033a7e10be96a/15_187_3604_2163/master/3604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f2206ba7232650f693d2eaed6ee237a","title":"animal zoom calls coronavirus lockdown","story":"From throwing an alpaca party to adding a goat to a work call, video calling is providing a financial lifeline for businessesWhile the rest of the world has been in lockdown, the goats of Cronkshaw Fold farm in Lancashire have never been busier. In the past few weeks they’ve been to a rave in Berlin and a birthday party in New Zealand, while Mary goes to church services every Sunday – all virtually, of course.They’re one of an increasing variety of animal breeds people can now book to join their Zoom meetings, whether it’s to break the tedium of a work conference call or to surprise someone on their birthday.“We started it as a bit of a joke really, and then we got inundated with messages,” said farmer Dot McCarthy. They now have capacity to do up to 100 Zoom calls a day, charging £5 for a 10-minute appearance.“I’m on the phone all day and people are just in hysterics because they’ve sneaked a goat into the business meeting and the boss hasn’t noticed,” said McCarthy. “It’s so ridiculous, it’s complete escapism. At the moment people just want something completely surreal so they can forget about everything else.”The goats are all in pens as it is kidding season, making them convenient for filming, but also giving people the added bonus of seeing the newborns. “There was a group of women this morning who were all crying because they just love the baby goats,” McCarthy said.In the US, Sweet Farm in California has animals including llamas available for video meetings, while in Fife, Scotland, Alison Johnson has started offering alpaca parties over Zoom to boost the farm’s income during lockdown.The call is just like any chaotic family video call. New mother Emily bleats calming tones at two-day-old Ethan. Best friends Joseph and Owen are having an argument before playing up for the camera. Stubborn Reginald reluctantly glances at the screen with a scowl, apparently dismissive of the whole enterprise.“The boys are on the whole more confident than the girls,” said Johnson, who runs Bowbridge Alpacas with her husband, son and daughter. “In the boys’ field, you’ll be talking about one alpaca and another alpaca will come up and photobomb. But they are all very friendly, and they all have their own personalities.”During each Zoom party, she introduces a number of the alpacas, talks about their personalities, and reels off interesting facts, covering everything from their mating habits to the consistency of their fleece.The farm offers bronze, silver and gold Zoom packages, which include options to adopt one of the 39 alpacas and add gift vouchers, greeting cards and even a lock of fleece along with the call. It has been a crucial source of revenue for the business, which normally relies on selling wool on the farm and at fairs, and offering alpaca experiences.“The animals still need to be fed, and we still have vet bills,” Johnson said. “But we’ve already made the decision that we’re going to keep doing this when things go back to normal,” adding that it allows family and friends from all over the world to experience something together.A huge range of businesses have turned to video calling as a way to keep their businesses afloat during the lockdown – everything from yoga classes to live events are being transferred to the virtual world.Sedona Ferguson runs Goldilocks, a children’s entertainment company, and has adapted her kids’ birthday parties to work over Zoom.For the younger children, she does musical statues and scavenger hunts, and dresses as princesses and pirates, while her TikTok dance parties – where she teaches viral dance routines – are more popular with the older ones.“I was a little sceptical at first how a birthday party would work online, but I started promoting it on Facebook and it really took off,” she said. “I have had some Zoom calls with about 40 different people on, which is crazy.”Having the parties online allows people to invite relatives from all over the world, some of whom might not have spent a birthday together in years. “I even had one lady message me and say that it was the best party she’s ever had, lockdown or not,” said Ferguson. “It’s something so out of the ordinary and so unlike what we’re used to that … it makes it memorable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfcb9c37da77da5d2deb49b1cec43260dfe8089b/573_425_4368_2622/master/4368.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0e9ff5ed1114fb6f1ff79a9ce8dc891f","title":"huawei matebook x pro review windows 10s macbook pro rival","story":"Pros: great screen, slim and compact, excellent keyboard, great trackpad, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, USB-A, fingerprint scanner, Nvidia MX250Cons: gets hot when on power, no disk encryption out of the box, trackpad rattle, battery life not class-leading, no SD card slot, pop-up webcam has an up-nose angle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

So with that in mind, Fox’s Labor of Love will probably end up as the biggest hit of the summer.Because, and I really can’t stress this enough, Labor of Love is stupid. It is arguably the most knuckleheaded show I have seen in half a decade. You could take this show and bury it in the desert, and people would still be able to locate it from the stench of its utter, logic-defying stupidity. Watching Labor of Love is like pulling your brain out of your ear with a corkscrew and booting it into a lake. Let me try to explain.In textbook dating show fashion, Kristy is a 41-year-old orcee who must choose between 15 different hunks. Together they will, in the words of host Kristin Davis, “skip the dating and go straight to baby-making”. Because, that’s right, Labor of Love is a dating show where the prize is a real life flesh-and-blood baby. The entire show exists to help one woman choose a candidate to impregnate her. It’s a mating show, not a dating show. Love, as we’re told, is optional.Clearly, we were already headed this way. Dating shows cannot simply be dating shows any more. We’ve had Love is Blind, where couples propose to people they haven’t even seen. We’ve had Married at First Sight, where people get married the instant they meet. Of course there was eventually going to be a show about women being impregnated by men they barely know.Labor of Love isn’t necessarily the logical endpoint of the genre – because that’s Sperm Lottery, a reality show of my own invention where a woman repeatedly inseminates herself with random sperm samples sent by anonymous donors, and then marries the father of the child she likes best – but it’s close. It’s another moment of human purity bulldozed by television. To be clear, I hate it.It doesn’t help that the potential fathers all feel like dopey offcuts from other reality shows. They all uniformly, regardless of age or background or race, look like slabs of battered ham. They’re all a bit too dumb, their emotional problems a bit too overt. They say things like “I appreciate the interactions we had” instead of actual human words. They look, obviously, like the sort of people who’d sign up for a reality show about getting a woman pregnant.The format is awful, especially the part where the woman eliminates potential fathers on an iPad app. The house they all live in is awful, not least because one of the rooms is an infantilised man cave called “The Father Hood”. The tasks are all awful, ranging from the annoying (“look after some children at a party”) to the insulting (“get your sperm analysed”) to the apparently randomly generated (“spraypaint negative adjectives on to a car and then beat the car to death with a hammer”). Labor of Love is so terrible that it doesn’t even feel like a television series. It feels like a document designed to be presented to God as an argument for the total eradication of the human race. It feels like an open invitation for the coronavirus.Now, it’s important to point out that I have only seen half of the series. In episodes five, six, seven and eight, there’s a fighting chance that everyone involved in this legitimate horror show comes to their senses and starts to rebel against the system a little. The show does already have something of a backdoor in the first episode we see that Kristy has had her eggs frozen, allowing her the option to back out of the deal and go it alone in the event of her realising that going on a dating show just to get pregnant is arguably the least dignified thing any person could ever do. Hopefully that’s how this ends.But honestly, on the basis of the first four episodes, that isn’t going to happen. She’s going to have a baby with one of these gibbering corned beef statues. Their relationship will falter. The child will grow up and discover how they came into being and embark on an unbreakable cycle of destructive behaviour that leaves a permanent trail of regret behind them. On the basis of the first four episodes, this whole show is nothing but a recipe for suffering. Everyone involved in it should be truly ashamed. To reiterate, I hate it.However, if any Fox executives are interested in paying me for the rights to Sperm Lottery, please get in touch through the usual channels. I have kids to feed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

We’ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July,” he said.“Clearly, we can only do it if it’s safe to do so because I think the worse thing for our tourism sector would be to start, then see the R rate rise out of control, see a second peak that overwhelms the NHS that we then have to slam on the brakes again.“But, believe me, when we get to the point when we can have British tourism back, perhaps apart from the prime minister you won’t get a bigger champion of the great British break than me.”R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.His comments came after Patricia Yates, the acting chief executive of the official tourist agency VisitBritain, warned on Tuesday that the tourism sector expected to lose £37bn from the impact of Covid-19 – a figure that doesn’t factor in the effect of a possible 14-day quarantine for all visitors coming to Britain.A Downing Street spokesman said they were looking at a proposal by the body to add an extra bank holiday to the UK calendar this year, potentially around the school half-term holiday in October, in order to make up for lost earnings from the two May bank holidays spent in lockdown.Dowden also used the briefing to announce that the government planned to use £150m left in dormant bank and building society accounts to help prop up charities and social enterprises responding to the coronavirus crisis.“This funding will support organisations that are at the heart of their communities, building on our unprecedented package of financial support for the voluntary sector,” he said.“Through our proposals to further expand the dormant assets scheme, we want to unlock hundreds of millions more pounds for good causes, while keeping customer protection at the heart of the programme.”The money will be taken from accounts that have lain untouched for 15 years and for which no owner could be found, as part of the government’s dormant assets scheme. The initiative, which gives the proceeds from abandoned accounts to good causes, was launched in 2011. Thirty firms, including all major high street banks, have voluntarily transferred funds to the scheme.The £150m will include accelerating the release of £71m of new funds from dormant accounts alongside £79m that has already been unlocked and will be repurposed to help charities’ coronavirus response and recovery.The money adds to the £750m of extra funding for frontline charities announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in April, a sum described as insufficient to save some third-sector organisations from collapse.Some of the best-known national charities have warned they are in dire straits as revenue from charity shops and fundraising events dries up during the coronavirus lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ac8b2ddfffd517c7cf548a081d971e8850a6d4/0_125_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36e33878bfac8efb38282fa055f357f5","title":"no one had any idea contact tracers lack knowledge about covid 19 job","story":"Employees told to consult YouTube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved personThey were hailed as stepping up to serve their country, with all the “rigorous” and “detailed” instruction needed for such an important role – but a programme to train thousands of contact-tracers to help control the spread of coronavirus has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits.People hired to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 and advise them to self-isolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system, and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles.New contact tracers have been told to rely on a two-page script and a list of frequently asked questions, both seen by the . When one taking part in a training session, run by contact centre company Sitel, asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus, they were reportedly told to look at YouTube videos on the topic.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on Monday that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England, surpassing the initial target of 18,000. “They have rigorous training with detailed procedure designed by our experts at Public Health England,” he said. “They have stepped up to serve their country in their hour of need.”Hancock claimed the government now had “the elements we need to roll out our national test and trace service: the testing capacity, the tracing capability and the technology”.But one man, who asked to remain anonymous, told the  he had spent three days getting paid, but receiving very little information or training.He said he had applied for a job as a “Work at Home – Customer Service Adviser” for £10 an hour, which was advertised on the job website Indeed. He got an email checking he had the right software, and then received a call to tell him what the job entailed and ask when he could start.The people in the training were told they would be acting as agents in the contact-tracing team, working on behalf of PHE. “You will be acting as the first point of contact with the contacts of confirmed positive cases of Covid-19,” they were told in a slide presentation seen by the .They were told they would be calling up confirmed contacts of positive coronavirus cases, recording their data and escalating “more challenging cases” – including people who refused to cooperate – to more senior call handlers.“After the full day of training, people were still asking the most basic things. Someone also asked what they should do if they spoke to someone whose relative had died of the virus and he said we should look on YouTube where there are lots of videos about empathy and sympathy when talking to someone,” said the man.“Then I looked at the rota and it said I was starting the next morning at 9am,” he said. He logged in first thing and received a message saying “sit tight and wait for us to instruct you”. He did nothing all day, but got an email assuring him he would still get paid and was told that he would be doing more training soon.One woman told the  she had been recruited to be a contact tracer and had spent three days trying and failing to log into the Sitel system. “Matt Hancock was saying last night that it was all ready to go,” she said. “It’s not.”Responding to the complaints about contact-tracing training, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care – also speaking on behalf of Sitel – said that recruits were being trained ahead of the rollout, so were not yet expected to make calls.They said that all applicants were interviewed through a combination of online assessments and telephone screening and had to provide Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and Right to Work information. They added that a suggestion to use YouTube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved person would be investigated and was not in line with their training.“Staff are trained on data security, customer service, safeguarding vulnerable children and adults, operating procedures, and when to escalate issues among other matters,” they said. “Only applicants that have passed the training modules and technical tests are allowed to move onto the next stage and start work.”The testimony from contact tracers is the latest sign of problems with the government’s attempt to establish an efficient track, trace and isolate system, to allow the country to return to something close to normal life.On Sunday, ministers were accused by Labour of “misstep after misstep” after contact tracing applicants were told recruitment was on hold while the government considered an alternative app.Emails sent by one of the private-sector companies handling the recruitment process, Kent-based HR Go, said: “Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the ‘Track and Trace’ app itself while the government considers an alternative app.”DHSC said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion”, though a government spokesperson confirmed the next day that the rollout of the app would not take place by the middle of May, as initially promised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c51d7aff87f173723392e979dfd28b73df5aae01/0_39_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49d2fb47ba4b6536358b77751716f4d2","title":"top eu doctor europe should brace itself for second wave of coronavirus","story":"Exclusive: ‘The question is how big,’ says Dr Andrea Ammon, who thinks March skiing breaks were pivotal to spreadThe prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments – including the UK – on disease control.“The question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job title new to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment.And Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, speaks frankly in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began.Earlier this month the former hospital doctor, who worked through the various levels of healthcare bureaucracy to be become ECDC director in 2017, announced that, as of 2 May, Europe as a whole had passed the peak of infections. Only Poland was technically not yet there, she said.European governments have started easing their lockdown restrictions, some to the extent that bars and restaurants will soon reopen, others rather more tentatively. Boris Johnson has tweaked his message to Britons from “stay at home” to “stay alert” and is seeking to send pupils back into schools in a fortnight.Ammon’s job is to scrutinise the fallout and catch any rise in infections early. Talking through Skype from her kitchen at home, from where she has been working remotely for the last two months, she insists a disastrous second wave is not inevitable if people stick to the rules and keep their distance.But she detects an ominous weakening of the public’s resolve.“I think now it’s beginning to strain. What we see is that, on the one hand, the economic part for small and medium-sized businesses but also the experience of people not being able to exercise all the freedoms that we normally have: to go where we like, to be with whom we want to be. And this is a quite fundamental change to our normal way of life.Asked whether the data was showing any repercussions, Ammon gave a deadpan answer. “Not yet. I mean, maybe it doesn’t come ever, maybe all the adjustment of these measures is done in a prudent way. This is something we are really right now are closely monitoring: what is happening after all these measures.”As of Wednesday 158,134 people have died from Covid-19 in the EU and the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, according to ECDC data for the countries the agency monitors.The UK has the highest level of deaths in Europe, with 35,341, followed by Italy (32,169) and France (28,022).A total of 1,324,183 cases of infection have been reported. Among those is a member of Ammon’s own staff. Only a skeleton group of fewer than 10 now work in the agency’s office in Stockholm.“Part of our crisis team that needs to be there because they need very close cooperation. But they’re sitting wide apart. Honestly. We have to do what we preach.”Ammon recalls that it was only in late January that it had become clear that a novel virus causing a cluster of deaths in the Chinese city of Wuhan could be transmitted human to human, with initial concerns focusing on the possibility of the disease spreading through imports.As the extremely contagious nature of the virus emerged, the ECDC advised governments on 26 January to strengthen the capacities of their health services. There was fear of them being overwhelmed, as was shortly to be the case with tragic results in Lombardy in northern Italy.“We did really emphasise that these plans have to be updated. And in particular, the hospital preparedness needs to be looked at, how to make sure to have a surge capacity for beds, in general, but also in particular for intensive care unit beds.Ammon believes that when the inevitable inquiries look into the twists and turns of the crisis, the return of holidaymakers from Alpine skiing breaks in the first week of March will be seen as a pivotal moment in the spread of Covid-19 into Europe.Lockdowns followed – a theoretical possibility in the pandemic planning that few believed was feasible. “I remember when China put the lockdown to Wuhan, people told me, ‘Look this wouldn’t be possible in Europe.’ Hmm.”Now the lockdowns were straining the public’s tolerance, she said, but questioned whether they still came in too late and whether swifter action could have saved more lives. “I believe if we would have put in these measures earlier, it might have been possible, but … these measures are so stark, I mean they are so out of our experience that it, I think it needed … unfortunately the situation in northern Italy to make everybody clear that it is necessary.”Ammon now believes the battle with coronavirus will be a long haul. “I don’t know whether it’s forever but I don’t think it will go away very quickly. It seems to be very well adapted to humans.”She is yet to book a summer holiday and warns those craving a break away to prepare for some disappointment. “What we are saying is that they should be prepared that even if there are some holidays and they go somewhere, it will not be comparable to what they had last year. At this stage we cannot say you can go out there, wash your hands and everything is fine. You have to keep your distance. These measures have to be in place.”But despite the privations of recent months, Ammon expresses little sympathy for the argument put forward by some, including the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption that merely shielding the elderly would have been sufficient."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b33e85dd42fdaab6762649b7005ab117356eb6/0_215_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5b3be922d645bdb5a3f519e165ac357","title":"bring our boys back home rugby team from tonga trapped in new zealand due to covid 19","story":"The 29-strong squad have been sleeping on the floor of an Auckland church and surviving off donated food after Tonga closed its bordersFor the past six weeks, the days have followed a particular pattern for the players and coaching staff of the Tu’uakitau rugby team from Tonga.They get up from their beds – mattresses on the floor of a church in Auckland where they are locked down – pray, sing hymns, eat a breakfast made of donated food, and then train.The 29-strong squad is stuck 2,000km from their home in Tonga, stranded in New Zealand after their Pacific home shut its borders to all travellers, including citizens.The team from Ha’apai, a remote cluster of islands in central Tonga, arrived in New Zealand on 3 March, intending to spend a month playing club rugby teams around the North Island, before heading home.Team Tu’uakitau had spent months preparing for the trip, training, and fundraising. Players were hoping to be scouted for contracts on New Zealand teams a potential pathway to residency for them and their families.A week and a half into the tour, opposition coaches began calling to cancel their upcoming games and they realised the gravity of the Covid-19 situation.“We had $5,000 left in our bank account so we spent all of that to change our flight to go home,” said Tuivaita Ueleni, Tu’uakitau head coach.The flight was booked for 23 March, three weeks after the team arrived and two days before New Zealand’s level-four lockdown began.“We arrived at the airport and were getting ready to fly away and that’s when we found out that we couldn’t go back,” said Ueleni.The Tongan government had made the decision to shut its border, with all scheduled flights to be erted to neighbouring island nations. This left the 29-strong squad of players and coaches facing an impending nationwide lockdown with limited options, and rapidly dwindling funds.“We arrived back at the Tokaikolo ‘ia Kalaisi church with no money in our pockets and the people from the church offered us to stay for free,” said Ueleni.Church members quickly turned the hall of worship into makeshift housing for the team, spreading mattresses across the floor and erecting a volleyball net in the yard to keep them entertained during lockdown.“Nine of the team volunteered to stay with friends or relatives around the city and the 20 of us have been in the church ever since,” said Tevita Vakasiuola, team doctor and assistant coach.To occupy the long days in the church the team has been singing a lot, filling the cavernous hall with their well-practised harmonies.“Every day we pray together and sing hymns. The boys joke that by the time we get home we’ll know every hymn there is,” said Ueleni.Their daily routine has also involved runs up the neighbouring Māngare Mountain, tending to the church gardens, volleyball, and then more prayer again.Tu’uakitau’s 29 members are among the estimated thousands of Pasifika people stuck in New Zealand due to border closures.New Zealand traditionally depends on seasonal workforces from Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu, but with borders closed and work dried up, many foreign nationals have found themselves stranded without a clear understanding of when they can head home.“We have a number of Pasifika people up and down the country who were here on working visas but are no longer able to work and aren’t able to access government support,” said Debbie Sorenson, CEO of Pasifika Futures, a charitable organisation which has helped provide food and shelter to more than 250 stranded Pasifika people.In their temporary home in South Auckland, team Tu’uakitau is surviving on donations until Air New Zealand refunds the last of the money they spent on the flight change. So far they’ve been flooded with masses of food and warm clothing from the local Tongan community, including one family who moved into the church with them to help cook dinners.“It’s part of our culture,” said Auckland-based Tevita Ngata, one of the many members of the Tongan community supporting the team. “There’s not too much strain on any one family because we all pitch in, the whole community takes on the load.”With Tongan borders closed until at least 12 June, more than three months since the team left the Islands, their inability to return has also putting a huge strain on the community back in Ha’apai.“My wife is looking after two kids with another on the way and is working all day at the hospital. It’s very hard not being there for her,” said Vili Ngata, the team’s vice-captain.Players on the team play a significant role in village life on the islands of Ha’apai’, where Tevita Vakasiuola, the team doctor, is one of only two doctors in the region, and all men hunt and gather food for their families.Tevita’s wife Moni Vakasiuola told the  that she is struggling to look after their young twins on the island of Lifuka in his absence.“It’s a very tough time for me with Tevita not here at the moment. He is the only one working and he’s the one that gets the food from the bush,” said Moni.“We need the boys to go out to fish, to get the taro, cassava and yam for the pot. The government needs to open up the border and bring our boys back home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f48162fa02aea920f669a5458a46f1032da400d3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7d045510fd16c775c81eda0647cbe74f","title":"could be a bit strange new zealand bars to reopen but fun is kept at arms length","story":"No live music, no bar, table service only, and a ‘visible’ police presence but excitement bubbles at the chance for a night outDancing, hook-ups and bar banter will be off the menu as New Zealand’s pubs and bars reopen on Thursday night, with some saying the social distancing requirements will make for a “sad and strange” atmosphere in the nation’s party hotspots.Last week, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved the country from coronavirus lockdown level 3 to level 2, meaning most shops and restaurants could reopen, as well as schools, workplaces and public amenities.However, on advice from the Ministry of Health, bars and nightclubs remained closed for an additional week, because people’s close proximity meant they were deemed particularly high risk. One of the country’s largest outbreaks was spread at a St Patrick’s Day gathering at a Matamata pub in the North Island.On Thursday night, pubs may finally open their doors but for some, capacity will be more than halved because customers must remain seated at socially distanced tables and be waited on by a dedicated server: the social “bar” of a bar is off-limits and no one is allowed to mingle with other tables – though shouting across the room will be permitted, some bar managers said.Rogue and Vagabound in central Wellington is known for its live music and raucous dancefloor. The bar’s capacity will be reduced from 150 to 80 patrons, and live music and dancing – unless you are standing up at your own table – will not be permitted.Its general manager, Lara Denby, said she was expecting a busy night, and most of the tables had been pre-booked by regulars used to mixing and mingling.“We’re a fast-paced bar, it’s usually pint after pint after pint over the bar, so the pace will feel much slower, but it might be nice, we could get a chance to slow down and talk with our customers more,” she said.“People are really excited to be coming out, but it could be a bit sad and strange. Our customer base is very connected with each other, but it will have to be that gentle reminder, that you can’t do that in ‘the new normal’. Just stand in place at your table and have a dance on your own if you want … so strange.”Down in Dunedin the capacity at the Craic bar in the Octagon has been slashed from 100 to a maximum of 40 people. A popular spot for dancing, manager Bruce Hoffman said he was expecting a quiet night with such reduced capacity and his staff would be policing the toilets in addition to the bar for any unauthorised mingling.“It’s going to really change the atmosphere, we usually have live music and we can’t have that now because it would encourage people to dance and get too close,” Hoffman said.“I think the vibe will be quiet, more like a lounge bar. I think people are quite desperate to get out for a beer again, it gets boring at home. But you can’t mingle with any other tables, though I guess we’ll allow people to talk to other tables from afar.”With the new enforcements in place, many smaller, cocktail-style bars have said it was not economical to open their doors during level 2, and venues usually patronised exclusively for dancing such as clubs have also said they intend to stay closed until level 1, as a nightclub with no mingling allowed would defeat the purpose.A police spokesperson said they were aware people were excited about bars reopening and that officers would be maintaining a “visible presence” in party hotspots.“We understand people are keen to socialise and visit their favourite establishments, however, restrictions remain in place and safety is the number one priority,” the spokesperson said. “Officers will maintain a visible presence in our communities and continue with reassurance patrols around licensed premises”“Most New Zealanders are doing the right thing and acting responsibly. Let’s keep it up so we don’t risk the gains we’ve made to date.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22b7dc8e4e457508571039b0b0f96b60c2652e66/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=162c2b7a82e1f4fa8df7ff170e0c66ff","title":"did the uk government prepare for the wrong kind of pandemic","story":"Britain’s highly rated disease preparation failed on coronavirus – possibly because ministers followed a plan for fluWhen the coronavirus struck, the British government repeatedly said it was among the best-prepared countries in the world – with some justification. As recently as October, an international review of pandemic planning ranked the UK the second best prepared country in the world (behind the US). Two months on, any breezy confidence has evaporated. The government is facing growing complaints over a series of policy missteps that critics say are responsible for the worst death toll in Europe. How did a country that supposedly had one of the best pandemic plans in the world end up suffering one of the worst outbreaks? A review of official documents and interviews with politicians, national security advisers and experts in risk management suggests one answer may be that ministers stuck closely to the recommendations of a well-honed plan for a different disease: the flu.The origin of the UK’s strategy for a catastrophic influenza pandemic was a tractor blockade at a Cheshire oil refinery in September 2000. Several dozen farmers, angry about the cost of fuel, blockaded the Stanlow oil refinery and refused to leave until the Labour government agreed to a reduction in duty.The blockade began on a Friday. By Wednesday, the UK was on the brink of collapse. Copycat groups obstructed other fuel depots. Enormous tailbacks of panic-buying motorists stretched out of petrol stations and down motorways. Fire engines and ambulances were days away from running dry, and NHS trusts faced cancelling elective surgeries. One supermarket started rationing.The protests ended and ministers later agreed to freeze fuel duty. But according to politicians and civil servants in government at that time, the shock of the fuel crisis sparked a realisation at the highest levels of Whitehall that civil emergencies could bring down a country.“For a few days, a few hundred protesting people outside fuel depots brought the country to a halt,” said Sir Peter Ricketts, a diplomat and later David Cameron’s national security adviser. “The shock of suddenly finding the country stopped because of a few fuel depots being blockaded was a real wake-up call.”Within just the following year, the UK suffered more fuel protests, floods, foot-and-mouth disease, and the aftermath of September 11. Tony Blair’s government decided a completely new approach to civil emergencies was required, and established a revised and expanded civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, backed by new legislation.The ambition was “to create something which was better suited to the way in which the UK is run”, said Bruce Mann, the director of the unit from 2004 to 2010. Civil contingency planning would cascade downwards through tiers of government, he said, all the way from Whitehall to networks of local emergency response groups.Mann’s unit dealt with a “relentless” series of civil emergencies during his six years in charge, including periodic outbreaks of infectious disease, endless fuel supply crises including the explosion at the Buncefield fuel refinery, bird flu scares, and the aftermath of terrorist atrocities both domestic and overseas, including the 7 July 2005 bombings.But the team also had a second responsibility: predicting entirely new risks and anticipating how the government might respond. Within its first year the unit drew up the national risk register, a comprehensive catalogue of all the civil emergencies that could conceivably strike the UK, which continues to be updated annually. At the top of the list – then and now – was an influenza pandemic.Early versions of the register now read as eerily prescient. “In addition to the severe health effects, a pandemic is also likely to cause significant wider social and economic damage and disruption,” stated the 2008 register. “Normal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, shortages and distribution difficulties.” Deaths would range from 50,000 to 750,000.“Pandemic influenza has been one of the top risks in the risk register for a long time,” said Miles Elsden, a mathematician and former government scientist who specialises in contingency planning. Elsden helped coordinate meetings of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. “Everybody had been expecting something to come along,” he said. “The reasonable worst-case scenario that was the basis for most of the planning was Spanish influenza,” he added, referring to the 1918 flu pandemic that killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide.Prof Lindsey Davies, a public health doctor, was brought in as the UK’s first national director of pandemic influenza preparedness in 2006. Having been handed the “fairly skeletal” existing plan, Davies began battling for additional resources. To get them, she would need to force ministers to realise the potential scale of a pandemic crisis. Together with Mann she coordinated the first major nationwide simulation of a flu pandemic in 2007, codenamed Winter Willow.One question surrounding the government’s handling of the coronavirus is whether it implemented recommendations from a second, 2016 flu pandemic simulation, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. The report, which was leaked to the , made several recommendations that appear to have been overlooked.But Winter Willow was the far larger exercise. Where Cygnus involved 950 people, Winter Willow marshalled more than 5,000 people, including government ministers, civil servants, emergency planners, NHS staff, and emergency services personnel to coordinate the first real attempt to test how the UK would hold up under the strain of a pandemic.As well as pinpointing holes in the planning, Winter Willow galvanised ministers into taking the threat of a pandemic seriously. “Ministers, when they were faced with the reality of it, suddenly realised that this actually could be disastrous,” Davies added.But a second consensus has also emerged: that one of the UK’s big mistakes, rather than failing to plan, was planning for the wrong illness.Whole tracts of the UK’s comprehensive pandemic strategy turn upon any pandemic being flu – a different type of disease to a coronavirus. The emergency pandemic stockpile contains millions of doses of Tamiflu and Relenza to help alleviate the worst of the symptoms for anyone catching the new flu disease, and a National Flu Pandemic Service would distribute them. Stockpiles of existing flu vaccines that might be effective against the new strain would be distributed to inoculate health workers, while contingency contracts with pharmaceutical companies would be spun up to manufacture more flu drugs.The government’s most recent national security risk assessment, compiled last year, predicted a potential catastrophe in the event of a flu pandemic: trillions of pounds in damages, deaths in the five figures, disruption lasting for months. However, the risk assessment’s prediction for the potential impact of a new disease like a coronavirus was staggeringly off target. The worst-case scenario for a novel infectious disease in the UK, the government’s risk assessment said, “could be on the scale of the Sars outbreak in Toronto, Canada”, which involved 438 probable and suspected cases and 44 deaths. Economic damage would be limited to a few billion pounds, mostly from nervous tourists staying away.The British government’s focus on flu, and the failure to look at how Asian countries were responding to the coronavirus, was recently described by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt as “one of the biggest failures of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetimes”. “It is now clear that a major blind spot in the approach taken in Europe and America was our focus on pandemic flu rather than pandemic coronaviruses, such as Sars or Mers,” he told parliament.The extent to which Boris Johnson’s government stuck to a protocol laid out in its flu pandemic plans is made clear by reviewing the 2011 strategy for responding to a flu pandemic (the most recent published version available). It reads like an extraordinarily precise description of the steps the UK government did (and did not) take in its initial response to Covid-19.Mass gatherings such as football matches and live music events would continue, in part to “help maintain public morale”. There would be no quarantining of international arrivals at airports, though passengers would be encouraged to report any symptoms upon arrival. Face masks would not be recommended for use by the public. There is no mention whatsoever of healthy people being confined to their homes in an attempt to prevent transmission.Perhaps most striking is that the decision to wind down contact tracing on 12 March, widely viewed as an error that has hamstrung the UK’s ability to fight back against the coronavirus, is also alluded to in the government’s flu pandemic strategy.Its first “detection and assessment” phase ( seemingly an analogue for the “contain” phase of the coronavirus response) describes how the focus would shift away from “actively finding” and isolating confirmed and suspected cases, and instead turn to treatment of the disease once there was “evidence of sustained community transmission of the virus”. It even anticipates that detection and assessment could itself be a “relatively short” phase, depending on the circumstances.The flu strategy bluntly concludes: “It will not be possible to halt the spread of a new pandemic influenza virus, and it would be a waste of public health resources and capacity to attempt to do so.”There is one obvious but important reason why the UK may have focused its attention so much on planning for influenza: following Spanish flu in 1918, subsequent pandemics included Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1967, and swine flu in 2009. Barring HIVAids, almost every significant disease outbreak for the past hundred years has been some form of flu.A Department of Health spokesperson acknowledged that several steps taken by the government resemble those set out in the strategy, but cautioned against interpreting this as the result of some blinkered focus on the document. While useful, they stressed, the strategy would have been only one of several elements considered by government scientific advisers, alongside emerging data from Wuhan as well as new research into the nature of the virus.They added that contact tracing did not stop when Britain moved to the delay phase, but was instead focused on specific settings at risk of infection such as residential care homes. “This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice,” they said.Prof David Tuckett, an expert in decision-making under uncertainty who runs a research group called CRUISSE at University College London exploring how organisations can respond to “radical uncertainty”, has some sympathy for ministers. It would be natural for ministers to turn to their flu pandemic plan, he said, because it was the only one they had – but that can be precisely the peril of placing assumptions into the core of your plan.“You have a model based on your central case, and you have a whole set of useful things you’ve learned from some exercise or other,” Tuckett said. But if the crisis being dealt with is substantially different from the one a government has planned for “then a central case will distract you from thinking. That is, in a way, what happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d674a901dcccd9e23b837e7b1e2c69b0b1de8e0b/0_185_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768429bab06eeda7bae2e20b593ed835","title":"fewer young adults sticking uk lockdown rules study coronavirus","story":"More than half of young adults are no longer sticking strictly to UK lockdown rules, according to a survey.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..The lead author of the study, Dr Daisy Fancourt at the UCL’s epidemiology and healthcare unit, noted there had been “generally a very high” level of compliance.The findings come alongside a decrease in confidence in the government in England since the easing of lockdown was announced on 10 May.Fancourt said: “Confidence in government … is lowest in those under the age of 30.”Those questioned were asked to grade the government’s handling of the pandemic from one to a top mark of seven. Their rating had dropped from five at the beginning of lockdown to about four, according to those who were questioned between 11 and 17 May.Levels of anxiety and depression had not improved since the easing of lockdown, while worries about getting ill from Covid-19 had fallen slightly.Fears about food, finance and unemployment were a cause of stress for some people. The researchers found that about one in 12 were worried about unemployment, while about one in eight were anxious about their finances.Stress about being able to get enough food had stabilised in the past week, with fewer than one in 20 people saying they were worried about this.The Nuffield Foundation is funding the study, which is backed by Wellcome and UK Research and Innovation.Cheryl Lloyd, the head of the education programme at the foundation, said: “Interestingly, while life satisfaction levels have remained stable, full compliance with lockdown restrictions has fallen over the past week, especially among those under 30.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90bba89958ba34f17376dd30c44e8413faa09044/0_248_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=96639e42afaa43704a50922e8983cf16","title":"suriname election coronavirus president desi bouterse","story":"Coronavirus has stalled opposition’s momentum against president who was recently found guilty of mass murder as country heads into an electionWith the economy in tatters, corruption scandals piling up – and a recent mass murder conviction to add to his previous guilty verdicts for drug trafficking, it seemed until recently that president Desi Bouterse’s 40-year grip on power in Suriname was coming to an end.But as South America’s smallest country heads into an election on 25 May, the Covid-19 pandemic may have thrown him a lifeline.Bouterse is the great survivor of Latin American politics – and its most outrageous outlaw. After coming to power as the leader of a 1980 coup, Bouterse ruled as military dictator before adopting a behind-the-scenes role in the 1990s and 2000s.He was elected president in 2010, proving uniquely able to win support across the many ethnic groups that make up the former Dutch colony’s population of half a million. He was re-elected at the head of his National Democratic Party (NDP) with a smaller margin in 2015.Over his last decade in office, he has tried to delay and disrupt a legal case over his role in the 1982 murder of 15 prominent opposition at Fort Zeelandia, a pink-brick fortified chateau in Paramaribo, the capital. But in December a military court found him guilty of murder.He is appealing the decision and looks unlikely to see the inside of a cell, but the verdict marked a victory for the opposition.“That the president could be convicted by an independent court is a compliment to the independence of our justice system. It shows that no one is above the law,” said Chan Santokhi, leader of the opposition Progressive Reform Party (known by its Dutch initials VHP) – and a former chief of police who led the investigation into the murders.The criminal dealings of the Bouterse family are widely known. In 1999 Dutch courts convicted Bouterse in absentia of smuggling nearly half a ton of cocaine into the country, meaning he can no longer travel to countries with extradition treaties with the Netherlands.His son, Dino, currently resides in a Mississippi prison cell, having offered Suriname as a base for Hezbollah operations to DEA agents working a sting. In 2011 Bouterse granted a pardon to his foster son, Romano Meriba, who had been convicted in 2005 of the murder of a Chinese trader and of throwing a hand grenade at the Dutch ambassador’s residence.Such scandals have not dented Bouterse’s appeal. With the no-nonsense aspect of a heavy-weight boxer and a melodious voice he deploys in man-of-the-people speeches and impressive Frank Sinatra renditions, Bouterse curates a loveable tough-guy image that has won him widespread popularity among working-class Surinamers.But if his persona reminded some of Hugo Chávez – who he considered a friend and ally until the Venezuelan president’s death in 2013 – then so, too, did his fiscal profligacy and disdain for democratic institutions. He boosted social spending and doled out public sector jobs to allies even as gold and aluminium exports – the country’s primary source of revenue – tanked.To cover the cracks, the government raised more than $1.5bn in Chinese loans, development finance and a $550m 10 year bond from Oppenheimer, a New York investment bank.“We warned the banks that the Central Bank was broke and not to be trusted – it hasn’t published a report since 2014 – but they didn’t listen, and the Central Bank used the savers’ foreign exchange to cover the government’s imports,” said Ramautarsing.Suriname’s longterm economic prospects could be brighter, however.In January international oil firms announced they had discovered offshore oil, leading to speculation that the reserves recently developed in Guyana could extend into Surinamese waters. If Bouterse can cling on to power, his next term could see billions of dollars of foreign investment.Until recently, however, that seemed unlikely. “The loss of purchasing power as a result of the weak currency has cost Bouterse a lot of middle class support, particularly in the capitol where opposition parties have grown rapidly” said Hans Breeveld, a political analyst at Anton de Kom University in Paramaribo.But the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the opposition’s momentum. To date the country has had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death, but a curfew and social distancing measures have been in place since 8 April, cutting off the sparsely populated forested inland regions from the coast.That has made it impossible for opposition groups to organize ralliesor reach inland areas. The pandemic has prompted to the EU to cancel its election observation mission, although the Organization of American States (OAS) will send a ten-person team.“In the interior you need just 700 votes for some seats, compared to 7,000 in the capital. There’s been no oversight of what’s happening in the interior and Bouterse’s party has a history of using national funds for his campaigns,” said Breeveld. Santokhi warned that a failure to oust Bouterse would have wider ramifications for the region.“Surinamers have a choice between a better future or to become the next Venezuela” he says. “Should Bouterse retain power, the Caribbean region can expect to see economic refugees and cross border crime.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258635.1590015720!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert students must opt in to receive calculated grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe new calculated grades system is being set up following the cancellation of Leaving Cert exams on public health grounds due to Covid-19. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillLeaving Cert students will not automatically receive calculated grades but will have to to opt-in for them under a new online system being set up to manage the cancellation of exams.Students will also have the opportunity to re-nominate their subject levels - such as higher, ordinary and foundation - at which they wish to receive their calculated grades, according to well-placed sources.Online training is due to be provided to teachers regarding the new\u0026nbspprocess over the coming days, along with detailed written guidance from the Department of Education.These steps are expected to be outlined in official guidance for use of calculated grades to be issued to schools and teachers on Thursday.Teachers’ unions have expressed their disappointment to the department that these arrangements are not in place yet given that the academic year is finished at the end of May.Under the terms of their contracts, however, teachers are required to be available for non-teaching work in schools beyond this point,\u0026nbspwhere necessary.Following the Government\u0027s decision earlier this month to cancel the summer Leaving Cert exams, more than 60,000 students are set to receive calculated grades for the first time based on teachers’ estimates.Under this approach, teachers will be asked to provide an estimated percentage mark for each student for each subject. Students will also be placed in a rank over for their class.The guidance will state that teachers should draw on “existing records and available evidence” such as classwork, homework, class assessments, Christmas and summer exams and mock exams. Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions.Marking systemIn order to determine where students rank inidually in a class, each student may be marked out of 1,000 and these scores will then be converted to per centages.These grades will then be sent to the Department of Education where a unit will compare information on how students in the school have fared in particular subjects in the Leaving Cert over the past three years compared to the national standard.Sources also said that teachers will be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members under official guidance to be issued shortly.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.In cases where students who are studying a subject outside a recognised school, Mr McHugh has signalled that these students will be examined on a case-by-case basis.A total of 2,858 external candidates are entered to sit the Leaving Cert this year, many of whom are studying in an alternative setting such as a private college.For students in receipt of home tuition with an association to a recognised school, the guidance will provide information for school authorities to engage with the home tutor in arriving at a decision.Whether a valid estimate of performance can be provided will depend on whether the home tutor is a registered teacher and where the school is satisfied with the evidence used to support the judgment.In cases where a student has moved school recently and the length of time is such that the teacher considers that they do not have enough evidence to make a sound judgement, the guidance will state that the teacher should consult school management about acquiring additional information from the student’s previous school."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study findsFifty brain teasers on all things natural from sealife to flora and what tofu is made of"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:  Alan BetsonThe HSE told the nursing homes regulator last month, as coronavirus outbreaks rose sharply, that it could not supply three days’ worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) to all nursing homes, as requested, due to shortages. The Health Information and Quality Authority’s chief inspector Mary Dunnion escalated concerns about reported shortages of PPE within nursing homes and congregated disability centres last month to the highest ranking official with the HSE.Ms Dunnion wrote to HSE chief executive Paul Reid on April 8th seeking widespread distribution of PPE to nursing homes ahead of further outbreaks. DeathsThe request came more than a week after Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents private nursing homes operators, sought three days’ worth of PPE for nursing homes in a meeting with the Minister for Health Simon Harris. The nursing home sector has borne the brunt of the pandemic, accounting for 54 per cent of the deaths from coronavirus in the State.By the peak of the crisis in the first half of April, nursing homes were experiencing difficulties accessing sufficient PPE. On April 8th, there were virus clusters – each defined as two cases or more – at 164 residential care facilities, including 117 nursing homes, an increase from 53 a week earlier. Ms Dunnion asked Mr Reid in her letter that “in the interest of resident and staff protection” and “prior to a Covid-19 outbreak being declared” that a “baseline supply” of appropriate PPE “be made available as a priority within all nursing homes and congregated disability centres”.“While the national supply of PPE remains a concern, I request that a baseline supply should consider the projected consumption rate relative to the number of residents in the centre and be sufficient to last three days,” she told Mr Reid in her letter. The correspondence was copied to senior health officials: HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor HSE national director of community operations David Walsh the HSE’s national director of quality assurance and verification ision, Patrick Lynch Dr Kathleen MacLellan, assistant secretary for social care at the Department of Health and Hiqa chief executive Phelim Quinn. Ms Dunnion sought PPE for nursing homes not yet affected by outbreaks comprising long-sleeved, fluid-repellent disposable gowns, non-sterile examination gloves, surgical masks and “FFP2” and “FFP3” medical grade masks for aerosol-generating procedures.The letter was released by Hiqa to The  under the Freedom of Information Act. Under reviewThe HSE told Hiqa in a response on April 14th that due to difficulties in sourcing PPE that it would not be possible to provide the three-day baseline supply. PPE was being directed at the areas of greatest risk through a co-ordinated distribution management system for the delivery of the equipment, the HSE said.In the HSE’s reply, Patrick Lynch, national director of quality assurance, told Hiqa that Ms Dunnion’s requested supply of PPE would be kept under review as the supplies of PPE built up.By April 14th, the date of the HSE’s response, the number of clusters in residential care facilities had risen to 221, including 158 nursing homes, a further 41 nursing homes in six days. A spokeswoman for the HSE said last night that in the early days of the response to Covid-19 it “faced an unprecedented challenge in the face of global demand for PPE.”The HSE’s success in sourcing significant quantities from China and domestically has meant “the supply situation has improved significantly over the past four weeks in particular,” she said.Each crisis management team across the HSE’s community healthcare area is “prioritising the needs of long-term care residents” and has “offered very significant support to the nursing homes in their areas, particularly those with Covid-19 outbreaks,” said the spokeswoman. Between April 17th and May 14th some 12.6 million items of PPE - or 39 per cent of all PPE distributed across the health service - went to the long-term residential care sector, she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258280.1589985478!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reopening of mcdonald s brings joy and traffic jams to dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Kelly Leahy and Aimee Bennett from Crumlin were among the first to secure their order when McDonald’s  reopened its drive thru  on the Kylemore Road on Wednesday. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Thirty years ago McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in the Soviet Union. Thousands turned up to the grand opening in Moscow’s Pushkinskaya Square and the crowds kept coming for weeks afterwards.For many observers at the time, it symbolised the end of the Cold War and the embrace of capitalist values in the communist East.The reopening of six McDonald’s drive-thrus in Dublin hardly represents an epoch moment in world history, but for those queuing for the return of the Big Mac it meant a glimpse of normality after months of lockdown.McDonald’s tried to keep the openings low-key, but when word got out that a few restaurants were reopening at 11am, albeit on a very limited basis, the cars started to descend on the Dublin restaurants involved - Nutgrove, East Wall, Artane, Malahide, Kylemore Road and Tallaght.Staff wore face masks and there were perspex screens at the drive thru windows - though a drive thru was a form of social distancing before the concept was created.Some might sniff that McDonald’s is a symbol of our calorific and consumerist lifestyle, but who cares when you have been cooped up at home for weeks on end?Cars that turned up early to the McDonald’s in Kylemore Road, Dublin were turned away as the car park was not open. A few parked on the verges outside. As soon as the bollards went down, the cars streamed in.Within a few minutes they were backed up on the Kylemore Road right up and around the corner to the very busy Naas Road which is one of the main approach roads into Dublin. At one stage gardaí arrived to sort out the congestion.Many queued in overheated cars for a half-an-hour for a menu that was limited by necessity as not all McDonald’s staff have returned to work yet.Most of the early-birds were mothers with their children. Deprived of the rhythms of school, the promise of a McDonald’s is no longer the mundane treat it used to be.At the front of the queue Danielle Gannon brought her children Holly (9) and Aidan (9) to get happy meals.“Everything has been taken from them. When I heard it was open, I said, ‘why not?’ They can’t go to playgrounds. It’s been tough on the kids. They weren’t missing school at the start - it was a novelty, but now they are dying to get back to normal and so am I.”Elaine Smith turned up with her daughter Kelly (20). Elaine just wanted to get the McDonald’s coffee “that’s my normal school run and I miss it” while Kelly was getting chicken nuggets and chips.Sinead Fleet and her son Scott (9) came down after a visit to Crumlin children’s hospital where he was getting a procedure done. Her son, who has Down Syndrome, beamed as he clutched the familiar brown bag with its yellow arches.“He heard about the chips. It’s his favourite things. It’s great to have some bit of normality back for him. That’s the first bit of normality for him. It’s been very tough without any services or schooling,” she said.McDonald’s intends to open the rest of its drive thrus in Ireland in early June."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258591.1590004458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are there so many coronavirus infections at meat plants","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmployees at meat plants work in prolonged close proximity to other workers, increasing the risk of transmitting the virus. Photograph: BloombergWhat is the scale of infection in meat processing plants?There are 16 coronavirus clusters – each defined as two or more cases – in meat plants involving 828 infected workers, as of last Saturday. This is an increase from 500 a week earlier when there were 12 clusters. Some 16 meat factory workers have been hospitalised during the pandemic. HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry put the number of infected workers at 860 on Wednesday.Why are meat plants susceptible to outbreaks?Employees at meat plants work in prolonged close proximity to other workers, increasing the risk of transmitting the virus. The rigid production lines, often involving for example in a conveyor belt of pig carcasses on hooks passing along a factory’s “kill line”, means that the nature of the work is at close quarters involving repeated activity by hundreds of staff standing shoulder to shoulder. As an essential industry producing food, meat plants were not closed during the pandemic.How busy can it be in a meat plant?Butchering, when not automated, is a fast and heavily labour-intensive process. For example, the processing of as many as 450 pigs per hour – or seven pigs processed along the line every minute – means that each worker often only has a few seconds to complete their task of cutting on each animal.Can the process contribute to the spread of the virus?Possibly. The gruelling nature and pace of the meat processing, cutting up so many animals in a short space of time, means butchering can involve strenuous physical exertion and heavy breathing by employees. The boning hall of a plant can also involve large numbers of workers congregating around a common table in another physically demanding part of the process.What other conditions might lead to the spread of the virus?Conditions in plants can be hot with workers butchering warm carcasses with knives that must be repeatedly sterilised at high temperatures. This can create a steamy atmosphere. Some plants can be poorly ventilated, contributing to the spread, while physically distancing may not have been observed in worker common areas such as at sinks or in canteens and changing rooms.Could other factors contribute to the spread at meat plants?Yes. Many meat plants employ lower-paid foreign workers who share accommodation outside of work, where they could have acquired the virus and can spread it further. Public health officials has been offering alternative accommodation to workers at risk of passing the virus on.What precautions have plants taken to prevent the spread of the virus?Plants have reduced production by processing fewer animals, staggered working shifts and staff departures and arrivals, and reconfigured production lines including installing partitions, where possible, to ensure workers maintain two-metre physical distancing.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister says massive logistical work required to reopen schools in SeptemberTest can detect if person has had Covid-19 and can determine prevalence in populationSignificant increase in number of complaints received by office of An Coimisin\u0026eacuteir TeangaCandidates will have the option to re-nominate subject levels through online systemGroup of multinationals in Ireland has worked with academics in the pharma sectorHiqa chief inspector sought \u0026lsquopriority\u0026rsquo supply for homes from HSE chief on April 8thCatholic Church teachings will have \u0026lsquono authority \u0026rsquo at Elm Park, says canon lawyerOver a third of recipients were paid less than \u0026euro300 a week before payment was introducedHSE working on new plan for when it will be safe to resume routine screeningWatchdog report criticises University of Limerick and South Southwest hospital groupsWatchdog warns Limerick and South Southwest groups face \u0026lsquosignificant\u0026rsquo risksThe way we live now helps infectious diseases spill over from wild animals to humansGovernment sources privately fear the North set to become Brexit battleground againStrong backing for more ambition to address carbon emissions, according to pollDublin, Louth, Limerick, Clare and Galway properties most vulnerable, analysis findsChildren had to come to live with their father in Kildare after their mother died in the PhilippinesTwo metre social distancing rule may prevent hotels reopening, says taskforce memberGusts of up to 110kmh expected in Galway and Mayo on Thursday and FridayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258599.1590005207!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kerry county council responsible for serious breach of gaeltacht planning law","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The council failed to implement a linguistic provision which was attached to An Bord Pleanála’s planning permission for a housing development, an inquiry found. Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyKerry County Council was responsible for a “serious breach” of planning law when it failed to implement a language condition designed to protect the linguistic and cultural heritage of Gaeltacht areas, an Coimisinéir Teanga Rónán Ó Domhnaill has said.Details of an investigation carried out by the Coimisinéir are outlined in his office’s annual report for 2019, which was published today.The investigation found that the council failed to implement a linguistic provision which was attached to An Bord Pleanála’s planning permission for a housing development in Baile an Fheirtéaraigh in the Corca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht in 2004.The condition meant that the owners or long-term tenants of 75 per cent of houses built in a development called Na Cluainte in Baile an Fheirtéaraigh would be required to demonstrate their fluency in the Irish language.Following a complaint by a member of the public that this condition had not been met, Mr Ó Domhnaill initiated an investigation.While the language condition was included in an agreement between the council and the developer, the investigation found that “there were fundamental faults in this agreement that rendered it not fit for purpose”.InvestigationThe investigation revealed that the construction commenced before an agreement was made with the developer about the language agreement, the provisions of the agreement were not appropriate to achieve its objective, and the actions taken to implement the agreement “demonstrated a lack of clarity, procrastination and a lack of commitment”.“It was also clear that no long-term occupier was ever interviewed to determine their ability in Irish nor was any purchaser of any of the houses that had an Irish language requirement attached to it ever contacted for the purpose of ensuring that this requirement was fulfilled.”It was recommended that the council inform the Coimisinéir’s office for the next five years of any planning permission granted in the Kerry Gaeltacht for large planning applications or applications in respect of three dwellings or more.This was the first time an investigation was carried out relating to the application of a language provision of the Planning and Development Act 2000.Mr Ó Domhnaill said the investigation was “important” due to the impact an increase in non-Irish speakers could have on “the future of Irish as a community language in the Gaeltacht”.The Coimisinéir Teanga, whose role includes ensuring compliance by public bodies with statutory obligations under language legislation, warned of the dangers faced by Gaeltacht areas if laws that are meant to protect the Irish language are not implemented.“There is a language crisis in the Gaeltacht as is and if the law to protect the Irish language in the Gaeltacht isn’t adhered to then it is clear the situation will deteriorate,” he said.Complaints“Not only is it the first time a language provision of that Act has been investigated, it also highlights a serious breach of the planning law by Kerry County Council . . . a breach of a law that is there to protect the use of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht,” he said.An 11 per cent increase was recorded in the number of complaints received by the Coimsinéir Teanga’s office last year. This represented a “substantial increase” on the number of complaints made to the office in 2018, Mr Ó Domhnaill said.A total of 704 complaints were made to the office about difficulties accessing services through Irish in 2019. Eighteen per cent of complaints came from Gaeltacht areas while 35.3 per cent came from the Dublin region.The Coimisinéir Teanga attributed the increase to the continued difficulties citizens experience accessing public services through Irish.“These difficulties occur as a result of insufficient personnel in the public service with competence in the Irish language and due to legislation that isn’t comprehensive enough.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259068.1590049411!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary schools unlikely to reopen in june and union sees mammoth task in september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe National Public Health Emergency Team has said it does not see schools returning before September.  File photograph: Dave ThompsonPA Wire.It is unlikely that primary schools will reopen in June, the general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) John Boyle has said.Getting children back to school in September will be a “mammoth planning task” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. With 20 school days to go before the summer break it would be very difficult for schools to reopen, even on a phased basis. Mr Boyle warned that it may not be possible for all children to return at the same time in September as there will be logistical issues particularly in rural Ireland where many children travel to school by bus.Ireland has the largest school classes in Europe so it would not be possible for all pupils to return at the same time, he added. There will also have to be changes on school campuses which parents will not be able to access in the same way they did previously.If the Leaving Cert could not go ahead, Mr Boyle said he could not see how it would be possible for groups of younger children to return to school. Children with complex educational needs will be provided for through summer programmes.The INTO has been engaging with stakeholders to prepare for the return of children to school, and to see if it would be possible for all children to return at the same time. The teachers’ union is “certainly up for that challenge,” he added.His comments come after the National Public Health Emergency Team said on Wednesday that it does not see schools returning before September. Asked about calls for the reopening of schools to be considered, deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn told the press briefing that Ireland’s peak in cases occurred “quite a bit later” than in many other countries, some of which were now reopening schools or crèches.This delay gave us the opportunity to get ready for a surge in cases and now that the curve was on the way back down, it afforded Ireland the opportunity to learn from other countries’ experience.He added: “As things currently stand, we don’t envisage schools coming back before September.”The deaths of another 11 patients with Covid-19 were reported by NPHET on Wednesday. There have now been a total of 1,571 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic.A total of 64 new laboratory confirmed cases of the disease was reported by NPHET at its daily briefing, bringing the total number of cases to 24,315. This is the fifth day in a row in which the daily case number has remained below 100.Meanwhile, Minister for Education Joe McHugh said massive logistical work is required in order to reopen schools in time for September.Mr McHugh said it was clear that a “one size fits all” approach will not apply because of the ersity of school and education settings.Áine Lynch, chief executive of the National Parents’ Council Primary, said a decision to keep schools closed until September was made at a time when public health conditions were worse than they are now.The World Health Organisation (WHO) special envoy on Covid-19 also said it is was time to think about reopening schools in Ireland.Mr McHugh, however, said opening schools needs to be “carefully managed” and planning is under way for the reopening of educational institutions from the beginning of September, in consultation with stakeholders and with regard to the experience of other countries.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258611.1590006310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there is no social distancing reopening of forty foot gets off to rocky start","story":"Sunbathers and swimmers enjoy the sun, the sea and the fresh air at the Forty Foot and Sandycove, Dublin, on Wednesday afternoon.  Popular amenities are, however, still subject to strict social distancing guidelines.

Photograph: Alan BetsonFor a couple of shimmering, sun-kissed minutes at lunchtime on a warm May day in Sandycove it seemed almost as if everything was okay again. Children in swimsuits played by the water’s edge, oblivious to the cold as parents decanted picnics onto rugs and bellowed at their offspring to mind themselves.Then an older couple emerged together from the freezing, snot green sea and before they so much as draped a towel around their goose pimpled bodies, they had put their surgical face masks on.This was no normal day at the beach and the couple coming out of the water were acutely aware of it.“There is no social distancing being observed at all, I can tell you that,” said Robert McQuillan. He described himself as a year-round swimmer and since the lockdown he and his wife Jane have been swimming closer to their Killiney home.BlameBut because the sea there was rough on this day, and because Sandycove had just re-opened to the public, they decided to venture a little farther afield.As he spoke Mrs McQuillan nodded in agreement.“It is more kids than anything, they are running all over the place. People are supposed to be coming here to swim before leaving. They’re not though. You can’t blame the children, they are just doing what comes naturally. But as an adult you would want to be deaf, dumb and blind not to know the rules at this stage.”A man who identified himself only as David stood at the water’s edge and prepared to e in to the water. “I was here yesterday evening and decided to come back again today,” he said.He declined to give his full name because, he said, he lived farther than 5km from the beach he was standing on. His home was 14km away, in fact. He called out to his girlfriend, instead, to see if she would talk to The .“I can’t be identified either,” she said. “My boss thinks I am at work.” Then they jumped into the sea together.‘Cooped up’Nearby three people sat side by side, separated by the required two metres – or close enough to it.“I swim every day,” Martin Archbold said. “But it looks a bit overcrowded and my concern is that that this is a trial and if the crowds come they will simply close the place again. People are supposed to be here to swim and they go.”His swimming buddy Michael Forde nodded. “I haven’t even got in yet. It is too packed here, it is crazy, this is not what it should be. Mind you, you can understand why people want to be here because they have all been cooped up at home for weeks.” Then he went off for a walk having decided to give the swim a skip for now.Around the corner from the small stretch of sand, is the Forty Foot. Signs billowing in the wind on the approach reminded people of the need to socially distance and to “swim and go”. The 40 or so teenagers sitting around clearly didn’t see the signs or if they did, they had taken the decision to ignore them. They weren’t too gone on social distancing either.They sat huddled together in distinct tribes. Some were drinking cans of lager, others were listening to Michael Jackson on a boombox, partying like it was 1979.Maria Quintilla, another hardy swimmer, looked at the large group with disapproval in her eyes. “I am actually afraid of the sea,” she said. “But it is important to fight your fears. It helps you build confidence and the sea water is really good for the immune system.”While she was concerned about the influx of young people, she was more relaxed about the families gathered nearby. “I think people have been very respectful and keeping their distance.”She started a conversation with a group of fellow swimmers.“I have called the guards,” one said. Then they all looked out over the water towards Dollymount across the bay.Back at the entrance to the Forty Foot, a man in loud shorts emblazoned with a popular cola brand swigged deeply from a glass bottle of cider and sauntered over to where his friends were relaxing in the sun.Minutes later two squad cars arrived at the scene. Two gardaí climbed out of one and strolled along the little beach asking people where they lived and reminding them of the need to move on. The other gardaí approached the group of younger people at the Forty Foot changing area and asked where they were from. “Blackrock, ” said a boy from Clondalkin.If the gardaí didn’t believe him they didn’t let on. It was all pretty relaxed and within minutes the groups in both sections had largely dispersed leaving it to the swimmers and the seals. The wind was picking up by then anyway.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258512.1590001175!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish climate change policies should turn on science not politics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFriends of the Earth said the poll results indicate a desire for ‘faster and fairer climate action at the heart of everything a new government does’. File photograph: GettyA poll on the extent of public support for climate action that might be undertaken under a new programme for government indicates strong backing for increased ambition in addressing carbon emissions.Despite difficult economic times ahead, almost two-thirds of adults in Ireland believe it remains important that the incoming government prioritises climate change.The poll of 1,021 adults was conducted by Opinions Market Research between May 12th to May 18th for the environmental group Friends of the Earth.Some 90 per cent of respondents believe Irish climate-change policies should be guided by science rather than politics – as was the case with Covid-19.There is large support (92 per cent) for government initiatives to support jobs by encouraging the improvement of a home’s energy efficiency.Some three out of four citizens believe investment in transport should favour safe walking, cycling and public transport ahead of private vehicles this support is at 80 per cent in Dublin and at 72 per cent in rural Ireland.Almost three in four people polled agreed carbon emission reductions should be pursued to ensure more sustainability in farming. Support for this action was reflected across all regions. In Dublin, the figure was 79 per cent for in the rest of Leinster it was 72 per cent in Munster 70 per cent and Connacht-Ulster 68 per cent.What was the extent of opposition?Friends of the Earth director Oisín Coghlan said he believed the scale of public support for serious climate action indicated in the poll was overwhelming.“We hope the results will give all three parties negotiating a programme for government the confidence to put faster and fairer climate action at the heart of everything a new government does,” he said.“We simply can’t afford to waste another five years dabbling at the edges of climate action. This poll shows that across all parts of Irish society, regardless of age, gender, class or urbanrural, there is a large majority in favour of stronger action to reduce pollution from transport, buildings and farming,” he added.Seven in 10 Irish citizens feel “very strongly” that a failure to act on climate change is a failure to act in the best interests of the people of Ireland. This view is held most strongly among those aged under 35, with 76 per cent agreement within that cohort. Only 23 per cent of respondents either “disagree strongly” or “disagree somewhat”.Full details of the poll are available here."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258625.1590008067!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 200 000 earning more on covid 19 unemployment payment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Paschal Donohoe:  warned that the Government would face demands to increase regular job seekers’ benefits up to the level of the weekly Covid-19 unemployment payments. Photograph:  Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireA significant minority of people in receipt of the €350 pandemic unemployment payment were paid less than €300 a week before the payment was introduced, a Government report has said, as questions continue about the future of the payment.The report, compiled by the Department of Business, raises concerns about “significant disincentive effects associated with the pandemic unemployment payment with 38 per cent of recipients previously earning less than €300 per week”.With almost 600,000 people receiving the special payment, it means that over 200,000 people are better off unemployed than they were while working. That number includes many people who were working part-time in the hospitality industry.Although there are growing worries in Government about the sustainability of the payment, Ministers are likely to extend the special payment over summer, declining to either signal a firm end date or to close the scheme, according to sources familiar with the discussions on the topic.Yesterday, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned that the Government would face demands to increase regular job seekers’ benefits up to the level of the weekly Covid-19 unemployment payments if these were to be maintained at the current rates until the end of the year.At present people who were unemployed prior to the current coronavirus crisis receive jobseekers’ benefit of €203 per week. However those who lost their jobs on foot of Covid-19 receive a special pandemic unemployment payment of €350 per week.There is a general belief among Ministers that the €350 a week payment cannot continue indefinitely. But there is no consensus on how to bring it to an end.Yesterday, Mr Donohoe said if the Government was to continue paying the special Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment at the current levels until the end of the year as had been suggested, it would then face “an understandable issue” in which citizens who were unemployed prior to the current crisis would ask why their jobseeker benefits were so much lower.Mr Donohoe’s forecast of demands for unemployment benefit equality came as the Government faced calls to extend the separate special weekly € 350 payment for those with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection to cancer patients who were cocooning.The Irish Cancer Society said on Wednesday cocooning cancer patients “must have fair access to pandemic illness payments so they do not feel forced to risk an unsafe return to work”.The group said it was unfair that cancer patients who were unable to return to work because they are cocooning could not access the payment.Everything

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

Bradford voted 54.2 per cent to leave the EU and the others voted at least 60 per cent in favour.The move comes two months after the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the BBC had failed to understand the strength of pro-Brexit feeling and had provided a “narrow urban outlook” in its news reporting.John Humphrys, the former presenter of Radio 4’s Today programme, has said the referendum result took the BBC by surprise because the corporation was so out of touch with ordinary people.The plan states: “We need to build around a definition of ‘local’ determined by audience need and by a focus on an audience that is less well served by the BBC’s current network portfolio.“This is likely to involve a greater emphasis on serving audiences in the Midlands and North of England better, including focusing on areas the BBC has traditionally served less well, such as Bradford, Sunderland, Wolverhampton, Blackpool and Peterborough.”The change of approach is part of wider changes in the BBC’s local news services in England, which are to undergo a “profound transformation” amid budget cuts.“Our current local strategy in England was effectively created in the 1960s and 1970s when local radio and regional TV transmitters set the pattern for how the BBC thinks about local and regional audiences and editorial output. But while little has changed in the BBC’s editorial offer or geographical targeting, audiences have changed,” it said.Elsewhere in the plan, it was confirmed that BBC Four is to be downgraded to a repeats channel, with original arts programming and documentaries being squeezed into BBC Two.BBC Four could also become the first BBC channel available to foreign audiences, with plans under way to turn it into a subscription channel outside the UK as the corporation looks for new ways to generate commercial income.BBC Four is to become a repeats channel which viewers outside the UK can pay to access, as the corporation looks for new ways to generate commercial income.It will be the first BBC channel available to foreign audiences, showcasing programmes from the archives.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris cant afford surrender contemptible teaching unions","story":"What is going on? Are the hard-Left education unions actually going to manage to delay the partial reopening of our primary schools? Is the great Vote Leave Government, until now an astonishingly successful establishment-slaying machine, about to suffer its first defeat? Are the Michael GoveDominic Cummings schools reforms of the 2010s about to be avenged by a tiny rump of unrepresentative activists convinced that they are refighting the Miners’ Strikes of the 1980s?Let us hope that it is a clever bluff from the Government, a case of “appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak,” as Sun Tzu put it in the Art of War. Boris Johnson can’t afford the unions to defy him. Schools must start reopening on June 1, and the small gang of selfish activists seeking to derail this must be crushed pitilessly.This is not an attack on teachers. With the infection rate collapsing, most are keen to return to some sort of normality, as are heads and governors. They miss the children in their care and have done their best to continue to teach them remotely in the chaos of the past few months. They deserve our utmost gratitude. We should ensure that the return to the classroom takes place as safely as possible.But I strongly object to elitist union leaders who are seeking to sabotage, through undemocratic means, the extraordinarily careful, limited reopening planned by the Government. Theirs is a contemptible ideological act, an offensive, snobbish snub to the millions of workers who have already returned, without complaint, to hospitals, factories, shops, logistics operations and offices.The prolonged closure of our schools – a move I supported, perhaps mistakenly, at the start of this crisis, when the scale of the pandemic, the forms of social interaction most likely to spread it, and the groups most at risk from the virus were all unclear – is fast turning into an educational, social and economic calamity. Millions of children are not being educated at all, others barely so by the end of the summer, they could have fallen 12 months behind, forgetting everything they learnt earlier this year.Others are missing the sport, the clubs and friendships. Some are depressed many poorer children are going to bed hungry abuse cases have shot up. The consequences in terms of social mobility, knowledge, productivity, mental health and crime will plague us for years.The gains in achievement eked out by the GoveCummings reforms in the state school sector, and the return to greater rigour over the past 15 years, could be wiped away. We will tumble down the international Pisa league tables, especially if our schools end up shut for longer than those of our European neighbours. The gap between poor and rich is growing again the private schools, to their credit, are doing far better than the state sector, with some even delivering full, real-time online lessons.The indirect impact is equally cataclysmic. Parents of younger children cannot work at all, Zoom or no Zoom. Millions of others are house-bound: they cannot travel to shops or factories or hospitals or warehouses. Our economy depends on childcare and schooling for parents to be able to operate, especially with grandparents in confinement. The costs in terms of unemployment will be horrific. Hundreds of thousands of lives will be ruined.The real critique of the Government’s plans is that they are too modest, given the dramatic decline in new infections, especially outside care homes: Labour should be arguing that schools should be reopening faster. Why isn’t Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, pointing out that his R-rate has collapsed to almost zero, demanding that all schools in the capital be released from lockdown to allow the city he supposedly cares about to start to recover? Instead, the Left, once again, has allied itself with the barons against the people.It is not as if reopening schools is somehow eccentric. Europe is leading the way, with adaptations for social distancing, without a surge in new infections. It is now clear that almost no children have died from the virus, that they usually suffer far less than adults when they do get it, and that they are unlikely to pass it to adults. Yes, a small number of youngsters have suffered some rare symptoms – but why do the British trade unions believe that what is good for French, German, Danish and Swedish children is too dangerous for British ones?It’s time for the Government to return to its Vote Leave ways, and launch a proper fightback. This is no longer a “national”, “wartime” Government with mass support that therefore needs to tread in a bipartisan way: politics is fast renormalising. Brexit and Tory voters agree with the Government, Labour supporters and Remainers don’t. Sir Keir Starmer is on the warpath.Johnson must consider urgent legislation to force all state schools to reopen, drafted in such a way as to prevent any informal boycotts. The growing number of councils that are refusing to comply should lose control of their schools, with all of them turned into academies. This may be the time to wipe away the Local Education Authority model in its entirety. Schools should also be mandated to keep online lessons going for those year groups still at home. The timing of the summer holidays should be reviewed: the school year must either be extended, or the autumn term should start earlier. Every state school should publish a 12-month plan detailing how they will ensure that children catch up.This crackdown should go hand in hand with leniency in other ways. Parents who are too worried to send their children to school should be allowed to keep them at home until the start of the next academic year. Teachers in vulnerable groups should not be forced to work. The authorities should do everything in their power to minimise risk and pay for plentiful PPE.But our democratically elected Government has the right to reopen state schools, and the unions no right to obstruct it. Johnson cannot allow himself to be cowed into extending the lockdown yet further. He should show some Thatcherite ankle, and call the far-Left’s bluff.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"culture secretary rules regional variation easing lockdown covid","story":"The Culture Secretary has hailed ‘promising’ figures showing only small numbers of people are now testing positive for coronavirus in London.Oliver Dowden said the Government may consider lifting restrictions in ‘micro-hotspots’ when track and trace was in place but ruled out regional variation, saying the intention was to still ‘move as a whole nation’. It comes amid growing unease that economically damaging restrictions are still in place in areas where the virus is virtually eliminated. Last week The  revealed how Public Health England (PHE) modelling suggested fewer than 24 people a day were being infected in London, with the number halving every 3.5 days.New analysis by Oxford University for The  shows that six major London hospital trusts have reported no deaths in the past 48 hours.Homerton, University College London, Hillingdon, North Middlesex, Whittington Health,  and Guy’s and St Thomas\u0027, were recording up to 16 deaths a day at the peak of the crisis, and have totalled more than 1,000 deaths since the start of the epidemic between them.New testing data released this week from PHE also appeared to show that nobody tested positive on Tuesday, although the figures have since been revised to just 14 cases. Mr Dowden agreed that the numbers were ‘promising’ and ‘moving in the right direction.’But when asked by ITV at the daily press briefing whether lockdown could be eased regionally based on the PHE data, he ruled out the idea.“We have to be highly cautious about it,” Mr Dowden said. “The Prime Minister set out the path that we will go down in terms of easing lockdown. The next stage... we said from the earliest will be from the beginning of June.“We want to proceed as fast and as we safely can because clearly there are benefits for children and clearly benefits for the wider economy.“I think it is best though, and the Government has said this repeatedly, that we move as a whole nation and that would include of course the whole of England in doing so.”There is increasing concern among some ministers - including the Chancellor - and many Tory MPs about the potential for long-term damage to the economy because of the number of people still off work.The Treasury estimates the coronavirus crisis will cost the economy almost £300 billion this year, and figures released this week showed that 10 million private sector workers are now relying on Government furlough schemes.Getting the capital back to work is key to minimising what Rishi Sunak describes as scarring of the economy, as London generates almost a quarter of the nation\u0027s gross domestic product. The south east as a whole, including London, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of GDP.The new Oxford analysis by Professor Carl Heneghan and Dr Jason Oke, at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine,  shows that there 41 of the 131 acute NHS trusts have not reported a single death from coronavirus in the past 48 hours.The same trusts recorded 320 deaths between them in the same timeframe around the peak of the crisis on April 7-8.Some 40 per cent of all trusts, including the non-acute, have recorded no deaths for the past seven days, including 10 major acute trusts, mainly in the south west.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said it was ‘time to unlock.’“We must get on with it.” he said. “London is a significant chunk of the capability of the UK and this is on the decline everywhere. If we behave as the Government has been saying, not so much social distancing, but continuing with the hygiene, my general view is that we need to be lifting lockdown now.”On Wednesday NHS England announced just 166 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 25,080. The numbers of deaths have been falling by around 100 every seven days for the past month and there are also fewer than 10,000 people in hospital for the first time since March.A declining number of cases and deaths is one of the five tests the Government has set out for the easing of lockdown in the UK.Another is maintaining a low \u0027R\u0027 number, which tracks how many people the average coronavirus patient infects.Data modelling by Cambridge University\u0027s MRC Biostatistics Unit has already suggested the R number in London is significantly lower than elsewhere in the UK, hovering at around 0.4, compared to a national average of at least 0.7.Theresa Villiers, a former Cabinet minister, said the growing evidence for the decline of the virus should allow ministers to feel confident in easing lockdown more quickly using regional variations.“We need to get the economy going again,” she said. “There is real measured progress on getting new cases down that should be the signal to let life get back to normal.” However Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, urged caution.“The stats we are looking at have a few days lag. What we have seen in the past is this, London, is where the virus can flourish, in big cities. “This is fantastic news but the good work needs to be leveraged and not lost by celebrating too soon.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"earlier lockdown could have prevented three quarters uk coronavirus","story":"Three-quarters of coronavirus deaths in Britain might have been avoided if the lockdown had begun a week earlier, modelling suggests. Researchers said that if the UK had imposed the measures seven days earlier its death toll now would be on a par with the 8,000 in Germany.They also said it would have been possible to have a shorter and less economically damaging lockdown.Britain introduced its lockdown measures on March 23, when 359 deaths had been reported. Germany took such steps on the same day, but had reported only 86 fatalities at that time. The UK\u0027s death toll has now exceeded 35,000 people. Modelling from British scientist James Annan suggests that entering lockdown a week earlier would have reduced the number of deaths by three-quarters.Mr Annan, from Blueskiesresearch.org.uk, said an earlier lockdown would have been shorter and had less economic impact. In a related blog, he wrote: Implementing the lockdown one week earlier would have saved about 30,000 lives in the current wave (based on official numbers, which are themselves a substantial underestimate). It would also have made for a shorter, cheaper, less damaging lockdown in economic terms.Modellers said the calculations showed that even small changes in the timing of interventions could make a significant difference. Dr Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, said: In the early stages of an epidemic, the number of cases is growing exponentially. This means even a small change in the rate of spread or in the timing of interventions can make a big difference a short period of time down the line.It is clear that, had we locked down sooner, we would have reduced the spread earlier, limiting the number of cases and consequently the number of deaths. The other benefit of locking down earlier would have been bringing cases under control sooner and potentially allowing the release of lockdown sooner.The modelling was revealed on Radio 4\u0027s More or Less programme, which highlighted differences in the testing regimes used by different countries earlier in the epidemic, with Germany carrying out 50,000 tests daily at a time when the UK could not even achieve that weekly. As a result, at the point both countries entered lockdown, Germany had identified around 27,000 cases, when the UK had confirmed just 9,000, researchers said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"young adults likely age group infected coronavirus new data","story":"Young adults are the most likely age group to be infected with coronavirus, new figures suggest. Snapshot surveillance data suggests that those aged 17 to 29 are the most likely group to carry the infection - although they are far less likely than older people to fall seriously ill.The sampling by Public Health England (PHE), which occurred as the epidemic approached its peak, showed that in early April, around 11 per cent of those aged between 17 and 29 were infected with the virus.Those in their 30s were the age group with the second highest number of infections, at around 10 per cent, with rates closer to seven per cent among those in their 60s.Scientists said the findings reflected the fact young people were the most likely to socialise, and may also have been more likely to flout lockdown advice. The three-week period began on March 23 - the day the lockdown was introduced - meaning many of the findings would reflect social patterns before strict rules came in. Across the capital, levels of infection fell with age, the data suggests. Charts which show prevalence of infection in five age groups from 17-29 up to those aged between 60 and 70, in different regions, over three weeks, show that by and large, levels of infection fell with age. By contrast, the risk of dying from coronavirus rises sharply with age, with 26,800 deaths in those aged 75 and over, compared with around 400 in those aged 44 and under, official statistics show. Professor Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia said: “Young people are the most likely to socialise and the least likely to stick to social distancing guidelines.“So from that viewpoint, it’s not that surprising. In London it shows by April 12 around 11 per cent of 17 to 29 year olds had the infection, compared to seven per cent of those aged 60 to 70 – so a difference of more than half.”Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE\u0027s head of immunisation, said the findings about infection levels were the “exact opposite” to what was being seen in patterns of disease, where older people were far more affected. People who become infected with Covid-19 do not always become ill, with estimates that around one third of those carrying the virus do not show symptoms.Dr Ramsay told a webinar: “We see disease in older adults predominantly, whereas with infection we appear to be seeing it in younger adults.“It’s a very interesting finding and quite possibly unexpected. I think even the modelers found it unexpected that the infection rates appear to be higher in the young adults.“We have limited data from other regions, but the patterns are similar” Health Service Journal reported. The data suggests that over the three weeks ending on April 12, the rate of coronavirus infection rose from 3 per cent to 11 per cent among those aged between 17 and 29 in London.Dr Ramsay said: “We think that probably reflects the incidents just before the lockdown period. “What was fascinating was finding that it suggests transmission in London among young adults was particularly high, even though we were seeing the disease in a very different age group.Since late February, PHE has analysed thousands of blood samples from people across the country as part of a “seroprevalence study” carried out under the fourth pillar of the Government’s testing strategy. Dr Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE, said: “This is ongoing research and needs to be treated with caution, however it is helping us to better understand how the transmission of Covid-19 may be happening and we will be publishing further details in due course.“This is just one element of a range of surveillance systems that PHE has in place to monitor the pandemic.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"charts show uk road recovery","story":"By Saturday millions of people across the UK will have been under lockdown for two months, but now pockets are emerging across the country where the virus is being stamped out.The prevalence of Covid-19 has fallen by as much as 40 per cent in just two weeks, and statisticians have estimated deaths from the virus could be eliminated by next month.As the clamour for lifting lockdown grows, falling numbers of infections and deaths can provide hope, but they come amid stark warnings against undoing the hard work achieved since March and risking a second wave.The UK is now well beyond the peak in new cases, and the number of infections detected has fallen significantly throughout May.In the two weeks since May 6, the average number of new infections over the previous seven days dropped by almost 40 per cent (37.9).Fewer than 2,500 new cases were detected on May 20, almost 30 per cent lower than the same day the previous week.It comes after a worrying plateau in the number of new cases lasting since early April. For almost 40 days the average number of daily new cases failed to fall below 4,000, but recent days there has been a sharp decline.The delay has left the UK trailing its neighbours in feeling secure to venture out of lockdown.Denmark allowed schools to reopen on April 13, followed by some small businesses a week later. The country was one of the first in Europe to take action to arrest movement, imposing a lockdown on March 11, almost two weeks before the UK.In the Czech Republic a state of emergency was declared the same day, before the country had recorded its first death, and an easing of restrictions came on April 20.It meant total lockdown was only in place for 33 days in Denmark and 40 days in the Czech Republic.According to data released by the Office for National Statistics, it is now clear deaths from coronavirus in hospitals across England and Wales peaked in April 8, and the spike in care home deaths came just over a week later, around April 17.The Government has been roundly criticised for the lack of protection afforded to care homes, and while it is not yet clear what caused the delay in the peak of deaths, they are now are falling in all settings.In the fortnight between 24 April and 8 May, the number of weekly care home deaths fell by 40 per cent, and deaths in hospital fell by 59 per cent.It left more people dying from coronavirus in the community than in hospitals in England and Wales for the first time, paving the way for the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 to fall below 10,000 for the first time this week.Some leading statisticians have estimated deaths from coronavirus in Britain could peter out by the end of June if current trends continue, but warned hospitals and care homes need strict monitoring to ensure no further outbreaks..The number of deaths on Monday was 545, down from 627 a week ago, and the seven-day average is now 378. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that, on average, deaths are now falling at a rate of around 30 each day.Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, said that there would be a sporadic rise and fall in deaths over the next four to six weeks but he would not expect to find coronavirus listed in the ONS death data by the end of June. Speaking at a briefing in central London, Prof Henegan said: I think you can already see that regions are reporting 48 hours without deaths, trusts are starting to do that.I think by the end of June we\u0027ll be looking at the data and finding it difficult to find people with this illness in the deaths if the current trends continue.But we will continue to have these sporadic ups and downs for about four to six weeks. People shouldn\u0027t panic if we have no deaths for a couple of days and then we have eight or 10 because you will see that, as we go down to lower numbers, we will have a bit more variation in the data.As some of the smallest NHS trusts in England are beginning to enjoy successive days with no new Covid-19 deaths, many others have seen significant falls in fatalities.Of the 218 trusts covered in daily data from NHS England, some 167 have seen reductions in the number of coronavirus deaths between the periods of 8-14 April and 8-14 May, the latest period for which full and reliable data is available.The trusts which have seen the largest drops in the number of deaths are University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust in the Midlands, and London\u0027s Barts Health NHS Trust and the Royal Free London Nhs Foundation Trust.Find out how many NHS deaths there have been in your local Trust by searching the table belowThese trusts have seen the number of deaths in the weeks commencing 8 April and 8 May fall by 156, 126 and 97 respectively. University Hospitals Birmingham, a Trust at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus outbreak in the West Midlands, saw 180 deaths between 8 and 14 April, compared to just 24 between 8 and 14 May.While a handful of England\u0027s NHS trusts have seen more deaths between 8-14 May compared to 8-14 April, none have seen deaths increase by double figures.The trust which has seen the largest increase in coronavirus deaths between the 8-14 April and 8-14 May periods is Doncaster And Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, with deaths increasing from 22 to 28.The Government Office for Science has announced that the latest \u0027R\u0027 number range for the UK is now 0.7 to 1.0, up from 0.5 to 0.9 last weekend. The reproduction \u0027R\u0027 number is the average that shows many people one person with coronavirus will pass it on to.A government source said the epidemic had now largely moved into care homes and hospitals, and that the number of infections in the community was very, very little.Analysis by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University calculated on May 11 that the \u0027R\u0027 reproduction rate had fallen to 0.4 in London, with the number of new cases halving every 3.5 days.On March 23 – at the peak of contagion when lockdown was announced – 213,000 people a day caught the virus in London, according to the research.That fell dramatically as soon as the restrictions were brought in, tumbling below 10,000 by April 7. Despite significant progress made to reduce the spread of the virus in London, Mr Dowden said on Wednesday London\u0027s schools and non-essential retail stores would for now remain on the same timetable as the rest of the country. The Prime Minister set out the path we will go down in terms of easing the lockdown. He set out this three-stage process, he said.The next stage we\u0027ve said is from the beginning of June around for example opening up non-essential retail. Lockdown measures are expected to be eased further at the beginning of June, when some primary school children will be allowed to return to classrooms.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jilted woman dumps tonne onions ex boyfriends doorstep chinese","story":"A jilted Chinese woman has sent an unusual revenge gift to an ex-lover who broke up with her days before Chinese Valentine\u0027s Day - a truckload of onions dumped on his doorstep to bring him to tears.The woman in eastern China\u0027s Shandong province bought the tonne of onions online and had them delivered to her former boyfriend\u0027s house, saying it was his turn to cry.She ordered the delivery drivers to pile the eye-watering vegetable up on her ex-boyfriend\u0027s doorstep and leave without ringing the doorbell, reported Shandong Net, a news outlet affiliated with the local government.I cried for three days, and now it\u0027s your turn, she wrote in a note alongside the stinging gift.The woman, whose surname is Zhao, told Shandong Net that she had been in a relationship with her ex-boyfriend for nearly a year before the man decided to unilaterally break up.It caused me a lot of pain, but he refused to cry, Zhao said.So she said she decided to send a gift that would squeeze out his tears.Money is nothing.

The opening journey will be between Venice and London, with further dates and routings to follow shortly afterwards.Making the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express safe in the age of coronavirus represents a serious challenge. While beautifully decorated in the Art Deco style of the train’s 1930s heyday, compartments are, to put it mildly, cosy. In recent years lavish grand suites have been added to the mix, but – in keeping with the original – most of the compartments on the train do not have ensuite facilities and in the past, a rather endearing feature of journeys has been the nocturnal wanderings along narrow corridors to the shared facilities frequently brushing past fellow passengers on the way.Much of that is being rethought. Adrian Bridge has the details. A suite on the luxurious trainThe world\u0027s biggest passenger plane, the A380, was already falling from favour before the lockdown. Now it seems few will fly again. Air France, doubtful about post-lockdown demand for travel, now plans to put all of its A380s (nine in total) out to pasture. It follows Lufthansa retiring six of its 14 superjumbos last month, while Emirates, the largest operator of the aircraft, could ditch as much as half of its 100-strong fleet.Food and wine offer two very good reasons to visit Italy, but strict post-lockdown rules mean many of its most iconic restaurants are facing an existential threat.Venice\u0027s famed Harry\u0027s Bar, for example, the birthplace of the Bellini cocktail, has closed until further notice. We can\u0027t think about opening with just five or six people allowed inside at a time, owner Arrigo Cipriani told AP. Milan\u0027s fine-dining Manna restaurant will also remain closed for the foreseeable future, despite the easing of lockdown, while seven out of 10 restaurants on Rome\u0027s picturesque Piazza Navona were still shuttered on Wednesday. Sun-soaked, uncrowded, famously friendly and relatively corona-free, Greece sounds like the perfect destination for a post-lockdown holiday. But will it be welcoming Britons this summer? There are positive signs, with hotels given the green light to reopen from June 15 and direct international flights to tourist islands returning from July 1.  Speaking on Wednesday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said visitors would not be required to self-isolate but would be subject to coronavirus testing. The Foreign Office still advises against all but essential overseas travel, however, while the UK government\u0027s quarantine plans could make holidays impossible for the majority of Britons. Some fascinating quotes from a Government source have poured a large quantity of cold water over Grant Shapps\u0027s \u0027air bridges\u0027 scheme, and suggested the UK\u0027s proposed quarantine on overseas arrivals could be around for a while. It all sounds like very bad news for holidaymakers and tour operators. They suggested Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister\u0027s senior adviser, is a driving force behind the quarantine plan. Quarantine will mean all international travellers, including returning holidaymakers but excluding those from the Common Travel Area, will have to supply their contact and accommodation information and self-isolate for 14 days. Here\u0027s what we learnt on Wednesday: You might be able to visit Spain this summer, but probably an island, not a cityYou might also have to wear a face mask on the beachTravel restrictions are being lifted in Australia, Italy, India, Vietnam and beyondTravel bubbles, air bridges and sea bridges all (sort of) mean the same thing.

She explains: “It’s the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.”Why is it hard to take pop stars seriously as actors?What the pandemic reveals about the value of Tom Stoppard’s artBut, Hulk persuades the Ancient One to give him the Infinity Stone by telling her that Doctor Strange gave it away.The Ancient One concludes that Doctor Strange must have given it away for a good reason because “Strange is meant to be the best of us”, so she gives the stone over to Hulk. Here lies the inconsistency. In 2016’s Doctor Strange, the Ancient One refused to train Strange when he visited Kamar-Taj. If she knew the prophecy about the stone in 2012, why would she refuse to teach him?“Stubbornness. Arrogance. Ambition. I’ve seen it all before... I cannot lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness,” the Ancient One tells Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).Why, then, would the Ancient One would be so convinced of Strange’s ability four years earlier? Entrusting the Time Stone to a stranger, purely based on the news that it was his desire, seems like quite a big stretch.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And what does it mean for the government and for ordinary people?The UK government auctioned a tranche of debt to the financial markets on Wednesday which, for the first time in history, had a negative yield.That means that if the investors were to hold the debt until it matured they would get less back than they paid for it.Government borrowing this year heading to £300bn, says OBRSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut why would investors pay the government for the privilege of lending it money?And why is it happening now?What does it mean for the public finances?And how could it affect the livelihoods of ordinary people?The Debt Management Office, a public body that sells state debt on behalf of the Government, auctioned a parcel of state debt worth £3.75bn to financial investors, a group that generally includes banks, insurance companies, pension managers and hedge funds.The parcel of debt – known as a Gilt-edged security or “Gilt” – is due to mature in July 2023, which is the date that the holders of the Gilt would be repaid their money by the government.The yield on the Gilt is the effective annual interest rate that the investors receive and is determined by the price investors pay to buy the security.The yield on this Gilt, as set by a competitive auction, was -0.003 per cent.Gilt yields have been very low for many years, but this is the first time that the yield on a Gilt has been negative. And the implication is that the investors would ultimately lose money on their investment.Why on earth would investors buy these bonds if it guarantees they will lose money?First it’s important to note that negative yielding government debt has been a feature of several other governments’ bond markets in recent years.Japan and Germany have issued debt at negative yields for some time.Indeed the total value of negative yielding debt around the world at the end of last year was $11 trillion, having peaked at $17 trillion. That’s around a sixth of the total global bond market.Negative yields remain something of a puzzle, but the most common explanation from analysts is that investors, in an era of considerable uncertainty and volatility in markets, are prepared to pay a big premium for the confidence that they will get most of their money back, even if it means a slight loss.Regulation may play a part too, with pension funds, banks and insurance companies effectively compelled since the global financial crisis by regulators to hold more liquid (easily sellable) assets like government bonds as a share of their total assets.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt may also be that some investors are speculating that Government bond prices are going to go up even more in future and that they will still be able to sell their own holdings at a profit in future, even if they have a negative yield when they buy them.So why have UK yields only gone negative now?The most likely explanation is that it’s because the Bank of England has signalled in recent days that it is considering taking its main interest rate negative for the first time.Central bank interest rates tend to have a big influence on bond yields.Why has the interest rate on UK debt fallen to record lows?Those countries that have seen negative yields already have negative interest rates from their own central banks.The Bank is also expected to announce more Gilt purchases soon as part of its response to the Covid-19 recession, which may be bolstering the confidence of some speculators that they will be able to sell their negative yielding Gilts to the central bank at a profit.“The impact of the Bank of England’s rate cuts and increased asset purchases is absolutely clear from this morning’s groundbreaking gilt auction,” said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.What does this mean for the Government?In the immediate term it signals strong market demand for Government debt, which is comforting at a time when it is expecting to issue more than £300bn of Gilts in order to pay for its emergency coronavirus spending.Low or negative yields also mean that the Government does not need to worry much about the annual costs of servicing that borrowing.What does it all mean for ordinary people?A government with stable market financing is good news for people receiving state assistance in this crisis because it diminishes the risk these programmes would have to be ended suddenly because the government could not borrow.However, the fact that bond yields are so low probably reflects pessimism from investors about the economy’s medium and long-term economic prospects.If investors thought the economy was going to grow strongly in the years and decades ahead they would be expecting higher inflation in the years ahead and would probably be charging the government more to borrow in the form of higher yields.If investors are right about the bleak overall economic outlook that’s bad news for ordinary workers and households.And low bond yields means the return on many pension saving pots will be lower, meaning people might have to work longer to achieve a financially comfortable retirement.

Google Docs, and to a lesser extent Apple’s Pages, let users create a document or table that can be shared in its totality quickly and easily via a link or through downloading the file.Fluid Framework, however, is focused on people creating components of documents – such as text, tables, lists, and graphs.Microsoft wants to \u0027read people\u0027s brain waves\u0027 to mine cryptocurrencyThese components can be updated and editable at any time, no matter where they are created or how they are shared. These can then be incorporated into other Microsoft products, such as Teams (its collaboration platform and Slack competitor).In order to attract someone’s attention to a component that has been created, Fluid workspaces have ‘recommended’ lists and the ability to tag someone through what Microsoft calls “@mentions”.Microsoft is hoping that this infrastructure will become the future of workplace collaboration. The Fluid preview and, it can be assumed, future versions of the software is currently available on the latest version of all major browsers: Microsoft Edge, Apple’s Safari (but only on Apple computers), Google Chrome, and Mozilla’s Firefox.Xbox Live feature turned off as Microsoft reports \u0027record numbers\u0027Microsoft reveals range of new details about Xbox Series XBill Gates’ coronavirus testing programme is testing 300 people a dayWhile the roll-out will take time, it will begin with the web versions of Office and Outlook before eventually coming to Teams later in the year. Eventually, Fluid will be compatible with all Office programmes including Excel, Word, and Powerpoint on the desktop.As well as its new framework, Microsoft also announced developments for Teams including customisable templates, more manageable chatbots, and the ability to add custom applications to Teams with a dedicated button.​Outlook is also receiving new features including text predictions, which Google’s Gmail has had for two years, while Microsoft Edge is receiving sidebar searching (so you can search without opening a new window) and automatic profile switching. The latter will be a useful feature for those who use Edge for both work and personal browsing, as it will automatically switch to your work profile when it detects a link you’re trying to open needs specific credentials.Finally, Microsoft is introducing new tools to PowerToys, its free system utilities, including “PowerToys Run”, a searchbar which allows users to quickly access system tools like the registry or the startup utility settings, while also letting you remap keys and search for files.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That such a galaxy could form so early in the history of the universe indicates that our traditional understanding – where galaxies build up in hierarchies, late in the history of the cosmos – could be wrong.The discovery could help answer the puzzle over one of the most profound questions in cosmology: how the universe changed from its bland, formless state at its very beginning to the complex and structured web of stars and galaxies that surround us today.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs well as being by far the earliest such disc ever spotted, it is also the most distant ever seen, and it is so far away that scientists are able to see it at a point when the universe was only a tenth of its current age. The object, nicknamed the Wolfe Disc, is spinning at 170 miles per second and has a mass 72 billion times that of our Sun.Our current understanding of galaxies suggests that dark matter “halos” first develop, which then pull in surrounding gas and merge into bigger structures from which stars are formed. As time goes on, that leads to the growth of galaxies.Comet flying towards Earth could be visible with the naked eyeSuch a model suggests that as the gas falls into the disc, it is heated up, leaving a spherical structure that has to cool before it can support the formation of a disc.But the newly discovered galaxy contains a cold, dusty, rotating disc, despite the fact that it formed so early in the universe. That suggests that the gas could have been cool as it fell into the nascent galaxy, allowing for the disc to form quickly.If that is the case, massive gas discs could form 2.5 billion years earlier than scientists had thought, according to the research published by Marcel Neeleman and colleagues in Nature.Such “cold-mode accretion” would change our picture of when and how such disc galaxies – which includes our own Milky Way – are able to form. That in turn could change our comprehension of the universe, by allowing us a better picture of how matter is first assembled into the larger structures that surround us.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Xavier Prochaska, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and coauthor of the paper. “Still, one of the questions that remains is how to assemble such a large gas mass while maintaining a relatively stable, rotating disk.”The finding is based only on one galaxy and so it is difficult to generalise from the findings, notes Alfred Tiley from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research​, who did not work on the study, in an accompanying article. As such, similar observations of more galaxies are required before scientists can say that the newly discovered disc is representative of a broader trend, he writes.“Nevertheless, Neeleman and colleagues’ findings will excite astronomers, and open up a new epoch of the Universe’s history for the study of early galaxy formation,” Dr Tiley concludes.The research, ‘A cold, massive, rotating disk galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang’, is published in Nature today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been suggested that the Alan Partridge star is “taking advantage” of the scheme due to his staff being unable to travel to his house as the pandemic continues.But, on Wednesday (20 May), Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen commented on Coogan’s decision to stop paying his staff, saying: “The furlough scheme is to protect businesses that are suspended and can’t operate during the coronavirus pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It’d be difficult to see how Steve Coogan’s earning potential has been diminished. The grass is still growing in his back garden and his house still needs cleaning.”Bridgen said of t he outspoken Labour supporter: “He’s certainly a Conservative voter now.”A source close to Coogan’s staff told The Sun that it was impossible for them to keep working with the social distancing regulations that are in place.Why is it hard to take pop stars seriously as actors?Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan’s 10 best impressions from The TripWhat the pandemic reveals about the value of Tom Stoppard’s art“The workers are gutted they can’t make it in because of the coronavirus situation,” they said. “It was established it wouldn’t be possible to continue working with the social distancing measures in place.“So Coogan took advantage of the furlough scheme while they’re unable to come in.”Earlier this year, Coogan said he was nothing like the billionaire fashion mogul he plays in his film Greed “I pay for everything,” he said, adding: “I don’t get anything for free.”Victoria Beckham reversed her decision to furlough 30 members of staff at her eponymous fashion brand after the move received much criticism The Independent has contacted Coogan for comment.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The EU wants what it calls a level playing-field clause in the deal, under which the UK would stay in tune with some regulations such as state aid and environmental protections.Former Tory minister calls for ‘phased’ end to free movementUK blames EU’s ‘ideological’ approach for lack of Brexit progressIn a broadside at the approach taken by the UK negotiator, Mr Barnier said: I do not think, however, that an exchange of letters regarding the substance of the negotiations is necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points.He said the EU was sticking to the political declaration that had been signed by Boris Johnson and which spells out the approach both sides would take to their future relationship.In his letter on Tuesday, Mr Frost said Brussels\u0027 proposed deal contains novel and unbalanced proposals which would bind this country to EU law or standards. The UK published its own legal text on Tuesday, which the EU has already been privately privy for a number of weeks.But Mr Barnier said: The UK cannot expect high-quality access to the EU Single Market if it is not prepared to accept guarantees to ensure that competition remains open and fair. The EU has been clear about this since 2017.The chief negotiator said this would not mean that the UK would be bound by EU law after the end of the transition period in these areas and that the UK will remain entirely free to set its own higher standards but that we need to give ourselves concrete, mutual and reciprocal guarantees for this to happen.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In 2017-18, £55bn of taxable capital gains were recorded – more than double the amount recorded just five years earlierThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Domino Park, a six-acre park located off the East River in Williamsburg, has been covered with white circles meant to encourage social distancing in the era of Covid-19. A video shared online showed residents lounging in the circles, which are about six feet in diameter and spaced away from other circles to remind residents to not interact with others.

Lee in the caption to her video. Three months ago the idea of positioning oneself in a painted circle to lounge outside would be a bizarre concept. But now most residents have embraced the park’s guidelines and followed social distancing measures by only sitting in the circles when on the turf.“If you were to take video footage from the world today and show it to someone from 2019, they would think it was from some near-future Hollywood dystopian television show instead of real life,” Ms Lee said. Pictures taken on Monday also showed a majority of residents using the circles and wearing masks when at Domino Park. The public park is owned by a private company and not operated by New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other government officials have collaborated with the NYPD to encourage residents to practice coronavirus protective measures when outdoors, such as passing out masks at parks. Signs also popped up at a number of parks and locations around the city to remind people to stay apart from others when out. Last week the mayor said there would be limits to capacity of parks like Domino Park, Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and piers 45 and 46 in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park over the weekend.

The Indonesian government has done little to stop the trade of wildlife in the country\u0027s markets.Earlier this month, a coalition of animal rights groups wrote to Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo warning him of the risks posed by the trade of wildlife, as well as dog and cat meat, in the country’s live animal markets.The Dog Meat Free Indonesia coalition wrote: “Despite the worsening situation of the pandemic globally and throughout Indonesia, with all 34 provinces now affected and over 13,000 coronavirus infections and nearly 1,000 deaths nationwide, the sale of wild animals including bats, rats and reptiles alongside dogs and cats and other domesticated animals in markets throughout the country continues unchallenged.“This is in defiance to ever-growing calls from governments, inter-governmental human and animal health experts and key stakeholders from around the world for the immediate closure of live animal markets globally.“It is impossible to ensure that meat sold at these markets is safe for human consumption, and given the unhygienic conditions, it is only a matter of time before the next deadly zoonotic disease emerges.”The Animals Asia Foundation was one of the charities in the coalition who signed the letter. The founder, Dr Jill Robinson MBE, expressed her “100 per cent” support for The Independent’s campaign to ban the wildlife trade.Founder of leading animal charity backs The Independent\u0027s campaignDr Robinson told The Independent that live animal markets are “dirty, dangerous places” that cannot be properly regulated, least of all in countries where “no animal welfare regulations exist, or are poorly enforced if they do”.The trade of wildlife was thrown into the spotlight as the coronavirus is believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. 27 of the first 41 people who became infected with Covid-19 had been exposed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, according to a study published in medical journal, The Lancet.Researchers believe the Covid-19 jumped from an animal to a human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The local administration in the Chinese city said on Wednesday that along with the consumption ban, Wuhan would become a “wildlife sanctuary” where virtually all hunting of wild animals was banned with the exception of measures for ”scientific research, population regulation, monitoring of epidemic diseases and other special circumstances”. As part of the ban, the city introduced stringent controls on the breeding of all wild animals, prohibiting any to be reared for food, CBS reported. Wuhan will also join a wider scheme across the country to offer buyouts to farmers who breed wild animals.​Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFounder of leading animal charity backs The Independent’s campaignWoman jailed for illegal trade in wildlife has sentence doubledArmy of volunteers ‘could be used to fight off invasive species’Coronavirus fears as China plans to entrench mink and fox fur industryWuhan, a city of 11m people in the Hubei province of China, saw the first cases of Covid-19 late last year. The origins of the pandemic are still being investigated but one of the suspected sources is the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city which included a live animal section reportedly selling more than 30 species of animals including live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions and civets. China closed the market in January.On the whole, researchers agree that the most plausible explanation is that the virus made the jump from an animal to human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.China has been under pressure from the global community to tackle its illegal wildlife trade after it was linked to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Coronavirus: China’s farmers offered buy-out to end wildlife breedingThe global death toll is now 318,789 people from the coronavirus, the World Health Organisation reported today. More than 4.7m people have been infected worldwide. Last week, two central provinces in China announced plans for a government buy-out for wildlife farmers to help transition those whose livelihoods depend on breeding wild species for consumption away from the practice.The plans would give wildlife farmers in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, two neighbouring regions, the opportunity to be compensated for switching to grow fruit, vegetables, tea plants, or herbs for traditional Chinese medicine. There is also an option to breed other animals such as pigs and chickens.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Each wild goose or Chinese muntjac deer will be worth 2,457 yuan ($345) each.In February, China issued an unprecedented temporary nationwide ban on all terrestrial wild animal commerce and consumption, including exotic species raised on farms. The initial buy-out covers 14 species of farmed wildlife and only farms operating legally with breeding permits before the February ban are eligible for the programme.At present, the Wuhan ban lasts for five years. Similar bans are in place in the cities of Beijing, Shenzhen and Zhuhai but they have been made permanent.Dr Peter Li, Humane Society International’s China policy specialist, said: “Wuhan’s ban on wildlife consumption is extremely welcome as a clear recognition that the public health risk of zoonotic disease spread via the wildlife trade must be taken very seriously if we are to avoid another pandemic.There will however be no less severe of a disease risk from wildlife consumption in five years’ time, so anything short of a permanent and comprehensive ban is still a risk too far. Wuhan becomes the fourth city in mainland China to show such leadership, but we now need cities and countries across the world to step up to the plate and shut down the dangerous wildlife trade.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK.

Contactless payment is thought to be a must ­and some may use new apps to order and pay.It is easier to space drinkers out in a beer garden and scientists say the virus spreads less outside, compared to within enclosed spaces.That means it will be a while before small, cosy pubs re-open their doors to customers.But big pubs where there is enough room inside to keep people apart could be next to get the nod — again with table service to avoid a build-up at bars.Perspex screens, like those seen in supermarkets, could be used to shield diners from other tables and walkways.Eventually, when ordering at a bar is allowed — perhaps in the autumn — screens might also be put up on the counters.Environment Secretary George Eustice told the Commons: We are already working with the hospitality and pub sector to identy what social distancing measures they might be able to put in place.“As the Prime Minister has outlined, we intend that the hospitality sector, including pubs, would be able to tentatively start gradually opening, hopefully during July — subject to the epidemiology supporting such a move.”He was referring to phase three of the lockdown easing plan, which includes pubs. The talks come as welcome news for lockdown Brits keen to catch up with friends and family over a pint away from home.Mr Eustice added: Of course we also recognise that until thingsto something closer to normal and they can open normally, hopefully later this summer, then it will not give them all of the trade they previously had.There were fears that pubs might not reopen until Christmas because of the dficulties with social distancing.Pub bosses on Monday called for the two-metrerule to be halved.In some cases it would allow so few customers it might not be economical to open.Simon Emeny, the chief executive of brewer Fuller’s, said the World Health Organisation advises one metre— which would allow four times as many customers. He said: “I think it’s really important that rules are relaxed by the time pubs reopen.”Jonathan Neame, chief executive of Shepherd Neame, said it would be “profoundly challenging” to keep people two metres apart ­and that could force most pubs to stay shut.”The British Beer and Pub Association’s chief executive Emma McClarkin warned that a long-term shutdown would have a devastating impact on an industry already in decline.“We stand ready to work with the Government to help pubs re-open in a safe and financially viable way as soon as possible.“Actioning advice from the WHO — for example to use one metre for social distancing from July — would enable many more pubs to viably re-open and serve their communities again.”Brewers and pubs have already had to dispose of the equivalent of million pints of beer that had gone stale.Opening pub gardens gives them some hope — and would allow the two-metre rule to stay for now. In mid-May Boris Johnson laid out the first careful steps of easing the coronavirus lockdown as part of a three-phase plan to get back to normal le.In an address to the nation he revealed a detailed roadmap of how to get Britain back on its feet, but still keep the deadly virus under control.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They had two daughters Kiristiana, , and Alicia, .It is believed Mr Tachmintzis was so concerned about security he kept Dobermans as guard dogs and employed staff to stand on his gate.One neighbour told MailOnline: “I ride my horse down the road every day and all of a sudden I realised around three years ago that the people there had just disappeared.“I just thought at first that they had gone away somewhere and would then come back – but nobody did. It is most strange.“At first the gates were just shut and then a padlock and chain appeared on them. You could just see the grass getting longer and longer and growing around the cars.“Nobody around here has a clue what happened to them and why they just upped and left. It is a real mystery.“They obviously had loads of money because it is a big house. There were always lots of comings and goings with dferent people going in and out.“They used to have up to three Dobermans. His two daughters would walk them, and sometimes the cleaner would take them out, but they were too big for her to handle and she had to stop.“One day around six-years-ago, this guy in his s came out and said that his dogs had gone missing and he askedwe had seen them, but we hadnt.“The girls were dark haired and very pretty. I think they used to go to a local health club and gym.”Another villager said he heard Mr Tachmintzis made a huge deal involving a luxury property on the exclusive Sandbanks resort in Dorset.They said: “I believe his we had cancer and died several years ago.“He also had a housekeeper, but she left suddenly. It is certainly very odd. Nobody knows what caused them to leave the house, seemingly never to .”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It can affect you,” Schultz told BuzzFeed.“I knew what I thought going in [about the coronavirus]. I didn’t think it was as serious as it was until after things started happening.“I thought I was young enough for it not to affect me, and I know a lot of people think that.“I was so weak. This was one of the most frustrating parts. I couldn’t hold my cellphone — it was so heavy. I couldn’t type, because my hands shook so much.”Schultz, who was hospitalized on March , had traveled to Boston to visit his boyfriend, Josh Hebblethwaite, , on March .A week before, they had been to a festival in Miami Beach where at least  people later contracted COVID- and three men died.But Schultz said there were no real restrictions in place, though. No lockdowns.Days after arriving in Boston, he began feeling ill and was soon rushed to hospital with a -degree fever and his lungs full of liquid.He was given oxygen and sedated before being transferred to another hospital where he was intubated for over four weeks.“There was no one  around, and I would be the one to make decisions for him,” Hebblethwaite said. “It was definitely scary.”“About four weeks in, the nurses were nice enough to FaceTime with him.It was pretty much like he was in a coma. It was definitely scary. But I was so happy to see him at that point.”The couple say theyve received a lot of abuse for attending the Florida festival, with some people saying Schultz deserved to get sick.But he said the positive feedback has outweighed the negative comments.After being released from hospital, he enjoyed the two double cheeseburgers, small fries and a strawberry shake he ordered at McDonald’s, although he said his taste was somewhat affected.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Government furlough system was set up as a fallback to keep people in jobs, not to protect the wealth of multi-millionaires or billionaires by paying their staff for them.Many families who can afford cleaners have dug deep to keep them solvent during this crisis. They have not demanded the public bail them out.Coogan could pay his staff in full without denting even a fraction of the interest on his riches. Instead he chose to make taxpayers do it.That’s greed, all right.

Its vast bureaucratic institutions were utterly unable to react to the threat of the virus.So the inidual countries did it all for themselves. Each following a dferent policy. When the moment came, the EU was found wanting. Lethargic, hopeless and riven with internal dispute.There is fury in Spain that the EUwon’t bung them loads of money for being badly hit by the virus.It’s the same in Italy, where  per cent of the population now want to LEAVE the EU. The country that was usually one of the EU’s biggest cheerleaders.A disillusion with the EU is spreading across the continent.People are beginning to see that it’s a good thing to have control of your borders. And that the best way of controlling those borders is through a nation state.The Greeks have been trying to contain a mass influx of refugees from Turkey — and getting no help from the EU in the process. Some senior EU politicians fear that the virus could kill off the EU altogether. Right now it’s on a ventilator and looking very sorry for itself.We can only hope — for the good of our European friends — that someone switches that ventilator off.Once we all emerge from lockdown there will be a financial price to pay. Our economy — the world’s economy — has taken a hell of a battering.But the good news is that we will be in with a much better chance of a full recovery than the EU bloc.From  you will no longer have to pay tarfs on a vast range of goods imported from beyond Europe.I suspect it will lead to a consumer bonanza — which is just what we want. Washing machines, freezers, women’s sanitary products, bicycle inner tubes, Christmas trees — the list of stuff which will be cheaper is almost endless.It’s true thatthe EU refuses to soften its stance about a trade deal with us, then we’ll pay more for cars made on the continent.But even that might have its upside. It will encourage people to buy British. Last year Brits bought only , cars that had been manufactured in the UK. The majority of cars were bought from German plants. Your loss, Germany.The EU negotiators are still being intransigent. They still think they can bully this country.Michael Gove has told them to get real. Sort out an acceptable trade deal for the good of the entire European economy.But eventhey don’t — evenreality fails to establish itself inside their closed minds— it will be the EU that loses out.It wouldn’t surprise me hugelyCovid- outlasted the European Union, frankly. We should all breathe a sigh of relief that we got the hell out of that helpless institution.Just in time.I WONDERCovid- will see an end to hard cash  My local shopkeepers tell me that almost no transactions in the past two months have been paid in cash. It’s all done by card.I’ve had the same  quid in my pocket that was there on March .I bet we don’t go back to paying in cash once this is over. Queuing for ages behind some addled berk at the ATM who is incapable of pressing the right buttons. Cash is going the way of the dinosaurs.And it’s not too far of a stretch to suggest that offices might be on their way out, either. Hugely expensive things to run, offices. And the original reason we had them was to store paper – files and so on. Don’t really need that any more, do we  People have discovered that working from home has many benefits. Not least the pleasure of avoiding pointless meetings with idiots.And for those who feel the need to get away from their families on a daily basis there’s “co-working environments”, or “the park with a load of booze”, as I like to call it.MOST lady slebs are busy during lockdown taking pictures of themselves wearing almost no clothes.Either to advertise products nobody really wants or to advertise themselves. For which many thanks, girls.Scarcely a day goes by without one of them taking a perfectly natural selfie of herself with hardly any clothes on, pouting at the camera like a trout with a botched facelt.Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has gone a stage further and posted pics of herself taken  years ago. Just in case we’d forgotten.I might get in on the act. Next week I’ll take a selfie wearing a leather thong and nipple clamps, advertising my new skincare product made from vole’s urine.Watch this space.I’m not so sure. Boredom is a greatly underrated virtue. It makes you get off your backside and do something. And our kids have been bored senseless for two months now.You never know, this break might do the kids some good. Fire their imaginations or something.And better still – it means they’re not having left-wing drivel drilled into their heads by the teachers…THE English Football League is in a right old mess.None of its three isions can agree what to do about finishing the season.The clubs in the lowest tier, ision two, have voted to end the season immediately. Those in the Championship want to finish the season, while League One clubs haven’t a clue.There’s talk of Coventry and Rotherham being promoted and a play-off between the next EIGHT clubs.I know a lot of money is at stake. I know the league has signed big deals with the broad- casters. But the sensible thing surely would have been to call the season null and void, across all three isions.Those of us who, like me, support clubs who had a chance of promotion will get over our disappointment.There are more important things than football.So let’s look at Sweden. It became the country with the highest death rate per capita from Covid- in Europe during thesevendays to May .The lockdown has unquestionably saved lives.LAST Friday night I was called  times in the space of an hour by the SAME NUMBER.What’s more, my phone told me the call was coming from Tajikistan. But every time I tried to answer, the caller hung up. That’s totally unfair.I have never in my le spoken to a person from Tajikistan. And I would very much like to do so. It might be interesting.I’m sure it was a criminal of some kind, but that’s not the point.I wanted to knowmy caller was a member of the mysterious Yaghnobi people, who live in the mountains in the north of the country, with their many goats. That would have been exciting.I might start ringing up numbers in Tajikistan indiscriminately. And then move on to Kyrgyzstan.That’s what lockdown does to you.For this they have been attacked by “human rights activists”.Perhaps.But not by the people of Hungary, who fully agree with this measure.Much as I suspect people would over here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead they will expand existing border screening to carry out the additional checks.And the government documents made clear that the checks will be conducted by UK border officials, snubbing EU demands to have their own personnel carrying out checks.It set up another big row with Brussels, which wanted to install a permanent base in Northern Ireland to oversee the checks.But Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who unveiled the UK plans in the Commons on Wednesday, admitted that Northern Ireland will have to follow EU rules on agriculture and manufactured goods until at least .The key concession will ensure access to the EU’s single market and keep the border with the Republic of Ireland free-flowing in order to maintain the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement.The Government paper said having a so-called “mini-EU embassy” in Belfast would be “isive” and called on Brussels to “respect the UK’s territorial integrity”.It also promised Northern Ireland businesses would benefit from “unfettered access” when selling goods to the rest of the UK. It ended a row over whether checks would be in place on goods entering the UK from Northern Ireland.Mr Gove, minister in charge of Brexit preparations, said: Our proposals will deliver unfettered access for Northern Ireland businesses to the whole of the UK market ensure there are no tarfs on goods remaining within the UK customs territory discharge our obligations without the need for any new customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland and, finally, guarantee that Northern Ireland businesses benefit from the lower tarfs we deliver through our new free trade agreements with third countries.The plans were given a cautious initial welcome by the EU last night, who said they will be monitoring the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol closely.A European Commission spokesman said: “The detailed legal commitments set out in the Protocol must now be implemented precisely to give full effect to this solution.The time to implement the Protocol is short, and practical implementation measures must start immediately so that the Protocol can be operational by  January . To this end, the Commission stands ready to work with the UK authorities.”In a further sign of relations souring between the two sides, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier last night hit out at the “tone” of his opposite number David Frost.He said a “new dynamism” was needed in talksthe two sides are to avoid a “stalemate”.Mr Barnier was hitting back at a furious letter from Mr Frost that was highly critical of the EU’s rigid approach to the negotiations.Mr Frost said Brussels proposed deal contains novel and unbalanced proposals which would bind this country to EU law or standards.He said: What is on offer is not a fair free trade relationship between close economic partners, but a relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions.”In his reply, Mr Barnier said he did not think an exchange of letters regarding the substance of the negotiations is necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points.He added: It cannot be a substitute for serious engagement and detailed negotiations and, in particular, I would not like the tone that you have taken to impact the mutual trust and constructive attitude that is essential between us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The crumbling estate is owned by the elusive property tycoons Heinrich and Dwora Feldman through their business Manaquel Company Ltd. The couple, now in their eighties, were placed at number  in the Sunday Times Rich List published last weekend, which put their wealth at £million. What immediately strikes you about Dorchester Court in Lambeth, South London, are the wooden beams holding up the balconies because the brickwork and steel supports have corroded. Ben Archard lives on the estate with his we Emmanuelle and two children and says pleas to the landlord to carry out repairs date back to the s. “Dorchester Court could be such an amazing place to live,” he says. “The architects designed somewhere that wasnapost just nice to look at, it was built in a way that brings its residents together into a community. “The crying shame is that the landlord doesnapost respect, or even understand, what he has. For years weaposve been trying to get the buildings looked after, the conditions here are awful, but all weaposve had inis bad management, neglect and a selfish desire to treat the place as a cash cow. Itaposs just so frustrating and demoralising. “Now the landlord wants to build  flats on top of the roofs without even committing to fixing the existing problems, and he plans to evict most of the residents to do it. “Dorchester Court and our wonderful community deserve so much better than this. We need something to change soon or it may become too late to save the place. “We have just received a report from a structural engineer which states ‘It is obvious that the lack of regular maintenance has accelerated the deterioration of the buildings’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"areas primary schools could refuse","story":"NewsCoronavirus: All the areas where primary schools could refuse to open on June Primary schools in England were due to reopen on June  but thousands could now wait longer or defy the government altogether.

Englandaposs primaries were told to prepare to bring back year R,  and  pupils back to class, with other primary years ing later in June.  But those plans were hurled into doubt by a mass revolt from unions and councils. Liverpool, Hartlepool, Birmingham, and even Tory-run Solihull and Essex have warned June  might not be possible. Some are looking at later dates, some are still waiting to see what will happen, and some are suggesting s may be part-time - despite the government saying this isnapost an option.Schools are of course already open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. But plans to open them more widely - which involves halving class sizes, hiding away toys, having staggered breaks and making corridors one-way - have ided many in the teaching profession. They need time to prepare, and also want to see the full scientic evidence on whether itaposll be safe. Scientists have also said the government should wait until after a delayed test, track and trace app is up and running. AskedLabour would back councils refusing to open on June , a spokesman for Keir Starmer said: “Ultimately councils will want to do what is in the best interests of children and families in their respective area. The infection rate ies from area to area so it’s not surprising some councils have particular concerns.” The government has insisted the June  date was at the earliest and schools wouldnapost be reopenedit was unsafe. Today one minister, Robert Buckland, admitted they may not open unormly across England. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland they will remain shut to the wider population. So what have dissenting councils in England said  Hereaposs what we know so far. These are all the areas weaposve found so far expressing doubt about the governmentaposs plans. But the situation is changing fast so itaposs inevitable some are probably left out. If you know one which should be added to this list, please e-mail dan.bloom@mirror. Barking and Dagenham Council leader Darren Rowell: “I cannot support any school reopeningit puts at risk the safety of our teachers, staff and young people.. Simply forcing schools to reopen without taking steps to reduce the risk of the virus spread is unacceptable… We can’t put people at risk by rushing back to normality before it’s safe.” Birmingham We only support Birmingham schools opening to more pupils when it is safe to do so. We are committed to having due regard to the guidance that has been issued by the government. However, we recognise that for some schools, opening to more pupils safely may not be possible on  June.  Bradford Bradford Council has no intention of directing schools to open on June  or to force parents to send their children back and we are committed to working in partnership with school leaders, families and trade unions so that they can make sure their schools are safe environments for our children whenever they choose to open. Parents will not be finedthey choose not to send their children back to school at this time. Brighton and Hove We have strongly advised our schools that they should only reopen to more children when their risk assessments indicate it is safe to do so. It is likely that wider re-opening will happen at dferent times for dferent schools and for dferent numbers of children, given each school’s particular circumstances. Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees: You cannot just make a blanket statement on Bristol. What we’ve said is we will back our schools to make the decision they have to make. Bury While high levels of Covid- infection in the north west remain, and guidance around practical arrangements for social distancing within educational environments, testing and tracing, and supply of PPE is unclear, the borough will not be re-opening schools on June .  Calderdale Adam Wilkinson, lead member for children and young people: We are advising schools in Calderdale not to extend opening on  June. We are keen to get more pupils back to school, but safety is of paramount importance  we have been advised by public health professionals that governments key tests have not been met. Durham Schools in County Durham are being advised that they should only start a phased reopening when they feel it is safe to do so.  Essex Whilst all schools are working hard to respond to the guidance provided by the Department for Education, depending on each inidual school context, some primary, infant and junior schools may not be able to offer full-time provision for the relevant year groups, and any new arrangements may not be introduced exactly from the st June. Gateshead We have absolute confidence that each school will determine the risk, and will make the right decision for their schools, pupils, staff and parents. The council will fully support any school that after careful consideration of all these factors, determines that they cannot comply with government instruction. Hartlepool We have agreed [schools] will not reopen on Monday  June. Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"calls urgent public inquiry uk","story":"NewsCalls for urgent public inquiry into UK coronavirus response as death toll hits ,EXCLUSIVE: Top scientists and health professionals warn that lessons must be learned from the handling of the deadly disease before a second spike hits the UKShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAY NewsPM Boris Johnson addresses the nation about coronavirus \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The experts branded the death toll in care homes a “scandal” and attacked the Government for failing to deal adequately with the first wave of Covid-. More than , people have signed a petition calling for an independent inquiry launched by campaign group March for Change. Ministers have not yet agreed to a public inquiry but have accepted that there will have to be a moment where they have to look back. At the No  briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: “Of course in any public health crisis there will be a time for lessons to be learned afterwards.” For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog HERE. But Justice Secretary Robert Buckland added: “It would be very dficult now to judge what happened in March, bearing in mind the change in our knowledge.” Labour leader Keir Starmer has said it was “inevitable” there would be an official inquiry but the party has not yet called for one.However, it has demanded a probe into Covid- deaths in care homes, saying staff and residents had been tragically let down. Dr Kailash Chand, former deputy chair of the BMA Council, said: “The UK is a world-leader in the fields of science and healthcare, and our NHS is the envy of the world. “Despite this, we now have the highest number of deaths in Europe and the situation in our care homes is nothing short of a scandal. “Governments and media from across the globe, from Australia to Germany, are using the UK as an example of how not to tackle the crisis.  “It is time that we, the public, hold this government to account by demanding an urgent and independent public inquiry.” His concerns were echoed by Professor Dame Anne Glover, President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh who said: “More than  in  of coronavirus deaths worldwide have been in the UK. The UK government has struggled to deliver an effective response. “Faced with the potential of a second wave this winter, compounded with seasonal flu, we now need an urgent and independent public inquiry to ensure we all learn the lessons while we still have time to prepare.” Professor Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, added: “We clearly failed in the first wave and, with the possibility of a second wave come winter, we must make every effort to learn the lessons and be better prepared. “The public inquiry must be fast, independent and transparent to ensure we never again allow our NHS and care workers – and all key workers – to fight this battle without the adequate support and protection.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus mayors plea stop thousands","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Mayors plea to stop thousands of rough sleepers ing to the streetsLabour leader Keir Starmer joined the plea from the Labour leaders of Manchester, Liverpool, London, Sheffield and North Tyne as special funding comes close to running dryShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAY NewsThe initial funding package for the ‘Everyone In’ scheme is due to run out within weeks\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Labour leaders of Manchester, Liverpool, London, Sheffield and North Tyne regions have urged ministers to deliver a new funding package to keep thousands of homeless off the streets.During the coronavirus pandemic more than , rough sleepers have been offered emergency accommodation, including in hotels. The initial funding package for the ‘Everyone In’ scheme is due to run out within weeks. But ministers have so far failed to commit to getting those rough sleepers into longer-term accommodation, saying it is the responsibility of already cash-strapped local authorities. But although councils have received extra funding to help respond to the coronavirus crisis, they claim that it is not anywhere near enough.Labour leader Keir Starmer joined the mayors to warn that a failure to act could mean thousands of rough sleepers ending up back on the streets.In a joint statement, they said: “The Government has rightly committed to protecting vulnerable rough sleepers for the duration of the pandemic. “However, the dedicated funding to house rough sleepers is set to run out and no clear plans or resources have been put in place by Government for what happens next.” They added: “When this crisis is over, we cannotto business as usual. If the Government is serious about its commitment to end rough sleeping, now is the time to act.” Labour has also called for focused support to get those with no recourse to public funds permanently off the streets, as well as changes to Local Housing Allowance and Housing Benefit. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “Councils should be proud of their efforts to get rough sleepers off the street, backed by an unprecedented continued package of government  support.

Pubs, restaurants and hotels have remained closed since shutting their doors in March, with vast numbers of staff supported by the Governmentaposs furlough scheme. In the guidance, hospitality businesses claried that they do not wish to move ahead with reopening before the time is right and support a phased reopening approach. The proposals for restaurants suggest that condiments would not be left on tables, with inidually wrapped sauces and condiments handed out by staff on request.  Restaurants would also need to bring cutlery with customersapos food, rather than leave them on tables or allow customers to help themselves. Tables would also be spaced in the restaurant to meet social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the guidance suggests that restrictions on customers remaining at the bar after ordering and getting their drink should be considered.  It also proposed that customers are discouraged from ing empty glasses, customers are told to keep a safe distance away from bar staff and they will have to form a socially-distanced queue for orders. Tape on the floor showing the appropriate distance needed and customers collecting drinks from a pick up point are also among the measures suggested. Pubs will also have to put in place a plan for toilets to ensure they donapost become overcrowded.  Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UKH, said: UKH is working hard with our members and alongside other industry bodies to develop practical and effective guidelines to enable businesses to begin to reopen safely when the time is right. These are draft guidelines that have been shared with governments in England, Scotland and Wales, to help inform their thinking around reopening. We hope that the guidelines will help businesses draw up their own plans based on their premises, ensuring that safety is at the forefront of operations when the right time comes to reopen. It comes as pub bosses took advantage of a loophole in the easing of lockdown rules to serve scorched Brits as temperatures soared to C yesterday. Thirsty punters shared photos of themselves enjoying pints in disposable cups across social media on Wednesday as landlords re-opened their boozers for takeaways only. Bar staff were snapped bringing drinks outside in full PPE while one pub in Bournemouth saw huge snaking queues of delighted customers. This weekaposs mini-heatwave peaked yesterday - smashing the hottest day of the year record set on Tuesday - with many Brits more desperate than ever to enjoy a pint after weeks in lockdown.

The Prime Minister yesterday pledged to have a “world-beating” track-and-trace system for Covid- in place by the end of the month. We have repeatedly seen ministers make ambitious promises then fail to deliver on them - we hope this will not be the case with contact tracing. There is a substantial and essential dference between having a system in place by June  and it being fully operational. Ministers need to come clean on whether the programme will be up and running in all parts of the country by this deadline and whether the army of , tracers is sufficient. Track-and-tracing is key to containing the virus and allowing the further lting of the lockdown. Which is why it is all the more scandalous that it has only been resuscitated now after being abandoned on March . Once again we see the Government playing catch-up as a result of its earlier misjudgments. It was too slow to provide protective kit, too slow to test for Covid and too slow to protect care home residents from the virus. It is not a pattern to be proud of.

Danielle Finlay Brookes was discovered dead on Tuesday night at her flat in an apartment block near the brash Punta Ballena strip. Local reports said she had been discovered leless inside a wardrobe at the property before police arrived after a concerned neighbour managed to get in. Police could not be reached early this morning for an official comment but it is understood Danielle’s death is not being treated as suspicious at this stage. Well-wishers have already donated nearly £, towards a GoFundMe appeal set up to raise money towards repatriation and funeral costs. One of the two expats who set up the fundraising site is Meghan Tattersall, who was badly hurt in a hate-fuelled hit-and-run in Magaluf in May  when she was mowed down by the ex-girlfriend of her new partner. Kemi Coaker, , from Manchester, was handed a two-year suspended jail sentence in May last year after confessing to running over Meghan, , from Leeds, after a plea bargain deal. Sales rep Meghan said in a Facebook tribute on Wednesday: “Your are my best friend and my angel high in the sky. I’m truly heartbroken. “I’m so proud to be able to spend everyday with you. Fly high my princess. RIP to my girl I’m so proud of. I love you.” [sic] Another pal, Jay Burton, said of the tragic expat, originally from Crewe, Cheshire: “Absolutely devastated to hear the news Danielle Finlay Brookes. “You were the le of the party everywhere you were. Hope you rest in peace. Magaluf won’t be the same without you.” He added in a later post: “Sending all my love to everyone  who is struggling through this tough time. “Being stuck indoors, with your mind doing somersaults, thinking you’re not good enough, with the biggest challenge of the day being putting a smile on your face.  “Thinking no-one would careyou just didn’t wake up the next day. “Today seeing all the support from the Maga family after losing an amazing girl who cared for everyone, makes me realise how le is too short and many people actually do care. “To all my friends and family, please check on those you haven’t heard from in a while.” Danielle, who described herself on social media as a “Queen building her own empire” had worked in Magaluf for several years. She is thought to have lived alone. She was described as a worker at the Three Lions Karaoke bar in October  when she filmed Spanish police hitting a female tourist as she tried to break up a fight between two men.  She wrote alongside the footage, which was posted on a Facebook page for Magaluf residents: “Spanish Guardia for you - attacking a girl for no reason.” She later wrote an impassioned statement about the incident, moaning Brits in the party resort were treated worse than muggers and prostitutes she claimed were “free to roam the streets.” Emotional pal Rob Dury said: “No words can describe how much all your friends and family will miss that smile. “A beautul young woman taken too soon. Thanks for being you. I will miss your hugs and chats.” The latest tragedy comes just less than a month after the death of another much-loved Magaluf bar worker, -year-old Irishman Anthony Ennis.  He plunged to his death from his eighth-floor apartment in the party resort just after am on April . Anthony, believed to be from Waterville, Co Kerry, worked at the well-known Stereo Bar in Magaluf. He was described as a “diamond of a bloke” by one friend after it emerged he had died. The results of an investigation into his death have not been made public but police are not understood to be treating the incident as a crime. Like Danielle, popular Anthony was gearing up for a much quieter season this year because of the coronavirus crisis. Brits normally make up most of the holidaymakers flocking to Magaluf and its raucous Punta Ballena party strip in the peak summer season months. But local tourism chiefs have predicted they could be outnumbered by other nationalities including Spaniards and Germans this yeara feared UK quarantine keeps them away.

Trade body Competent Roofer has warned tradespeople must be highly aware of the risks as lockdown is eased, which includes avoiding going inside peopleaposs properties as much as possible. It comes as the Government extended the hours builders could work in residential areas to pm Monday to Saturday to help get the industry going. But unions have warned that without legislation, some unscrupulous bosses could act against the interests of their staff. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Competent Roofer manager Tracie Hunter told The Sun : “Sadly you can’t invite tradespeople into your home for a cuppa.“But don’t stop coming up with other safe ways to show your appreciation.” Other measures include asking permission to use the toilet and always abiding by the two-metre rule. Tradespeople have also been told to avoid going into shops and to eat outside wherever possible, while sanitising their hands regularly.  On May  the Government set out a series of plans on reopening offices and businesses, with non-essential retailers slated to open from June. The construction and manufacturing industry was also encouraged toto work, with car makers announcing plans to restart factory lines. But there has been criticism of the lack of extra protections for workers after the Prime Minister called for employers to use common sense rather than enacting new legislation. The new rules fall under current safety legislation, overseen by the Health and Safety Executivewhich has received £ million in extra funding. Last week, the Government said all businesses would need to undergo an assessment to be labelled Covid- secure, running under current health and safety rules, rather than with the introduction of new laws for protecting workers. It said businesses that want to reopen will need to carry out an online risk assessment with the HSE and place the certicate on display. Rules include maintaining social distancing - with employers expected to redesign workspaces - staggering start times, creating one-way systems for workers and protecting staff who may be vulnerable.Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chairman and Labour MP Darren Jones has written to Business Secretary Alok Sharma also asking the department to lay out its plans for new powers to stop businesses from profiteering during the coronavirus crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"childrens hospice backed royal family","story":"NewsChildrens hospice backed by royal family shuts after £million coronavirus lossesEXCLUSIVE Sophie, Countess of Wessex, patron of Shooting Star Children’s Hospices, has been left “incredibly saddened” after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to close one of its two sitesShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSophie, Countess of Wessex, patron of Shooting Star Children’s Hospices \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex, patron of Shooting Star Children’s Hospices, has been left “incredibly saddened” after it shut one of two sites dedicated to helping  seriously ill kids. The charity, which has been visited by other senior royals including Prince Charles and Camilla, and the Duchess of Cambridge, offers emergency respite and end-of-le care. But a Mirror probe has discovered it is one of dozens of hospices, which rely on the public’s generosity, facing unprecedented hardship. Mass cancellations of fundraising events such as the London Marathon and the closure of high street charity shops have fuelled the crisis.Karen Sugarman, vice president of SSCH, which supports children in London and Surrey, said: “Covid- has had a devastating effect, like being run over by a massive steamroller. “Nobody could have been prepared for this. We are fighting with everything we have to be there for people who need us in their darkest hour.” Shooting Star was awarded £, in emergency government funding last month, but with services costing £, a day, Karen says it has “merely papered over the cracks”. She added: “The Government has been slow to react and there hasn’t been an adequate response.  “Sadly I don’t think we have ever been high enough on their agenda. “Charities around the world are suffering. We all have dferent needs but we are in this together.” The Mirror has been campaigning for the Government to double its funding to hospices to end the postcode lottery of hospice care, recruit more palliative care doctors and community nurses, and guarantee all terminally ill children receive end-of-le care. The closed facility, in Hampton, South West London, was visited by the Countess in February just weeks before the lockdown. Its ten child bedrooms and six family flats, normally full, will remain empty until funding is found. To raise awareness carers recorded a version of Miley Cyrus’ song The Climb, complete with sign language, which the singer plugged on Twitter. A Buckingham Palace source said the Countess “is closely following their situation and being kept regularly informed”. They added: “She was incredibly moved by a video they posted recently and she was incredibly sad to hear that they have had to close the Hampton hospice for now. “She is hugely passionate about the role they play in the children’s lives and she will continue to support them where she can in the coming months.”  The hospice has also been supported by music mogul Simon Cowell and Spandau Ballet frontman Tony Hadley, plus David Walliams. But with the situation desperate, Karen, who has been with the charity  years, raised £, this month by singing and playing the accordion live to her friends. She said: “I don’t play the accordion and I’m not a great singer but we are all doing what we can. “The Countess and our other supporters are with us as well and that means so much. We are in an unprecedented times and must raise money to keep the service going for children and families who rely on us.” She added: “We are extremely thankful for the rescue package but, for us and many others, this is merely papering over the cracks. “People assume we are funded by the NHS but... we are wholly reliant on the generosity of others.” Charles and Camilla officially opened the Hampton centre in , before Camilla invited some of the children to Clarence House to help decorate the Christmas tree. In , Kate – who is patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices –also visited the charity at its former base in Middlesex.  As part of its emergency response to the pandemic, the Government promised £million in grants to support hospices. But insiders say it is not enough and the care and support needed by a quarter of a million people every year hangs in the balance. Pop star turned campaigner Hadley said: “We really rely on public and corporate donations, which sadly have decreased during the pandemic, as people face their own financial uncertainties. “I know this is a dficult time for many, but any money you can donate would be so appreciated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first mass graves could dug","story":"NewsPlan to dig mass graves in UK to hold coffins of hundreds of coronavirus victimsOfficials in Aberdeenshire are drawing up the proposals to deal with a spike in deaths due to the coronavirus crisis following a similar move made by authorities in the United StatesShareCommentsByRichard PercivalNeil Murphy:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video coronavirus-death-toll-rises--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news first-mass-graves-could-dug-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Aberdeenshire Council is considering making them capable of holding hundreds of coffins as part of measures to deal with the Covid-. The planning covers Scotlandaposs north east coast after local council bosses said cremation and burial services could be overwhelmed. Latest figures from National Records Scotland show that only  people have died in the region from coronavirus with , dying in Scotland. Philip McKay, head of roads, landscapes and waste services at the council, said at a virtual council meeting that initially the regionaposs funeral industry looked bleak from initial forecasts. Officials in New York City, US have already started stacking wooden coffins next to each other in deep trenches on Hart island. It comes after the city experienced more than , deaths from Covid- last month causing morgues across the city to become overwhelmed. Mr McKay said: As part of that modelling there were ideas similar to New Yorkaposs approach, that we may have to open what effectively would be strip lairs. It is an absolutely draconian measure and one we didnapost take lightly and one we hoped we will never have to put in place. We were also considering the preemptive opening of lairs, which means the lair would be open before we had notication of the requirement for it.  The mass graves would be dug discreetly as officials added that it wouldnapost be appropriate to be done with members of the public present. Cllr Peter Argyle, chairman of Aberdeenshire Councilaposs infrastructure and services committee , said in a statement: The service has prepared for the worst case scenario and hopefully that will never be needed - but we need measures and plans in place. Academics also suggested that mass graves could be introduceddeath and bereavement services are inundated with bodies from the Covid- crisis. The experts from the University of Huddersfield believed it would spark a major increase in mortality rates.  Coupled with staff absences, the researchers say that this would lead to struggles issuing death certicates, a bottleneck in funeral services and overfilled mortuaries. Dr Julia Meaton, Dr Anna Williams and researcher Helen-Marie Kruger, authors of the paper, said: The impact of such an increase from normal levels will mean that the authorities will struggle to maintain death registrations and disposals that will potentially have serious consequences. Practically, not being able to register a death or obtain a death certicate will mean that disposal cannot take place. The authors continued: There will be a bottleneck of burials and cremations, causing ceremonies to be delayed with mortuaries filled beyond capacity. Families will be prevented from closing bank accounts, pensions, selling property or receiving insurance, which could have financial implications. Smaller plots, which are ten yards long and two yards wide, were previously created at Kemnal Park Cemetery in Chislehurst, London for members of the Islamic community.

Eddie Tierney was  when he had the op in  – and surgeons warned him the organ may last only five years. But  years later he is still going strong and yesterday welcomed a new law which means everyone in England is assumed to be an organ donor, unless they opt out. Max and Keira’s Law is named after Max Johnson, , of Winsford, Cheshire, and his heart donor Keira Ball, nine, who died in a car accident near her home in Barnstaple, Devon, in . The Mirror campaigned for four years to bring it to the statute book. Eddie lives in Wales, where the opt-out system has been in place since . “It is a good idea as far I’m concerned,” said Eddie, who lives with his we Phyllis, , near Rhyl, Denbighshire. “It means there is more chance of people getting a heart transplant than there was when I had mine.” Eddie, a former cabinet maker who later ran a second-hand shop, fell ill with a flu virus which attacked his heart. “I went in with the flu and the next thing I was told I had six weeks to live,” he said.  After a spell in Glan Clwyd Hospital in nearby Bodelwyddan he received a transplant at Harefield Hospital in West London. The operation was performed by world famous surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub. Eddie said: “I was his rd heart ­transplant at Harefield. He told me when I had it done that I should get five years.” One of the young doctors who cared for him initially in North Wales later became the Tierney family’s local GP. Dr David Whyler phoned Eddie last week to say happy birthday. Eddie said: “He told me he could never believe that I would get to . I’m still here. To be still here  years on, it’s just remarkable. I just can’t believe it.” Eddie later discovered his heart donor was a -year-old woman. And although he never met her family, he said: “I’m so grateful to them.” He still enjoys road trips on his two motorcycles and added: “I’m looking forward to getting out on my bike when the lockdown ends.” Eddie, who has a son, Michael, a daughter, Debbie, four grandchildren and a three-month-old great-grandson, Caleb, had to scrap a birthday party planned last Friday.

Troy House in Monmouth originates from the th century and the Grade II listed four storey dream home comes complete with a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, adding to an imposing portfolio of properties which also included Great Castle House in Monmouth and Badminton House in Gloucestershire. The estate was later converted into a convent school and then became a school, but as the condition of the buildings deteriorated the school moved locations in the s and the once grand manor has been left to rot.The , square-foot property has now been put up for auction, with a guide price of between £, and £, - but a look inside at just how dilapidated it has become suggests youaposll need far deeper pockets toit to its former glory.Listed by Allsop, it provides  bedrooms, four dormitories, a principalaposs flat, a staff flat, a caretakeraposs flat, a two storey hostel block, outbuildings and gargaing.The picturesque setting and grand exterior belie the true scale of the renovation job required, with photos of the interior showing floorboards and structures rotten through, with a huge clearance job needed to clear the abandoned school furniture. The description reads: The property is presented in a poor state of repair and requires extensive works of modernisation and refurbishment. The property may afford possible potential for redevelopment and or a number of alternative uses, subject to obtaining all necessary consents. If youaposre able to look beyond the current state of repair, the ultimate do-er upper does come with some incredible benefits, including sprawling land, original fittings and an estate that wouldnapost look out of place on Downton Abbey. Itaposs located a short journey from the historic market town of Monmouth, with both Cardf and Bristol city centres also accessible. With the Brecon Beacons National Park to the west and River Wye is to the east, you wonapost be short of idyllic viewsyou want a bit of a break from the DIY. Richard Adamson, partner and auctioneer at Allsop, said: Troy House has received a signicant amount of interest with over  enquiries regarding the property, in just over a week of coming to the market.

First Bus said drivers will do a head count using a device on ticket machines, closing doors and setting off when % capacity is reached. Passengers who make it on will be asked to sit a safe distance apart. Dave Lynch, of parent company FirstGroup, said: “We have been working round the clock to find ways to innovate so we can ensure safe, socially distanced space.” Stagecoach and Arriva want commuters to wear masks and sit by a window on their own unless with a family member – and keep seats in front and behind free. Passengers paying with cash must have the exact fare, as drivers will not give change to reduce the risk of infection. The Confederation of Passenger Transport said it was keeping people up to date “on how they can play their part to keep the bus network safe”.

But matches are due to take place behind closed doors when the season resumes. Mr Dowden said: “I think that creates an opportunity for us to be able to get some sport, some Premier League, free-to-air.” He added: “Those discussions are ongoing.”  Mr Dowden also offered hope for UK staycations, saying he’d “love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can”.

During the pandemic more than , rough sleepers have been offered emergency digs.  But the initial funding package is due to run out within weeks and ministers say getting them in longer-term accommodation is up to skint local authorities.

A poll of , adults saw the British staple of fried or grilled bacon sandwiched between two chunky slices of bread come out on top. Other popular fillings include cheese and pickle, chicken and bacon, and even a filling of crisps. The results show a sht in tastes, with a similar study from  seeing a plain cheese sandwich top the chart. This was followed by ham and cheese - which has now slipped to sixth place - with the nation favouring sausage, and egg mayonnaise two years on.  It also emerged that when it comes to preparing the perfect sandwich, aposwhite, medium sliced bread with the crusts left on and cut into squaresapos, is the top choice. A spokesman for Warburtons, which commissioned the  and  studies, said: However you prepare it, or whatever you fill it with, thereaposs something that canapost be beaten about a good old British sandwich. Itaposs interesting to see bacon top the list as weaposre all craving comforting, simple and hearty meals as social distancing continues. Itaposs also great to see Brits get more creative in the kitchen with jam and cheese, and even peanut butter and marmalade being used in the nationaposs sandwiches.  The combinations are endless so it comes as no surprise that bread is still one of the nationaposs favourite go-tos. The study also found itaposs not just sandwiches being enjoyed more by the nation, as a third of adults are eating more toasties now than they did before the lockdown, with cheese the most popular filling. And among the best loved condiments to enjoy with sandwiches were pickle , ketchupand mayonnaise . Others choose to spice up their sarnie with a splash of sriracha , a drop of tabascoor a spread of English mustard .  It also emerged almost half of those polled are eating more bread, while a third are enjoying more toast since the start of lockdown. The average person will enjoy four sandwiches and two toasties during a typical week - but a fth are currently tucking into more than seven sandwiches in a seven-day period. As a result, the average household is getting through two loaves of bread a week - with a quarter consuming more than three loaves in that time. Nearly a third Brits said the reason theyaposve had more bread is because they arenapost buying as many meals away from home, and  per cent put it down to having lots of other food in the house which goes well with it. Lunch is still the most popular time to enjoy a sarnie or toastie with  per cent doing so, while a quarter of Brits frequently indulge by snacking on a sandwich.  More than a third actually prefer sandwiches for lunch over a hot meal, and  per cent would even struggle to go a day without enjoying a slice of bread. However, people are no longer creatures of habit as  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, try to alternate their sandwich fillings, and one in  have been more experimental with fillings during lockdown. Some of the strange and unusual creations put together by the UK were also revealed with one respondent admitting to enjoying a chocolate spread and salami sandwich. Another confessed to eating a chocolate biscuit sandwich, with corned beef and peanut butter also among the inventive combinations.

Bars, cafes and restaurants have now been closed for almost  weeks - with many businesses being sadly crippled by the lack of business. However, when le s to something that looks a little more like normality, things could be far from normal when it comes to heading out on an evening. Drinking at the bar could become a thing of the past, so could mingling in crowds or even sitting near other diners, reports the Manchester Evening News. Last week, the Prime Minister revealed the governmentaposs plan in easing the strict restrictions, including when hospitality businesses can re-open. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here This is currently earmarked for no earlier than July  - but this completely depends on the five tests set out by the government being met which includes a consistent drop in Covid- cases. The ban of people drinking at the bar is one of many proposals being considered aimed at helping hospitality firms reopen. Restrictions on the number of children in outdoor playing areas and patrols of smoking areas have also been put forward among potential measures touted to help sites meet coronavirus guidelines. In the guidance, hospitality businesses have made it clear that they do not wish to move ahead with reopening before the time is right and support a phased reopening approach.  The proposals for restaurants suggest that condiments would not be left on tables, with inidually wrapped sauces and condiments handed out by staff on request. Restaurants would also need to bring cutlery with customersapos food, rather than leave them on tables or allow customers to help themselves. Tables would also be spaced in the restaurant to meet social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the guidance suggests that restrictions on customers remaining at the bar after ordering and getting their drink should be considered. It also proposed that customers are discouraged from ing empty glasses, customers are told to keep a safe distance away from bar staff and they will have to form a socially-distanced queue for orders.

And according to the experts, for most of us this is actually the right thing to doyou want a good night sleep. But for some people thereaposs a worrying side effect and it might mean you have to reconsider. According to the Sleeping Advisor the moving air causes flurries of dust and pollen. This can be bad news for people with allergies, asthma and hayfever. The dry air can also dry out our skin, so itaposs important to keep moisturising. It can also cause dry eyes which can make them irritable, especiallyyou wear contact lenses. If youaposre looking for an alternative there are a few other things you can try.  To cool down a room, try hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window. Bizarre, but it works. Closing the curtains during the day will also keep your room cooler, which will make it much nicer when it comes to bedtime. The right sheets are also key when it comes to keeping cool. Avoid satin and silk and stick to cooler linen and cotton sheets. Many people are also worried about how electricity their fan uses, and how much it costs to have it on all night. Experts from This Is Money say the answer to this depends on several factors - the kind of fan you have and the amount of energy it uses. You can find out how much energy yours is using by checking the wattage. The total cost will also depend on the amount of hours you use the fan for and the type of energy plan you have, as energy tarf prices y. From estimations, they were able to work out that the average cost of running a fan for  hours a night would be between p and p in total.

But as the days went on, it just felt like my lungs got smaller and smaller. Lucy had stayed with her housemates in Smithson, Liverpool to avoid spreading the virus to her parents back home. She had to tell her parents Helen Patterson,  and Michael Patterson, , about the seriousness of her condition over Facetime. She said: Before I was also in the aposuni canapost be over yetapos mentality and wanted to stay on with my flatmates and try and make lockdown fun - ironic.  It must have been very scary for my parents - I called them pretty much every day and they were just getting snippets of how I was progressing, whereas I was seeing it continuously. They saw me deteriorating with every call. I was so blase about it, so my family were much more concerned about me than I was. Lucy spent eight days on a ventilator, but admitted it wasnapost as scary as she had imagined. She now regrets not going to hospital sooner. I was definitely a part of that group before that was really blase about it. I do a science subject, so Iaposd seen the statistics for young people.  I was like, aposthe likelihood of me getting this, let alone it affecting me in any way is so small - I donapost need to worry.apos But when youaposre lying in that hospital bed, you donapost knowyouaposre going to be that .% thataposs going to be unlucky. I wasnapost improving for about five days, so it could have gone the other way for me. Everyone deserves help - just because someone is worse off than you, doesnapost mean that you need to save a hospital bed. If youaposre sick, youaposre helping the doctors more by going in early and getting checked, rather than trying to wait it out in your bed and then getting to the point youaposre so sick an ambulance has to come pick you up.

Instead of immediately rubbing the dry shampoo in, Cora leaves it to sit for like five or ten minutes. She encourages women to leave it in their hair while doing their make-up.  Then she rubs it in, making sure to spread it through evenly. After that she takes a hair brush and brushes it through her hair. And to finish she follows all of this up with a dry conditioner. She adds: And this goes against everything that Iaposve learned but my favourite dry shampoo in the world is Dove.

Shilpa Sethi, , from New Delhi, India, had always wanted a curvy body, so decided to start saving up k for a ‘Brazilian Butt Lt’.The model, who has over . million followers on her Instagram page where she posts X-rated pictures of herself in lingerie, said: I have always admired a curvy body. And I was very flat, at first.She added that despite her mum not wanting her to have the procedure, she went ahead with it anyway. But things did not go according to plan. Shilpa explained: I chose my doctor based on what I later discovered to be fake reviews. That first surgery was botched, and I had complications immediately after the procedure. I was short of breath, and felt a sharp pain in my leg. Unable to contact the Miami-based doctor directly, Shilpa did a little investigating and uncovered a culture of deception in the cosmetic surgery trade. His office staff members had bribed every patient in the office with free [pain relieving] Arnica cream for their fake review. The only reason I’m telling my story now is because I don’t want anybody  to go through what Iaposve been through. I wish I had never picked him as my first doctor. Shilpa is furious with the people who had written the  testimony. She said: People don’t care about other people as long as they get what they want from writing their fake review.  The end result of that surgery was not only a lopsided rear end, but considerable discomfort. It was very painful, and I wasn’t able to sit on my butt for four months. Now, following three more expensive and aposaggressively painfulapos corrective procedures costing a total of k – for which she travelled to Colombia twice and had to undergo a aposJ-plasmaapos to reattach loose skin back onto her muscles – Shilpa is finally able put this painful experience behind her. She also decided to treat herself to breast augmentation in the final cosmetic procedure.

My granddad got out of the hospital and he’s been battling Covid,” the -year-old said.“He’s had it for a while. It’s been a long process which started back in the beginning of March when he first started to feel ill.“He went in to the hospital for  days or so. I was still in Dundee so we had to FaceTime or Zoom call the family to keep updated on everything.“Thankfully, we were able to find some flights and get back over.“He’s healthy now which is great. It’s been great to see him recover and nice to be here with the family.“The challenge now is getting back over to Scotland but, thankfully, I’ve got a UK passport so I should be OK!”Harkes travelled back to the states with fiancée and Celtic Women’s player Sarah Teegarden a few weeks back.Their wedding plans are on hold and the country is in disarray but Harkes insists it’s nice to spend precious time with his loved ones.He continued: “She was able to come back as well which is good.“It’s nice to spend time together but all our wedding plans will be pushed back now.“On the mental side being back with them all helps tremendously, missing them throughout the year.“They came over around Christmas time but seeing them again six months later has been big. It always gives me a lt.“It’s a bit dferent here than the UK. Some things don’t seem so shut down but that’s just America right now – we’re not quite sure what’s going on.“It’s quite crazy just now with the amount of cases and, unfortunately, the amount of deaths we’ve had in America.“I think the country’s a little bit all over the place, some places are opening up and some are closed, but right now we’re still in lockdown in Virginia.“All the states are dferent but it’s been OK here.“I’m not sure how long that will be but we need to be safe, especially with having that experience in my family.“I think we’ve all had a little bit of a dferent view towards it but we’ll see how it goes and hope for the best.“We can still exercise and things like that. I’ve had space to go and run and cycle, do some things in the yard and touch a ball every day.“It’s been good to have certain resources back home and to keep doing stuff.”Like most, lockdown has been a test for Harkes’ mentally and physically. For him, it’s a challenge he soon hopes to rise to on the pitch.Harkes added: “It’s definitely been a challenge on both sides but, thankfully, the club provided us with a great fitness programme before we went on furlough to keep us ticking over.“I’ve been active and all of us want to be flying when we finally get the go-ahead to get back to playing.“We’re all trying to push each other and push ourselves.“On the mental side, the way we ended was a little tough because we wanted to play for the fans and finish out the season.“We really felt like we deserved the title and we knew it then but we just wanted to finish off the games and prove it to everyone.“We’ll have that desire to get back on the pitch and play hard when we finally get it going.”The United support have taken to Harkes since he joined the club in January last year, as much for his flowing locks as his skill on the pitch.He is pleased to inform them nothing has changed on the hair front in lockdown but that he might soon be forced to take matters into his own hands.“I’m still going strong but it will be cut before everything gets going again,” Harkes said.“I think it’s getting a bit ridiculous now.“I don’t want to start putting it up in a bun and everything.

However, I’m getting the sneaking feeling now just isn’t the right time.That might come as a surprise to people who have read this column over the past few weeks andIt seems like we are slowly moving toward the game eventually restarting.Yesterday’s announcement of the Premiership being called with Celtic champions and Hearts relegated came as no surprise.There was no other credible option.The Jambos will, obviously, feel aggrieved and so will some Rangers fans but it is the right call.I said from the start of the shutdown that reconstruction is the only way to ensure no club is unduly affected by leagues ending early.And I still stand by that.However, the situation we are in now a couple of months down the line leads me to pause for thought.Clubs are in such dire straits right now, nobody really knows how many might go to the wall before the game restarts.If we’ve already agreed reconstruction and, say, five clubs go under, we have to start the whole process over again.The decision-makers in the game have shown over the past few farcical weeks that there’s a realI can see where the Premiership clubs were coming from when they canned the revamp talks  days ago.It looks like a mammoth job to get football back on the pitch sometime soon, eventhe SPFL are planning to restart again in July.With that in mind, I’d prefer reconstruction talks were put on the back burner – not binned, by any means – and talked about in a measured fashion over the next few months.Start the new season as normal – eventhings have to wait a few weeks to get the green light – and then get a plan in place for the season after.That way, the new set-up comes from a foundation of stability rather than the uncertainty the game is surrounded by right now and what the future might hold.At the very least, clubs can now plan for the season ahead, knowing who they will be facing eventhere are still doubts around.The big thing for all clubs is getting that stability back, that certainty to then plan ahead.It feels like that’s coming – once it’s back, start talking reconstruction to improve our game in the long-term.I felt for a couple of my old team-mates who were released by their clubs over the weekend.The coronavirus pandemic is obviously a dficult time for everybody but being without a job through it is horrible.Particularly when there’s no prospect right now of finding another employer.With football clubs unable to make moves in the transfer market because of the shutdown, that leaves players like Danny Swanson and Craig Conway in limbo.Normally, I’d expect them to have plenty of offers to think over this summer.Swansonis one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen in training.He was superb at Tannadice.He obviously hasn’t played so much at St Johnstone for whatever reason, leading to his departure.Conway, meanwhile, has had a really successful career since leaving United.He was always such a fit guy and a great lad to have in the dressing-room, he’d normally find a new club no problem.Right now, though, nobody knows what will happen.I was pleased to see Dundee say they were extending some contracts.Christie Elliott’s for another year, a clause he had in his deal, and Paul McGowan, Josh Meekings and Tom Field till July. Even though that’s just a few weeks, it sends the right message – that they are going to look after players.I don’t imagine every club will be doing that.A lot of players will have a stressful summer coming up with no club able to sign them.Theof football with the Bundesliga starting at the weekend was very much a step in the right direction for me.It might have been a bit strange without the crowds but needs must.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity. What is yours Already safety rules for the bug are being set by my children. Number one rule: dad must never sit on it, but he can pull it.The term rod for my own back comes to mind."},{"url":null,"title":"co-op-customers-east-lothian-help-raise-20-000-local-causes","story":"A

the whales from the beach.Word soon spread across East Lothian and beyond, and the scene attracted large crowds of people.In , Dr Herring told the Courier: ldquoWhile this was a tragedy for the whales, which all died or were shot by the RSPCA, it can also be seen as a social occasion where many people gathered.ldquoI interviewed a number of those who went to see the whales and what they told me reveals much about society in , and how dferent it was to today.The headlines in the Haddingtonshire Courier ndash as the paper was then called ndash of May , , were: WHALES STRANDED NEAR DUNBAR, THORNTONLOCH BEACH SCENES, DISPOSAL OF CARCASES.The paper reported: ldquoThousands of sightseers from the Lothians and the North of England visited Thorntonloch Bay on Sunday, to view the  whales which stranded on the beach about .am the previous day.ldquoThe traffic on the roads leading to Thorntonloch was the heaviest seen in East Lothian for many years, hundreds of vehicles, including specially chartered buses, being parked on the highway and the side roads from Skateraw to Dunglass Bridge, a distance of about two and a half miles.This amount of traffic was unheard of in , as few people had access to a car and a very small minority owned one.In his book, Dr Herring quotes two men who were boys at the time and who told the author that seeing all the cars was even more exciting than seeing the whales.It will seem strange to younger people today that, in , most of the population of Britain saw travelling in a car as something you did when going to a wedding or a funeral.Dr Herring was given many photos by people who contacted him after an article seeking help was published in the Courier in .One was sent to the author by Sandy Darling, then aged , who now lives in Musselburgh.Sandy, who had cycled out to Thorntonloch from Stenton, is shown in the photo watching over the scene.What is interesting in this photo is how well-dressed people are.In the s, people of all classes would dress much more formally than today when going somewhere which would involve meeting other people.There was also little attention paid to health and safety in .In a photo from the now defunct Illustrated London News, the people are standing right next to the dead and dying whales.If this tragedy happened today, the public would be kept well away.Dr Herringrsquos book contains many recollections of people who stood next to ndash and in some cases on ndash the whales. ndashThey remembered the poignancy of the scene the late Jean Budge said: ldquoIt was terribly sad ndash all these beautul creatures dying on the beach.Many also remembered it as an amazing scene and Ian Porteous recalled: ldquoIt was a spectacular scene with all these black whales on the beach.This highlights the fact there was no television in Scotland until  ndash and the internet was another  years away. People had never seen whales before, except in books.Dr Herring is still collecting peoplersquos memories of the whale stranding, which remains one of the major East Lothian events of the past  years.

The test looks for antibodies which could help indicate whether a person has developed some immunity against the virus.As it is able to detect  per cent of cases where a person has had coronavirus in the past, the test could prove useful in helping to inform when lockdown restrictions may be safe to ease.The Department of Health and Social Caresaid it is exploring the use of antibody testing across the NHS in England, and later the wider public.DHSC said it was delighted that devices were progressing through validation and is working on plans to roll out antibody testing, adding that an announcement will be made ldquoin due course.Health officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions about testing, but are likely to roll out the antibody testEngland adopts it."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-testing-site-operating-former-power-station","story":"Army personnel can be seen carrying out tests while wearing masks as they welcome key workers and family members who received appointments to attend.The mobile unit is using the former Cockenzie Power Station site as one of several bases across Scotland which it will visit as additional testing is carried out by the UK Government.It opened yesterday with a \"Covid Testing\" sign at the entrance to the site.Imagesshow a team of military staff on the site carrying out testing through vehicle windows at the drive through centre.The st Infantry Brigade, which oversees army reserves in Scotland, are running the mobile unit.The mobile units are providing additional testing capacity to the NHS which continues to focus on testing hospital and social care workers.It is hoped the mobile units will be able to offer tests to other key workers and their families from a wider range of identied essential services including those working in the third sector and volunteer care helpers.The unit willto Cockenzie in two weeks time as part of the national testing programme"},{"url":null,"title":"leuchie-house-toasts-superb-inspection-results","story":"Following an unannounced inspection in January, the Care Inspectorate awarded Leuchie House the highest possible score in four categories and the second highest in a fth.The categories were: quality of care and support quality of staffing quality of leadership how well peoplersquos wellbeing is supported and quality of setting.The report said: ldquoGuests experienced respectful and compassionate care at each stage of their interaction with the service.

the real reason why its aircraft have been seen across Scotland.The most noticeable planes to have been spotted recently launched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.These large aircraft have been observed circling Glasgow as well as making brief landings during \"touch and go\" manoeuvres designed to practice these tricky and sometimes risky touchdowns.In wartime, some planes have to make landings on rough terrain, so its imperative that pilots are as well-practised as possible.\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is an Airbus AM Atlas, the type of airfact seen over Glasgow in recent weeks \" class\"editor-image\"This is an Airbus AM Atlas, the type of airfact seen over Glasgow in recent weeks A spokesman for RAF Lossiemouth told The Herald:\"Due to the lockdown, the public have become more aware and interested in these activities.\"To be clear, these were all occurring prior to the pandemic. But a lack of civil aviation now makes them stand out more.\"Many of the larger aircraft based out of RAF Brize Norton, such as the C- Hercules, AM Atlas, A-MRTT Voyager, and C- Globemaster regularly fly on essential, but routine training missions around the United Kingdom.\"The C- and A in particular fly quite low-level profiles, and on operations they will be used to land in areas where there are not established runway surfaces.\"This can include landing on beaches, for example.\"The quiet skies have made it easier to spot military planes, which can sometimes be identied and followed using apps like FlightRadar.Occasionally, the military planes have been observed performing strange-looking manoeuvres such as flying around in circles .The RAF said these odd flight patterns have a clear explanation: the aircraft were involved in mid-air refuelling.For the last three weeks RAF Lossiemouth has been involved in night flying exercise which concluded on Friday, May  involving Typhoon jets.\"During our night flying window, we launched our first set of sorties around ,\" the spokesman added.\"This meant we were able to generate two or three training serials a day ndash two in daylight, and one in low-light conditions.\"The Typhoon is a multi-role aircraft, which means itrsquos able to conduct a number of dferent missions while in the air air-to-air and air-to-ground manoeuvres to name two.\"To enable our Typhoons to stay on task for longer and travel larger distances, we are often supported by Voyagers ndash the RAFrsquos air-to-air refuelling aircraft based at RAF Brize Norton.\"These Voyager aircraft will fly lsquoracetracks in the skyrsquo, and are usually visible on flight tracking websites which pick up ADS-B.\"In the United Kingdom, live-armed Typhoons are on \"constant standby to react against unidentied aircraft approaching UK airspace as well as aircraft that are operating in an unusual manner, which may pose a threat\".Typhoons are often scrambled on \"Quick Reaction Alert\" missions to intercept planes which enter British airspace\"Our last intercept was against two Bear-F ndash Russian Maritime Patrol Aircraft on April ,\" the spokesman said.\"Additionally the Typhoon Force are involved in NATO Air Policing missions, such as Op AZOTIZE in Lithuania where  Squadron deployed a few weeks ago.\"Typhoons have also been involved in strikes against Daesh.\"A Typhoon jetIf youre worried by the sudden appearance of a military aeroplane, you can generally find out what its up to by visiting offical Twitter accounts or the RAF website.\"The RAF has always been open about its operations and exercises,\" the spokesman continued.\"With the public now spending more time at home, many have taken to their gardens or spent more time on their phones.\"They have also become more acutely aware of the noises above their houses, and wersquove seen a signicant increase in interest in routine, but essential flying as a result.\"When we do launch Quick Reaction Alert, wherever possible we publish information as to who we intercepted, what the aircraft were doing, why the interception was carried out, roughly where it all happened, and we aim to answer as many questions we can whilst maintaining operational security.\"Itrsquos vital that the public understand why this activity is essential to the defence of the

A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

At the most fundamental level dogs give us something to live for, something to get out of bed for. They love us evenwe donrsquot love ourselves. They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed. Yet, as wersquoll soon see, itrsquos a crucial network that keeps the country running.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

away from areas that would typically be popular, according to results from a national footfall experiment.Environmental technology company Wilderness Sensors placed internetconnected counters at locations including paths not far from its headquarters in Stewarton, East Ayrshire, and a number of Historic Environment Scotlandunmanned properties.Among them was a section of the Antonine Wall near Bonnybridge, near Falkirk.The technology is designed to provide information on levels of use and demand, and help communities plan services for visitors.But it has also shone a light on striking shts in leisure habits since the start of the pandemic.Before lockdown, the counter in Stewarton picked up an average of about  people per day taking in a local river stroll.The same device has since detected a four-fold increase in walkers, with up to  each day.Similarly, sensors at the Antonine Wall have registered a steady increase in visits following the introduction of Covid- travel restrictions and amid concern over health risks posed by crowded places.In January and February, they picked up around , people, rising to nearly , in March.However, by April, the figure had jumped to ,, with the figure for May projected to be more than ,.The surge has prompted HES experts to stress that monitoring visitor pressure at some sites will be of crucial importance during lockdown.Alistair Carty, technical director at Wilderness Sensors, said: ldquoWe have had a counter on the Stewarton river walk for a long time, counting the number of people who take a walk along the river.ldquoNormally, it picks up a few dozen people every day ndash but we have seen a real usage pattern sht.ldquoStewarton is a commuter town and, as a result of lockdown, there are probably a lot of people who are re-discovering what their local area has to offer, making the walk part of their daily routine.Mr Carty said data changes at the Antonine Wall ndash a turf fortication built by the Romans across what later became Scotlandrsquos Central Belt ndash were also dramatic.ldquoThe counters... are part of an ongoing programme of deployments across Historic Environment Scotlandrsquos unmanned sites, he said.ldquoThey are designed to help the organisation understand how these places are being used and where interventions may be required ndash for example,there are a lot of visitors at the site, a member of staff might need to be there too.ldquoThe Antonine Wall site at Rough Castle is a big open space, so it can handle the increasing number of people walking there while social distancing guidelines are in place.ldquoInterestingly, footfall has become more pronounced at the weekend, rather than evenly spread across the week.ldquoWe interpret that as the reduced numbers of professional dog walkers that would use the site on weekdays.ldquoBut, overall, the site is considerably busier and now follows a more traditional lsquovisitorrsquo pattern.ldquoInevitably, there is an element of seasonality to the numbers but that only explains part of it.ldquoThe change in visitors has been stark and the fact it is not only the weekends shows lockdown has had a signicant effect on peoplersquos habits.ldquoIt is making people look to their local area and heritage sites, perhaps re-discovering these places or taking them in for the first time.However, the trend, while indicating broad levels of compliance with Scotlandrsquos coronavirus restrictions, is likely to create challenges given the possible impact on historic locations.Nick Thomas, head of commercial performance  systems at HES, said: ldquoMonitoring our unstaffed properties will be of particular importance during this current period of restricted movement and beyond.ldquoWith visitors likely to favour less populated and open sites in the coming months we will need to be aware of the potential pressures that this generates.ldquoThe Wilderness Sensors are an important tool in this remote monitoring process across our erse estate.Counters have also been deployed on the West Highland Way in partnership with Stirling Council, Gartness Community Group and CENSIS ndash Scotlandrsquos centre of excellence for sensor and imaging systems, and the Internet of Things .Although the devices have only just been installed, they are expected to show relatively low footfall compared to what would normally be anticipated at this time of year, in a sign that many people are avoiding popular visitor sites.The initiative follows a recent FutureTech seminar held by CENSIS at Loch Lomond and The Trossachs Country Park headquarters in Balloch.This was part of a wider programme of business support commissioned by the Scottish Government to explore the use of IoT, which refers to the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive information.Rachael Wakefield, business development manager at CENSIS, said: ldquoOne of the main aims of the [West Highland Way] project is to provide a boost to the local economy, by helping businesses plan ahead for staffing, stock, and opening hours using visitor data.ldquoHowever, the outbreak of Covid- and the subsequent lockdown has brought an unexpected element, in which we are observing just how quiet the route is in late spring ndash normally one of the most popular times of the year to attempt the walk.ldquoAlongside the footfall counters, we plan to install other sensor systems to monitor iables such as weather conditions and river levels, and so we still expect to see some interesting data from this stage of the project.ldquoIt is a great example of how sensors and IoT technologies can be used to better understand how visitors are interacting with Scotlandrsquos heritage and help local businesses, which depend on tourists, to more efficiently plan.Evidence that increasing numbers of people in Scotland are being drawn to sites and landmarks close to their homes comes as ministers prepare for an expected surge in staycations once lockdown is eased.Last week, Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ldquoWith the unlikely event of aviation as we knew it resuming soon or possibly even by next spring, staycations, I think, will be extremely popular.ldquoWe have to consider and we have to manage the foreseeable scenario where the first weekend, the road from east Loch Lomond, from Drymen to Ben Lomond, is jam-packed because everybody goes to the most popular area. We have to think about that as well, and these practical issues ndash the provision of public toilets and lavatories and other services ndash all these things we need to plan in advance."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-neil-mackay-coronavirus-proves-ordinary-people-played-fools-time-rein-rich-tame-politicians","story":"Meanwhile, the author Neil Gaiman ndash personal wealth pound million ndash can fly from New Zealand to Scotland via LA and London to break lockdown in Skye, because he needs time away from his we.I donrsquot often feel rage ndash itrsquos a bad, ugly emotion ndash but the disparity between the rich and the poor thatrsquos on show during the coronavirus pandemic makes it hard to keep burning anger in check.As I write, news is breaking that Rolls-Royceis to cut  jobs.

What happened was that, during a News at Ten programme, Ms Smith said Nicola Sturgeon had ldquoenjoyed the opportunity to set out her own lockdown rules and not have to follow whatrsquos happening in England and other parts of the UK.But the First Minister took umbrage at this. ldquoNever in my entire political career have I lsquoenjoyedrsquo anything less than this, she said. ldquoMy heart breaks every day for all those who have lost loved ones to this virus. Which prompted Ms Smith to try to clary things: ldquoI had meant to say hellip she has lsquoembracedrsquo the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyedrsquo by mistake.Now, I have no idea what Ms Smithrsquos political opinions are, but there are a few things worth saying about the original news report and the First Ministerrsquos response to it because they reveal quite a bit about the BBC, the SNP, and the relationship between politics and journalism.First, the news report. The problem with reports of this kind in which broadcasters are asked to analyse the dayrsquos events is that theyrsquore trying to do an almost impossible job: analyse whatrsquos going on while appearing to be totally factual and unbiased: in other words, express an opinion without appearing to express an opinion.But the premise is flawed. Sarah Smith. Me. You. We are not unbiased. As soon as a journalist decides to cover one story or another ndash or use one word or another ndash they are being influenced by unconscious bias. Ms Smith was also self-evidently not giving us untainted facts, she was expressing an opinion and it would helpthe BBC used the right word for it ndash opinion ndash and stopped acting, in its rather hoighty-toighty way, like itrsquos completely unbiased. It isnrsquot: it seeks to control bias, which is a totally dferent thing.But as well as defending Sarah Smith, Irsquod also like to make an appeal to the First Minister here, because her response leaves a lot to be desired. First, her tweet was doing a thing that journalists get a lot: responding with how-dare-you horror to something you havenrsquot actually said. Ms Smith was suggesting the First Minister was enjoying, or embracing, the political elements of the crisis, not the personal consequences for the victims, and it was unfair of Ms Sturgeon to suggest otherwise with talk of loved ones and broken hearts.Ms Sturgeon also needs to be careful about the pot she stirs. I was talking to a colleague recently who told me that hersquod been seeing a therapist because of the vilication and mockery hersquod received from SNP supporters, including ministers, and the effect that it had on his self-confidence. You might say: \"If you dish it out, you gotta take it\", but all I would say to senior SNP politicians, including the First Minister, is: before you single out a journalist, take a look behind you at the snarly hordes you are about to unleash and encourage.The other problem with tweets like the First Ministerrsquos is that they encourage something  thatrsquos troubling: a belief among some of her supporters that the BBC is institutionally anti-independence. The BBC is like any other large organisation in Scotland: there are people in it who believe in independence and there are people who donrsquot, and it does at least have rules that seek impartiality. But, in tweet after tweet, its critics accuse it of being anti-independence and the result is what psychologists call an availability cascade: a belief that grows because of the number of people saying it.The cascade also has another curious effect. SNP supporters who believe the BBC is biased against independence have boycotted its coverage. For them, this preserves the cascade, but the problem for the BBC is that other viewers ndash unionists, left-wingers, right-wingers ndash are doing the same thing for dferent reasons.Which leads us back to poor Sarah Smith standing there with a microphone trying to navigate it all and appear neutral. What shersquos saying to us is: ldquoTrust me, Irsquom a journalist ndash a neutral, unbiased BBC journalist. But perhaps the BBC could be more honest about whatrsquos really going on: she is expressing an opinion. And perhaps, when she hears the opinion, the First Minister could try to be a little less touchy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It frees up your time, so you can binge Netflix after dinner instead of standing by the sink up to your elbows in greasy dishwater. Besides, dishwashers do a better job washing dishes than you can possibly do by hand. Butyou really want clean dishes, you have to stop making these common mistakes.. Pre-washingIts pointless to pre-wash dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. Stop doing this. Its a waste of time. Credit: Getty Images   RyanJLanePre-washing your dishes is a pointless waste of time and water. Plus, yoursquoll get better resultsyou leave some dirt for the detergent to work on. So, donrsquot wash before you wash. Even the stickiest, dirtiest plates can come out cleanyou just scrape them first.. Blocking the sprayThe cardinal sin of dishwashing is blocking the water spray. If you do that, theres no point in running the dishwasher, because your dishes wont get clean. Credit: Reviewed   Jonathan ChanThe cardinal rule of loading the dishwashermdashdonrsquot block the water jets. If you put a big platter or baking sheet in the way of the spray arm, the rest of the dishes will not get clean. Remember, the big items go on the sides. If yoursquove got a deep roasting pan to clean, remove the cutlery basket, and seeyou can fit the pan into the space. You can wash the cutlery in the next load.. Letting spoons ldquospoonWhat your spoons do on their own time is up to them. What they do in your dishwasher is up to you. Credit: Reviewed   Jonathan ChanSpeaking of cutlery, do not let it nestle together in the basket. If the spray cant get to the surfaces, youll be unloading dirty forks and spoons. If you have a basket with a grid, use the slots to separate each piece. If itrsquos an open basket, load it so that some utensils point up, and some points down.Use the third rackyou have onemdashit keeps cutlery from getting too close.. OverloadingThis dishwasher looks like its already full, but the owner cant resist adding another bowl. Dont do thisyou want your dishes to get clean. Credit: Getty Images   CasarsaGuruOvercrowding the dishwasher makes it hard for it to get your dishes clean. The water has to be able to reach every surface. I know how it feels to see those last few filthy dishes in the sink, and really wishing there was room for them. But its better to wash the last couple of plates by hand or save them for the next load.. Skipping rinse aidIf your glasses have water spots, just use rinse aid the next time. Credit: ReviewedMaybe you would remember to pour in rinse aidit were called ldquodry aid. Modern dishwashers dry using hot water, not hot air. Rinse Aid helps water sheet off the tub and the dishes, so it goes down the drain. Less water ends up on your dishes. If youre seeing spots on your glasses, youre probably not using rinse aid.. Neglecting to clean the filterReach in, remove the filter, and wash it. You can even scrub food off it with a soft toothbrush, but be gentle. While youve got your head in the dishwasher, use a skewer or toothpick to clean debris out of the water jets. Credit: ReviewedIf you donrsquot clean the filter, from time to time, your ldquoclean dishes can feel gritty and end up covered with tiny food particles. So, periodically reach under the spray arm and remove the filter. Soak it in warm, soapy water for a few minutes, go over it with a toothbrush , then rinse it under the tap. Plug it back into the dishwasher, and while yoursquore down there, use a skewer to push out any gunk thatrsquos clogging up the jets on the spray arm.. Allowing food to dry on the platesIts hard for your dishwasher to remove dried-on foodmdashand spinach is the worst. If you cant run a full normal cycle right away, at least start a rinse cycle. Credit: Reviewed   Jonathan ChanIts hard for your dishwasher to remove dried-on foodmdashand spinach is the worst. If you cant run a full normal cycle right away, at least start a rinse cycle.If you have to walk away without starting a full cycle use the rinse cycle to hold down disgusting odours and keep food from drying on the plates. Yoursquoll be glad you did.. Loading things in that arent dishwasher safeSome things should never go in the dishwasher. Dont even think of loading cast iron pans, wooden spoons, or anything that isnt labelled as dishwasher safe. Credit: Getty Images   K_ThalhoferYou can wash a few things that arenrsquot dishes in your machine. Ive heard of everything from hubcaps to hairbrushes! But some things you should never consider washing in the dishwasher are cast iron or aluminium pans, wooden spoons and cutting boards, your good kitchen knives, or plastic takeaway containers. To be on the safe side, avoid putting in anything that isnt labelled ldquodishwasher safe..

The Orcadian is awaiting clarication on how this will be put into practice in Orkney.Speaking about the enhancement of key worker testing, NHSO chief executive designate, Iain Stewart said: “Testing will be undertaken at the COVID- Assessment Centre with results being available within hours rather than days.#Currently our laboratory continues to provide a clinical service and the health board is confident at this time that demand for COVID- testing can be met and will be managed daily. However, it may be necessary on occasions to prioritise other cohorts such as those in Group One when demand for testing exceeds capacity”.   If you are a key worker, and you or a family member is symptomatic of COVID- — a fever or a new and persistent cough for more than half a day, or a change in your sense of taste or smell — you may be eligible for COVID- testing. You can see the full list of keyworkers and their priority categories in Scotland by clicking here.Sara Lewis, consultant in public health at NHS Orkney added: “The testing process will not include a health assessment. It is recommended thatyou are displaying symptoms of COVID- you should visit the NHS Inform website in the first instance or contact NHSto seeyour symptoms are consistent with COVID- infection“If NHS advise symptoms are consistent with COVID- and home isolation is required you should contact your employer to obtain a copy of the testing referral form. A copy of the form can  be requested by visiting NHS Orkney’s website or emailing HighlandIslandMailKirkwall@scotland.pnn.police.uk ”.“Completed testing forms should be emailed from an employee’s line manager or human resources deparment representative, where available, but in any case providing verication that they’re absence from work, on account of self-isolating, is preventing their respective organisation from operating and providing an essential service in Orkney. #Forms should be emailed to the gateway address of HighlandIslandMailKirkwall@scotland.pnn.police.uk which is co-ordinating the testing service on behalf of Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordinating Groupwith the exception of Orkney Islands Council employees or health and social care workers who should continue to access COVID- testing through the process currently in place.“On receipt of the referral the testing centre will contact you or your household member to offer an invite for testing. Test results should be available on the same day as testing, iniduals will be contacted by the COVID- Assessment Centre who will confirm the test results with the inidual and their employer. Test results of household members will be anonymised in line with Scottish Government guidance.“Any iniduals found to have a positive COVID- test result this will be reported to their line manager, their GP and NHS Orkney’s Public Health Department for follow up”OLECG chairman, Chief Inspector Matt Webb said: “We would like to thank all the keyworkers who continue to work so hard to ensure services continue, enabling us to safeguard and protect the residents of Orkney.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme.

For those isles without shops, residents will receive a direct payment instead.“Our aim is to recognise the vital role isles shops play at the heart of their communities – and to provide some support for the residents they serve,” said James Stockan, Council Leader and Councillor for Stromness and the South Isles.“There’s been positive feedback from many folk in the isles over recent weeks and I hope this extension to the scheme will be welcomed.”The cost of the vouchers over the eight-weeks period will be approximately £,, which will slightly exceed the £, Food Fund funding allocation the Council received from the Scottish Government.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are having to limit the recycling collections to single green bins each week.#So we would ask people to remain patient and,they cannot fit all their weekly items in a single bin, to continue storing some for future collections.”Green recycling bins and boxes should be put out on your usual bin day. You should remove the caddies inside — and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as the council will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis — again on your usual collection day.Councillor Drever added: “We’ve tried to make the arrangements as straight forward as possible.“You’ll be putting a green bin or box out weekly — and a grey bin or red bags once a fortnight. The thing to remember is to do this on the day of the week when your bins would normally be collected.“We will be using a mix of waste and recycling vehicles to help us clear the backlog, with all materials collected to be sent for recycling.”The recycling collections will take place as follows:Meanwhile, the council is currently developing plans for the partial re-opening of some Household Waste Recycling Centres in June, in line with the recent announcement by the local government organisation, COSLA, and subject to further guidance from the Scottish Government.The possibility of resuming recycling collections in Westray and Shapinsay and re-opening isles recycling points is also being looked at.More information will be provided soon.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters.

This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

He won a scholarship to Foyle College, where he excelled academically and captained the First XV rugby side. From Foyle College he won a place at Queens University a year early where he studied classics and, of course, played rugby. He taught at Royal School, Armagh andalso played for Armagh RFC.While in Armagh he married Sylvia. First and only Boys’ PrincipalHe went on to become the first, and only, headmaster of Cambridge House Boys’ Grammar School. He retired when the Boys’ and Girls’ schools merged, leaving the former with a very good reputation.Bill didn’t sit still in retirement, and worked in developing and assessing prospective headmasters all over the Province and ended up good friends with many of them. Many thought of Bill as their mentor. Bill, who enjoyed golf, also dedicated a huge amount of time to Ballymena Rugby Football Club.He was Chairman during the - season. The Board of Directors of Ballymena RFC, on behalf of everyone connected with the club, recently extended their sincere condolences to all who mourn Bill’s passing.

Duane Farrell, CEO of relationship counselling service Relate NI, has said anxieties around money, childcare and living space are all putting stress on couples and households as lockdown continues. He said as traditional forms of support for households, such as receiving health visitors, fall away, families are looking for support for their relationships. Speaking to the BelfastCoronavirus podcast, he said: Our relationships are an essential part of our health and our wellbeing at this time, and sometimes when there are challenges, that can also affect our health and wellbeing. It#s a perfect storm that households are experiencing at the moment - increases in worries about finances as people are furloughed or let go from their jobs, really close proximity, people will have a whole host of things that take up their week and they have all disappeared.It#s led to people relying much more on other family members for support - which can sometimes expose cracks in relationships, he said.

Any existing tensions that there are in a relationship are being brought sharply into focus during lockdown in these last two months, even where relationships have previously been really strong. There are new challenges being faced because of the pressure people are under. Tensions will be exacerbated but even stronger relationships will face tests.Mr Farrell said couples and families are advised by Relate NI to keep lines of communication open.

Taking that time out to communicate clearly and family members listening and responding as much as possible, he said.

You#re trying to take out those opportunities for conflict. Perhaps the dining room table is used by children in the morning for school work and it#s used by mum and dad for other things in the afternoon.The PSNI have reported an increase in incidents of domestic violence in recent weeks.

Fundraising has been decimated and most are not eligible to apply for government-backed support schemes.We are looking at the collapse of some of the most loved, taken-for-granted charities. We can#t take them for granted any more, Ms Smith told the Stormont Communities Committee yesterday. We are now into week nine of lockdown and charities are existing on severely depleted funds, with many workers on furlough. This is happening at a time when demand for services is greater than normal.We are looking at an eye-watering amount of money that has been lost. The financial impact has been devastating and without support in the long term we#re going to see the withdrawal of many key services people have been relying on.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £m of support for charities in April, with £m allocated to charities here. Some £.m was allocated to hospices and Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the rest would form a Covid- Charities Fund.A £.m fund will not solve the crisis in our sector but there are other solutions available that would help protect cash flow, Ms Smith said. Making slight changes to the law to allow furloughed charity employees to come back and work in a volunteering capacity would not cost any more money to the public purse, but it would ensure that charity services can keep going and support people who need them.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit:Steve Parsons PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA person on the NHS coronavirus contact tracing app, which Isle of Wight residents have been trialling. Credit:Steve Parsons PA WireMark BainTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA contact tracing programme involving all confirmed positive cases of Covid- has started in Northern Ireland.The region has become the first of the four devolved nations to launch the plan, with all new positive cases now being traced.Finding all the people someone has been in contact with once they have tested positive for Covid- is seen as a key part in preventing the spread of the disease, according to the Public Health Agency .“This is another example of the herculean work right across the HSC system to fight back against Covid- and keep people safe,” said Health Minister Robin Swann.“The battle against the virus is a long-term challenge and contact tracing will have a very important role as part of that.”Dr Jackie Hyland, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA, said contact tracing at this stage involves new ways of working given the scale and the fact that new evidence is continually emerging about the illness.“We have teamed up with colleagues in the university sector and Health and Social Care Trusts to put in place all the necessary logistics,” he said.“We are now rolling out contact tracing further and working with the public to support people who may have been exposed so they can get tested and self-isolate to help prevent spread of infection.“We are progressing our plans for scaling up the second phase of the Northern Ireland contact tracing service, informed by the learning from the current pilot programme. This work involves testing all aspects of the programme.“From May  we have been undertaking contact tracing for all confirmed positive cases of Covid-.“Testing is also now available to everyone in Northern Ireland aged over five with symptoms, which will form an important part of the contact tracing programme.“The number of staff currently required changes each day in line with workload, but we have sufficient staff trained and available to manage contact tracing and meet demand.”The Department of Health is also taking forward work around digital solutions that can support the wider contact tracing programme when it goes live.The land border with the Republic of Ireland is an important factor in the spread of infectious diseases and therefore contact tracing.There are well-established systems in place to work with colleagues in the Republic on contact tracing and management of infectious diseases, and the health service is working at pace to develop new, more efficient ways of working collaboratively to reduce the spread of Covid-, and help protect cross-border travellers.For now contact tracing is being carried out exclusively by telephone and in a similar manner to the method used at beginning of the pandemic.“Our very first case was an inidual who landed in Dublin Airport then travelled to Northern Ireland back to their home and we saw the Public Health Agency and the Health Service Executive actually working together to do that contact tracing, so we’re taking that approach to begin with,” the Health Minister said.Mr Swann said he had spoken to his counterpart in the Republic, Simon Harris, on Tuesday morning regarding the development of a contact tracing app and he was also monitoring progress on digital technology within the NHS.“We’re still looking to see which will be the best fit for Northern Ireland,” he said, adding that two apps could be used in Northern Ireland until a bespoke app could be created.He had previously said that his preference would be for a single app which would work across the British Isles, butdferent apps were used they would be compatible.Contact tracing was suspended in Northern Ireland in mid-March. A pilot programme resumed on April  and Mr Swann said he expected the contact tracing service to be in place “for the next year at a minimum”.The Executive, guided by health experts, now believes the focus on contact tracing can help limit any impact of a second wave of Covid-.On Tuesday evening, a virtual meeting to discuss the ongoing response to coronavirus on both sides of the border took place between Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, the First and Deputy First Ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, Tanaiste Simon Coveney and the two health ministers.In a joint statement, Mr Coveney and Mr Lewis said they discussed the respective plans for emerging from lockdown “given the importance of implementing consistent approaches wherever possible and strong collaborative arrangements”.“Strong data-sharing arrangements North South would be a necessary part of the easing of restrictions,” they said.What is contact tracing Contact tracing aims to identy and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus.The process starts with someone who has been tested positive for Covid- being asked to list all the people they’ve recently been in prolonged contact with.A contact tracing team member will then phone these contacts and talk to them about their risk of infection. Everyone who has the infection and who is a close contact will have to self-isolate. To be successful in contact tracing people need to provide their phone number when they get a test.Why is it important Contact tracing has been credited with helping to lt restrictions in other countries, like South Korea, when combined with stringent testing measures.The most important element is speed.The five-stage process — sampling, testing, communication to a positive case, contact tracing and contact quarantine — all needs to be done in a -hour window to be effective in preventing spread.Why was it halted Contact tracing was halted by the UK government on March , though that proved to be a controversial move as many experts believed it was key to slowing the spread of the virus. The government was subsequently accused of not having the capacity to run it effectively.On April  the Department of Health in Northern Ireland restarted an ‘enhanced contact tracing pilot’, which, it says, is now operating five days a week. It’s felt by the Executive that it could prove crucial in limiting the impact of any second wave of coronavirus.That service is set to be expanded to operate over seven days soon.How does it operate in Northern Ireland For now, Northern Ireland is relying on telephone contact, but the speed of the process should increase dramaticallya mobile phone app becomes available.The process is off to a slow start and on May  the Health Minister said  staff were trained and working on contact tracing. On that date there were said to be  more tracers in training with a further  volunteers having come forward to join the list.In April Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride had said he estimated  to  staff would be needed for contact tracing to work efficiently.Is a contact tracing app likely to be used The development of an app to speed up the process of contact tracing is seen as key to maximising the impact of the scheme, but that has raised questions over whether Northern Ireland should be involved with the UK or on an all-Ireland basis.At the moment the UK and Irish governments are working on separate apps, but Health Minister Robin Swann said no decision has yet been made on the best way to proceed.The app would be able to identy people the patient may not know — like fellow passengers they have been in contact with on public transport or in supermarkets.But there have been concerns about privacy, particularly in Northern Ireland where security workers who may be reluctant to use it over fears their personal details could be compromised.Should contact tracing be organised on an all-Ireland basis Addressing media earlier this week, the Health Minister insisted there needed to be “a clarity of message”.And while a single app that works across both the UK and the Republic of Ireland would be the best solution for Northern Ireland, the logistics of that are proving problematic. Northern Ireland might have to settle for a compromise,it can be agreed, that would see UK app compatible with one in the Republic, arranged as part of the memorandum of understanding between authorities north and south of the border.Since Ireland is one geographical area, andcontact tracing is to be a long term project, then it makes sense to have an all-island approach.Is this likely to be a long term project The NI Executive has maintained that contact tracing is a crucial component for ending the lockdown, and that wider surveillance of the virus in the community is necessary.The system is expected to be in place for at least a year, possibly longer.

The headache was unreal. When it started coming on the news about the coronavirus and there was a list of the symptoms, it made me think. I#m convinced that it was coronavirus. I#ve never been as sick.Though many people are convinced they may have had coronavirus, medical experts disagree. Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Associationand a GP in Londonderry, says he is convinced that the bug making people sick before Christmas was a dferent virus.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it Dr Tom Black, British Medical AssociationThere certainly was a viral illness in December and January, he says. But it wouldn#t have been consistent with what we then found with the Covid virus. From a patient#s point of view you would have got a sore throat, a temperature, felt unwell, some vomiting and diarrhoea as well. So I suppose there are some similarities but that is because they are both viral illnesses. We certainly didn#t see the level of very severe respiratory symptoms that we then saw with Covid.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it.Dr Black says that he disagrees with suggestions that December#s widespread illness was in fact the first wave of coronavirus and that we have just left the deadly second wave.Our microbiology colleagues are very clear about when the infection came and when they were able to pick it up on their very accurate tests, he says. I think we are still in the first wave. The severity of Covid was markedly dferent from a standard flu. It is a much more severe illness in a minority and we didn#t see those patients until we were in the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern IrelandAnd Dr Black says, although there are less patients presenting to our hospitals, the virus is still out there. We have fewer cases appearing into general practice. We have fewer cases coming into the Covid centres that the GPs man and we have fewer cases in hospital and in ICU. So in all four areas we have reduced numbers of cases, he says. It#s not gone yet, it#s still endemic in the community. There seems to be a concentration in two places - in care homes and among health care workers. So we are going to have start increasing our testing of patients and staff in care homes, which has been announced by the minister. And we are going to have to increase our testing among health care workers.As for how many of us might have acquired herd immunity, Dr Black also estimates the numbers are still very low, saying that just % of the Northern Irish population might have had the virus already.

She confirmed that she is also in discussions with the Treasury regarding the possibility on conferring more powers to councils to raise funds.Ms Hargey said local government would provide a key role in the recovery of Northern Ireland#s economy, adding: I want to defend public services, I want to ensure that we keep them. I want to defend the workers as well, to ensure that they are employed at the other end of this. We will need to look at all options available to us when we get through this.Meanwhile, a £.m fund for struggling charities will be launched very shortly, with organisations able to apply for support with a limit of £,. Charities have been left in crisis as the pandemic has decimated fundraising, but many have seen increases in the number of people relying on their services.Many have furloughed staff after seeing their income streams completely collapse.The minister said: At a time where budgets are stretched and so many in our community are feeling the pain of the unprecedented situation, it is important that we maintain services for those most in need and those struggling low-income families.Ms Hargey also revealed that by the end of this week, more than , parcels will have been distributed in Northern Ireland since the start of April as part of her department#s scheme to help vulnerable people.Turning to sport, the minister said easing restrictions on those played on an all-island basis, such as rugby and GAA, will require the authorities on both sides of the border to move at the same time. Stormont#s recovery plan indicates ato close physical contact sports in phase five but with no projected dates. The Republic is envisaging rugby ing in phase five of its roadmap on August  and competitive GAA a month earlier on July .The authorities on both sides of the border are in agreement that crowd numbers attending games will be restricted indefinitely.Ms Hargey said her department was engaging with the main sporting codes on what measures could be taken to reduce the infection risk at events while the world waits on a vaccine for Covid-.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In labs around the globe they are racing against time in a frantic bid to create a Covid- vaccine ­- seen as the key to vanquishing the virus and setting society on the road back to normality.The world is waiting, hoping, expecting, but it is a pressure to deliver that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the scientic world.It is said the best way to tackle an enemy is to understand how that enemy operates, and that is why understanding the nature of Covid- is vital.There is still a lot more to find out .. This is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. The problem is, this is still a very new virus, said Dr Ultan Power, professor in molecular virology at Queen#s University.We have learnt so much about it in such a short space of time, it#s quite remarkable. But there#s still a lot more to find out.We know the virus does not have the ability to mutate in the way influenza changes. It#s not as dramatic as that, but this is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. We still don#t know what it will look like in one or two years# time. That#s an issue to begin with.The simplest way to imagine Covid- is as a tiny tennis ball with #spikes# around the surface, which are formed by proteins.Those spikes interact with another protein on the surface of the human cell called the ACE  Receptor.The spikes help the virus to roll along the cell until it comes across this receptor.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan Power FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan PowerThe ACE  Receptor is the lock, the spike protein is the key. Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

Picture by Frank McGrathCatherine FeganMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMiguel Plangca was  when he left his home in Ozamis city in the Philippines for a new le in Ireland.Like many Filipinos who relocate to the Republic, he had come for employment and managed to secure a job in Naas with Green Isle, one of the country#s biggest frozen food producers.For the next  years he did little  but work, clocking up thousands of gruelling hours on the factory packaging line and sending money home to his we Gilceria and his five children in the Philippines.When Gilceria died from cancer in , his heartbroken children came to live with him in Naas, Co Kildare.Last week, tragedy struck the Plangca children once again when Miguelsuccumbed to the coronavirus.My Dad made so many sacrices for us. He was a good man and everything he did he did for us Mikee PlangcaIt came as such a shock, his -year-old daughter Mikee told the Irish Independent.Dad had been sick for about a week in the house, with a cough and what he thought was a cold and then he ended up in ICU. He spent  days there before he died. It#s very hard for us to take it all in at the minute.Together with her siblings Michael , Johnand Chekie , Mikee is now an orphan.I#m concentrating on minding my brothers and sisters for now, she said.We don#t know what will happen. We would like to stay in Ireland because that#s where we have made a le, where our friends are and our [Filipino] community is, but we don#t know.The Plangca children first arrived in Ireland four years ago. Until then, they had lived their lives in the Philippines, where their only contact with their father was through video calls and twice-yearly visits.Their half-sister Stephanie, a daughter Miguel had from a previous relationship, was living in Abu Dhabi.My father made a decision many years ago to come here to provide for us, said Mikee. holds a photograph of her father Miguel who was a factory worker and lost his le to Covid-, leaving Mikee and her  siblings orphans.

Picture by Frank McGrathHe left so we could stay in the Philippines and have a better quality of le. Every month he sent money home to us.We were like many other families in the Philippines who had a parent in another country working to provide.Then when my mother died, we came here to Ireland to live with him.After completing sixth year at school in Prosperous, Co Kildare, Mikee opted out of going to college.Instead, she applied to be a full-time carer for her brother Michael, who has intellectual disabilities.My brother is my responsibility, said Mikee.When we first came to Ireland, Dad was working day shts but he switched to night shts so that I could go to school. He looked after Michael during the day and worked at night.My Dad made so many sacrices for us. He was a good man and everything he did he did for us.Meanwhile, Miguel#s sister Fely had followed in her brother#s footsteps by moving to Ireland herself in .She later married an Irish man and settled in Naas, where she works as a childminder.I was working in the Philippines, not earning a lot of money and my brother encouraged me to come here, she said. I met an Irish man and got married and I made a le here too.When Gilceria died and the children came here Miguel was finding it dficult to cope on his own and he talked about moving back to the Philippines. I said no, you can do this, so they moved in.My husband said to bring them in to live with us and that#s where they were living when this all happened.After Miguel fell ill with Covid-, Fely also contracted the virus.We were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong Miguel#s sister, Fely Miguel was hospitalised on April  and Fely joined him in Naas General hospital six days later. When Miguel#s children were tested, Mikee and Michael were found to be Covid positive.Michael and I had no symptoms, said Mikee. We self-isolated in the house for a month. We were too scared to go out.Fely was discharged on April , but her brother#s condition worsened.My mother and siblings would call him every night at six o#clock, she said.They would talk to him in his hospital bed and we were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong.Last year, the Green Isle pizza manufacturing site in Naas where Miguel worked was bought over by Birdseye.Colleagues remember him as a kind and gentle colleague. When he became ill, the Filipino community stepped in to look after his young family.We had to try to help out as best we could, said Aina Conway, president of the Kildare Filipino Community.They have recovered but they have lost their father and they are in shock. I speak to Mikee most days and she has cried every day since her father was brought in to ICU. At the moment she is just trying to be strong for the little ones.Together with the Philippine consulate, the Kildare Filipino Community are raising money in aid of the Plangca children.They have their aunt, but Mikee has been the mum for a long time, said Aina.Now that they have lost their father, they need all the support we can give them. Miguel came here to provide a better le for his children. You look at the kids now and that#s them forever, with no parents. It#s incredibly sad.

Concerns have centred around access to the pound, grant, the pound, grant and also the support for those who are self-employed. Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, has called on Economy Minister Diane Dodds to make improvements to the scheme. She said: “One of the biggest challenges we first encountered was that manufacturing and engineering firms, who avail of industrial derating, were excluded from the relief package. “Thankfully, this was addressed by the minister following quite an amount of pressure, but there are still a number of business models that have been excluded. googletag.cmd.push “Businesses who rent their premises were initially unable to apply, having been told to wait for a second phase of help which became available on April th. “The criteria that came with this second phase only caters for sole tenants, meaning that anyone who rents a unit in a premises with multiple businesses, or rents a part of a business space, has been excluded. I cannot see the logic in this, and feel this discriminates against small business owners who never could have foreseen these circumstances. “A business does not see their running costs diminish just because they have a neighbouring business above or below them who happens to rent off the same landlord.” googletag.cmd.push The Mid Ulster MLA, who sits on Stormont’s Audit Committee, said she welcomed a new ‘microbusiness’ package to be introduced next week, but also voiced concerns about dferences from the original scheme. “The minister has announced a microbusiness package which will become available next week, which is certainly much welcomed news,” she said. “However, I am worried that this is unlikely to be worth the same poundk award as the initial scheme, with the provision grants up to poundk outlined in the criteria suggesting that it might depend on uptake. “Given that there was no requirement on any business to prove turnover or ongoing costs to avail of the first grants, which I understand happened for expediency reasons, it is unfair to expect similarly sized businesses, with similar operating costs, to settle for lower grant awards due to a technicality. I have written to Minister Dodds again this week communicating that all renting businesses should be included in the first scheme, andnot, the microbusiness package must guarantee poundk awards for all successful applicants.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The move means the decision will be revisited by the council after unionist councillors initially blocked a Sinn Feacutein motion on the issue. Cllr Leanne Peacock topping up the wages was the right thing to do. When the furlough scheme was introduced there was an appeal from government for employers to top up the full wages of their employees by adding the additional %, she said. That is the right thing to do and that is why we proposed that as a responsible public sector employer that the Causeway Coast and Glens Council should certainly ensure their staff are paid % of their wages. googletag.cmd.push Unfortunately at the meeting when this was decided Unionist councillors turned their backs on council staff and voted against our proposal. “However, in the hours and days following the meeting it became clear that Councillors had not been provided with all the information required to make an informed decision on this issue. Sinn Feacutein have engaged with Trade Unions, staff and council officers and it became clear that Councillors had once again been asked to make a decision with only part of the information on the issue. Trade Unions had not been meaningfully consulted prior to this decision and discussions with council on the furlough of staff are still ongoing.” googletag.cmd.push “We are disappointed that the full information was not available to elected members prior to the decision been taken and potential agreement with Trade Unions had not been fully explored- we felt given these facts that it was essential to ‘call-in’ the decision. Councillors were not given an opportunity to arrive at a decision giving consideration to all of the relevant information and facts which erodes the democratic process and is by the very definition, the purpose of the ‘call-in’ mechanism.” NIPSAs Alan Law reiterated its call for the council to ensure its workers receive % of normal pay. He said: NIPSA reiterates it’s call on Causeway Coast and Glens BC to enter into constructive negotiations to agree a process for the furlough of staff which will ensure that Council can maximise funding available to it from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. We continue to insist that our members terms and conditions of employment are respected and that staff who are furloughed receive % of normal pay.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

TheNorthWestMinistryofYou thProject has  members across Derry and Strabane who have formed ayouthcouncil and are currently putting together a manesto for change. The cross border and cross community project is for young people aged  to  and allows them to be the voice for the young people in theNorthWest. It normally includes residential and activity based work, study visits, local workshops, confidence building and skills development. However, these were all cancelled due to the lockdown. Project Manager of theNorthWestMinistryofYou thProject , Barry Fennell, decided to use video conferencing technology to allow the group to continue to come together and share ideas. googletag.cmd.push TheTheNorthWestMinistry ofYouthhas successfully managed to harness the new technology to continue their work and has now set up a series of sub committees to look at employability, learning, health, sport and the environment. As the project progresses the group will put together a youth manesto which will lay out the changes they would like to see in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area. Mr Fennell said the group have adapted remarkably well to the changes in their circumstances. They have been brilliant in terms of their ability to continue and they are very switchedon. We are still having our weekly meetings through Zoom and that allows us to keep those connections at this time and try and continue with this project as well. googletag.cmd.push Co-chair of the group Plunkett Roarty, who is in Year  at Lumen Christi College, said video conferencing is the next best thing to meeting face to face. Due to the coronaviruscrisis we have had to use resources such as Zoom to stay in contact and come together to share ideas and tackle the key issues, he said. Plunkett is part of the Department for Health and Well-being which is tackling issues such as mental health and positive body image. At the minute we are at the discussion stage aboutplans and initiatives to tackle that, he explained. Video conferencing is a useful tool and we are still able to get a lot done. The members of the group are also enjoying the chance to socialise online. With school being off and all my sports training being cancelled the Zoom meetings area chance to meet up and see familiar faces who are facing the same issues as you, said Plunkett.North West Ministry of Youth – Youth Voices Project is delivered by Co-operation Ireland and Education Authority. This opportunity is funded by the EU’s PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body. Match-funding has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.

Derry  Strabane People Before Profit Cllrs Eamonn McCann and Shaun Harkin said: People Before Profit joins other parties in welcoming the announcement that the Stormont Executive has approved a graduate-entry Medical School at Magee.We take this as a down-payment on the first instalment of what Stormont owes to the working-class people of the North West.Every place in the proposed medical school will be a boost for Derry - and will whet Derry’s appetite for delivery of the rest of what’s been promised.However, we mustn’t allow approval of the medical school to ert attention from the target agreed by all parties of , extra full-time student places. Approval of the medical school cannot be a substitute for expansion of third-level education generally. We wont be settling for  additional students a year when the numbers have been cut by hundreds in recent years.The embarrassing scramble for political credit for getting the medical school approved is in full swing. The fact is that every party in the North West with elected representatives has fully supported the medical school. The task now is not to demand a share of success but to recognise how far short this falls from what Derry has demanded down through the years.And we must keep in mind that all that we have so far is the promise. It is not cynical, particularly not in Derry, to say that we’ll fully believe it when we clearly see it. googletag.cmd.push And questions still remain about who will deliver third-level education provision here. The institution with that responsibility doesnt have the trust of those whove witnessed its deliberate policy of downgrading Derry for decades.It was possible to believe for  years that the reason Derry had been cheated of third-level education was that sectarian unionism didn’t want proper development of gerrymandered Derry. But that explanation won’t wash now.In the last  years, Derry has had Deputy First Ministers, Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Education etc. - all from a nationalist background. Those establishment parties have systematically let the people of Derry and the North West down and delivery of the medical school wont make up for their failures.We shouldn’t stop to savour this interim success, but rather take it as encouragement to push on towards full delivery of Derry’s entitlement. We will continue on our present path, working with other parties and campaign groups, including trades unions and student unions, to bring this saga to success at last. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes just days after Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that the long-awaited Derry medical school had been agreed by the Executive and said she expects students to enrol in September . Speaking at yesterday’s economy committee meeting, deputy chair and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said: “It would be remiss of me not to thank you in relation to the Executive announcement regarding Magee, and I know there’s still work to be done but there is an imminent deadline and obviously the first intake of students is September  according to the announcement. googletag.cmd.push “We’re delighted about that and the whole city is definitely celebrating that good news story. Hopefully whatever work has to be done in the next few weeks, everything will go through.” In response DUP Minister Diane Dodds highlighted ‘signicant work’ that has to be done and said additional papers will be presented to the Executive. She commented: “The announcement on the Magee Medical School was a good announcement for the Executive to make, a good announcement for the city, but more importantly just a good announcement for the whole of Northern Ireland. “It is quite clear that we need more doctors and we want more of our young people to be able to train and re-train.” googletag.cmd.push However, she added: “I’m not pretending that the path ahead is easy, there is a signicant amount of work to do in relation to the issues around capacity of Ulster University and the financial position of Ulster University. And there is a signicant amount of work to do about that. “But we have set ourselves on a pathway and we are working quite hard on that. There will be further papers to the Executive on that in due course.” In February the Department of Finance confirmed that a poundm loan had been agreed in the form of an ‘addendum to the business case’ for Ulster University’s vastly over-budget Belfast campus. The Department for the Economy will be responsible for overall approval. The relocation of Jordanstown to Belfast city centre was initially expected to cost poundm but swelled to around poundm. FURTHER WORK On Monday, May , Deputy First Minister revealed that the medical school had been given the go-ahead. But, a short time later, the department responsible for its delivery said further work is needed to guarantee student intake next year. An Executive Office spokesperson stated: “The Executive has reaffirmed its commitment to establish a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee, as set out in New Decade, New Approach. “Further work is being undertaken to secure a sustainable outcome for the project within the fastest possible timescales. “Plans are being progressed that would allow an initial student intake of  in September  and the Executive will consider this issue again next month.” To begin with the school will train  doctors within existing buildings on the Magee campus. Supported by City Deal money, a new Medical School facility is expected to be built along the riverfront but that is likely to lie some years ahead. When fully operational with  students in   it will cost poundm to run per year, according to UU. Speaking at Monday’s press conference Michelle O’Neill said plans are being progressed that ‘will allow the first student intake of  in September ’. She added: “This is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. ‘GUARANTEE’ SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has asked for more detail and said a ‘guarantee’ was needed that students will start in . He believes student intake in  is ‘far from certain’ and there are a number of issues to be addressed, including the matter of recurring funding from the Executive. “People don’t have to be put through the hoops that we’ve been put through to get something for Derry but it is largely down to the need for recurring funding. “It’s hopeful, it’s positive, it’s good, but I do think we need to ask questions about how certain this is and I think we’re right to do that given all that we’ve been through.” In terms of long-term goals for expansion, the Foyle MP added: “We need to keep our eye on the big prize and that is , students.” While welcoming the news DUP MLA Gary Middleton said he ‘hoped’ the Magee Medical School would be delivered in . Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Derry University Group , which is campaigning for an independent university in the city, said it is proposing that all future Higher Educationdevelopment in the North West be led and managed under the auspices of an independent university. He added: “UU has neither the finance, capacity nor political will to deliver for Derry. “To that end Derry and Donegal Councils should immediately establish their own HE Development and Scrutiny Committee.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since then ious groups have fought for a meaningful expansion of the Derry campus. Guarantees of expansion to , students have been repeatedly pushed back, the latest target set by the council and Ulster University is , placesby . The Derry News has taken a closer look at the journey since plans for a Medical School were first mooted in the early s.  In March  Ulster Universityofficially announces plans to build a post-graduate Medical School, however, it had been discussed for years already at this stage. googletag.cmd.push Also in , UU agreed to acquire several acres of lands for expansion at Foyle College on the Duncreggan Road. Those plans would not come to fruition for many years. By   plans were raised to build a major poundm Health Sciences facility in Derry as part of Magee expansion, to help increase numbers from around , studentsto ,. This expansion was shelved in tandem with the announcement that UU would be building an entirely new Stormont-backed Belfast campus – initially expected to cost poundm. As part of ’s multi-agency Derry One Plan UU committed itself to having , full-time students at Magee by . googletag.cmd.push In February , the Minister with responsibility for Higher Education, Stephen Farry, postponed any expansion. He said the Stormont Programme for Government ‘did not contain a commitment to deliver expansion as outlined in the One Plan’. In  UU submits plans for the Medical School and applies to the General Medical Councilto train doctors in the North West. May , First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness reaffirm their commitment to Magee expansion in a draft framework for government. January  Stormont collapses after Martin McGuinness resigns in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. March , UU works on a number of recommendations made by the Department of Health- including how the school would be funded - but UU says the school remains on track. Professor Louise Dubras is appointed to oversee the delivery of the Medical School. In May , UU appoints Prof Louise Dubras as Foundation Dean of the School of Medicine. In June , the DoH says UU had yet to meet criteria to ‘demonstrate need and value for money’ for a new medical school. November , Ulster University vice chancellor Prof Paddy Nixon confirms the planned  opening cannot go ahead because there is no devolved government. In January  the lands at Foyle College are eventually purchased after drawn-out negotiations. Ambitions for these lands have not be shared. May , a pound City Deal is announced for Derry and Strabane. It later emerges that UU will receive poundm for the Medical School and other projects. November , plans are once again abandoned to open the Medical School and a new target is set for student intake in September  - the absence of a government is blamed. Throughout  Derry councillors express their anger at ongoing delays, demand expansion and call on the council to attach conditions to City Deal funding granted to UU. January , , devolved government is restored in NI after three years of deadlock. The New Decade, New Approach document which secured that deal vowed to expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School. On January , , a senior official at the Department for the Economy says the business case for overall Magee expansion ‘doesn’t stack up’ and is ‘very out of date’. She explains that the department doesn’t have money for Magee expansion while simultaneously announcing plans to grant UU a poundm bailout for its vastly over-budget Belfast campus. April , , Ulster University confirms that government sign-off is neededthe Medical School is to open as planned in September . At the beginning of May , the DoH states that the business case requires ‘signicant work’ and any decision must have Executive agreement. May , Derry City Deal match funding confirmed bringing the total to poundm. There is renewed optimism that a Medical School will be delivered. On May  The Executive Office assumes responsibility for delivering the Medical School. And on May  Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announces that the Medical School has been approved with a view to opening in September .

Since then ious groups have fought for a meaningful expansion of the Derry campus. Guarantees of expansion to , students have been repeatedly pushed back, the latest target set by the council and Ulster University is , placesby . The Derry News has taken a closer look at the journey since plans for a Medical School were first mooted in the early s.  In March  Ulster Universityofficially announces plans to build a post-graduate Medical School, however, it had been discussed for years already at this stage. googletag.cmd.push Also in , UU agreed to acquire several acres of lands for expansion at Foyle College on the Duncreggan Road. Those plans would not come to fruition for many years. By   plans were raised to build a major poundm Health Sciences facility in Derry as part of Magee expansion, to help increase numbers from around , studentsto ,. This expansion was shelved in tandem with the announcement that UU would be building an entirely new Stormont-backed Belfast campus – initially expected to cost poundm. As part of ’s multi-agency Derry One Plan UU committed itself to having , full-time students at Magee by . googletag.cmd.push In February , the Minister with responsibility for Higher Education, Stephen Farry, postponed any expansion. He said the Stormont Programme for Government ‘did not contain a commitment to deliver expansion as outlined in the One Plan’. In  UU submits plans for the Medical School and applies to the General Medical Councilto train doctors in the North West. May , First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness reaffirm their commitment to Magee expansion in a draft framework for government. January  Stormont collapses after Martin McGuinness resigns in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. March , UU works on a number of recommendations made by the Department of Health- including how the school would be funded - but UU says the school remains on track. Professor Louise Dubras is appointed to oversee the delivery of the Medical School. In May , UU appoints Prof Louise Dubras as Foundation Dean of the School of Medicine. In June , the DoH says UU had yet to meet criteria to ‘demonstrate need and value for money’ for a new medical school. November , Ulster University vice chancellor Prof Paddy Nixon confirms the planned  opening cannot go ahead because there is no devolved government. In January  the lands at Foyle College are eventually purchased after drawn-out negotiations. Ambitions for these lands have not be shared. May , a pound City Deal is announced for Derry and Strabane. It later emerges that UU will receive poundm for the Medical School and other projects. November , plans are once again abandoned to open the Medical School and a new target is set for student intake in September  - the absence of a government is blamed. Throughout  Derry councillors express their anger at ongoing delays, demand expansion and call on the council to attach conditions to City Deal funding granted to UU. January , , devolved government is restored in NI after three years of deadlock. The New Decade, New Approach document which secured that deal vowed to expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School. On January , , a senior official at the Department for the Economy says the business case for overall Magee expansion ‘doesn’t stack up’ and is ‘very out of date’. She explains that the department doesn’t have money for Magee expansion while simultaneously announcing plans to grant UU a poundm bailout for its vastly over-budget Belfast campus. April , , Ulster University confirms that government sign-off is neededthe Medical School is to open as planned in September . At the beginning of May , the DoH states that the business case requires ‘signicant work’ and any decision must have Executive agreement. May , Derry City Deal match funding confirmed bringing the total to poundm. There is renewed optimism that a Medical School will be delivered. On May  The Executive Office assumes responsibility for delivering the Medical School. And on May  Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announces that the Medical School has been approved with a view to opening in September .

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

A former art teacher, Christines weekly schedule involved the school runs and looking after her grandchildren, while playing golf and helping around at Lavey club. When ‘lockdown’ began eight weeks ago, my day-to-day le changed, Christine said. The club gates were locked up and I missed calling in there every day. My husband, Paddy, is Chairman of the Club and could always have found an excuse to call in and attend to something or other. In her new routine, she has been updating all the family photo albums. After being inspired by Mary K Burkes photo of her son Damian in action for Lavey against Greenlough last season, she decided to paint this masterpiece, which called‘Love Our Club, Love Lavey’. googletag.cmd.push I took some photographs of our clubhouse and top pitch to help with the overall composition. I was trying to capture the colour, excitement and special atmosphere of match days. The only part of the painting that is from an actual game is the high catch at midfield the rest of the players and supporters are imagined, although I did model two of the younger supporters on Eimear and Aodhan, my grandchildren, who are under-age players and keen fans.

Their ,km -hour relay exceeded all expectations. The late Brian Calvert wouldve had a glint in his eye. His children jogged along Church Street towards the towns Diamond to a ripple of applause from the socially distant well-wishers. Covid- dictated the magnitude of their welcome. Below the surface, was a community united by a buzz and togetherness that will never be forgotten. It knew no boundaries. Pearses now overseas, also ran, walked and put their hands in their pockets. All in the name of the chosen charity - the NI Chest, Heart and Stroke Association. googletag.cmd.push Last year, a sudden heart attack took Brian from a community he was a cornerstone of. Not only was he Kilreas U football manager, but his -years as an instructor at the local Woodhall Outdoor Pursuits Centre shaped the lives of many. Three-years ago, Brian cycled around Ireland with his friend Randal McAllister in memory of Randals daughter and to raise money for two cancer charities. It was an eight-day adventure, taking in ,km of Irelands testing hills and plains. Last weekends event in Kilrea, wouldve been something Brian wouldve been at the forefront of. Tommy Donaghy would not have been far behind him. googletag.cmd.push Tommy also passed away last year. He was a prominent clubman, a talented footballer in his day and embraced fitness in his later years. He was an avid runner around the town and when the club kitted out their Pearse Park gym, Tommy would train other men there, helping to keep them healthy. An offering of themselves for the good of others and Brian Calvert and Tommy Donaghys memories were honoured on Sunday morning. In a very fitting manner. The seismic response told it all. It all emerged out of senior players Brian Oacuteg McAlary and Karen Kielts running exploits to maintain their fitness. An instinct to raise some money transformed into a relay that just grew and grew. The rest of the community – both at home and abroad – put their shoulder to the wheel and the distance quadrupled by the time the Calverts crossed the finish line. The aim was to raise what later proved to be a modest pound,. With every passing hour, the money was pouring in. At the time of writing, the Justgiving page nudged past pound,, by the time gt aid is accrued. Brian Oacuteg and Karen were backed by the committee. And Kilreas core did the rest. Step by Step. Kilometre by kilometre. Pound by pound. Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Strokes mission statement is about leading the fight against the illnesses highlighted in their name. Kilrea have more than done their bit. They are this weeks GAA story of selflessness, but they are not on their own. The previous week, Coleraine pooled together for a ,km relay to raise money for the Samaritans and Christina Passmores contribution deserves a special mention.  Christina Passmore does her bit in Eoghan Rua fundraiser The -year-old mother of the clubs All-Ireland winning camogie manager Joe and granny of Derry goalkeeper Leo, took part. A staunch Tyrone woman, Christina loves her sport, Joe told me. The GAA giving theme continued. It was impossible not to be touched by the Kildare man Dan McCabes rendition of Mary Blacks A Song for Ireland. It will be the best four and a half minutes you will spend this week. His voice is staggering, but it accompanied photos from every corner of Irelanddepicting GAA clubs support during the current pandemic. Make sure you watch it. We can all relate to it. Dungiven united to setup a community group within days of lockown. The same thing happened in Ballinascreen, with the local GAA club also donating their lotto proceeds. “It was a chance for the club to contribute to the community during these dficult times, because over the years the community has played a massive role in the running of Ballinascreen GAC,” Mickey Boyle pointed out in an interview last month. There was a photo of Ballyronan Marina Centre, which Loup were using as a base to mobilse their support for the local community in the surrounding area. Along the shores of Lough Neagh, Ballinderry made their changing rooms available to healthcare workers to change on their way home from a sht. In Ballymaguigan, a slick supply of food wasnt lost on the locals. “Winning trophies can be very uplting, but in these trying times this is what the GAA is all about,” was a sentence from a handwritten letter. It was sent to the club by one of the clubs senior citizens who was honoured to be a member after receiving one of the hampers.  A letter sent to Ballymaguigan club The GAA, the gt that keeps on giving. We complain about it and, no doubt, we will again. For now, its time to soak up every drop of goodness it oozes. And its not all about money and gts. It is about time. Within days of the lockdown, Dungiven began a skills competition to engage its younger members and only last weekend, they posted up a montage of their senior players baby photos. It will generate laughter, slagging and craic. Three things we need plenty of at the minute. Andrena OKane devised a skills challenge that tested the underage skill and gable walls of Banagher, one that other clubs adopted for their own. On Sunday, former Derry coach Killian Conlans son Dan was throwing dummiesbefore pinging the ball off the back stanchion in the goals in their back yard, which hugs the boundary of Shamrock Park. Off the pitch, Paul Gunning and his father Sean have been engaging  teams in Glens online quiz. Noel McKenna has been doing the same in Castledawson. Derrys GAAs social media feed has had interviews with past players recalling moments in the red and white. Ronan Rocks made one phonecall to a former county player and soon Mickey Sheehy was on the phone to his father chatting football. I pinged a message to Joe Oacute Muircheartaigh and a few days later my father-in-law Patsy Kennedys phone rang on his th birthday. On the other side of the line Joes uncle Miacutecheaacutel, the broadcasting legend. You might as well have reached Patsy a million pound. Tommy Diamond. Niall Mullan. Kieran Stevenson. Jim McGroarty. Ciaran McNally. Eugene Laverty. Kenny Bradley. Gerry McElhinney. Tommy McKenna. Colm Mulholland. Ten men I never spoke to in my le before, but in recent weeks they have lted the lid to our readers on their memories. And they loved doing so. With no sport to attend and people getting fed up with the inner workings of Covid-, nostalgia is the welcome solace. And,Kilrea and other clubs community spirit are signs, then the GAA will be a better place when the balls start flying around the pitch again.

Their ,km -hour relay exceeded all expectations. The late Brian Calvert wouldve had a glint in his eye. His children jogged along Church Street towards the towns Diamond to a ripple of applause from the socially distant well-wishers. Covid- dictated the magnitude of their welcome. Below the surface, was a community united by a buzz and togetherness that will never be forgotten. It knew no boundaries. Pearses now overseas, also ran, walked and put their hands in their pockets. All in the name of the chosen charity - the NI Chest, Heart and Stroke Association. googletag.cmd.push Last year, a sudden heart attack took Brian from a community he was a cornerstone of. Not only was he Kilreas U football manager, but his -years as an instructor at the local Woodhall Outdoor Pursuits Centre shaped the lives of many. Three-years ago, Brian cycled around Ireland with his friend Randal McAllister in memory of Randals daughter and to raise money for two cancer charities. It was an eight-day adventure, taking in ,km of Irelands testing hills and plains. Last weekends event in Kilrea, wouldve been something Brian wouldve been at the forefront of. Tommy Donaghy would not have been far behind him. googletag.cmd.push Tommy also passed away last year. He was a prominent clubman, a talented footballer in his day and embraced fitness in his later years. He was an avid runner around the town and when the club kitted out their Pearse Park gym, Tommy would train other men there, helping to keep them healthy. An offering of themselves for the good of others and Brian Calvert and Tommy Donaghys memories were honoured on Sunday morning. In a very fitting manner. The seismic response told it all. It all emerged out of senior players Brian Oacuteg McAlary and Karen Kielts running exploits to maintain their fitness. An instinct to raise some money transformed into a relay that just grew and grew. The rest of the community – both at home and abroad – put their shoulder to the wheel and the distance quadrupled by the time the Calverts crossed the finish line. The aim was to raise what later proved to be a modest pound,. With every passing hour, the money was pouring in. At the time of writing, the Justgiving page nudged past pound,, by the time gt aid is accrued. Brian Oacuteg and Karen were backed by the committee. And Kilreas core did the rest. Step by Step. Kilometre by kilometre. Pound by pound. Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Strokes mission statement is about leading the fight against the illnesses highlighted in their name. Kilrea have more than done their bit. They are this weeks GAA story of selflessness, but they are not on their own.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

The groups’ online presence through Facebook groups and pages has given many of those who are isolating a much-needed focus during a stressful time. Stephen McCracken, who runs the Limavady Past and Present Facebook group along with Matthew Harron, says people are using their time to reminisce. “During the lockdown this has provided an absolutely vital service to the greater Limavady Area,” he said. “People laugh, reminisce and learn from the daily posts. This has helped so many people with their mental health, of which is often a part of all of us unseen or covered up. googletag.cmd.push “We as admins are playing our small role in the current situation and are delighted that so many are using it. It has now over ,  members of which many are participants.” Stephen’s colleague Matthew Harron took over the page after the previous owner took his own le and the duo have been encouraged by comments of how it has helped others. “I love reading about Limavady of old,” commented one user. “There were so many characters that made up an interesting town  so much knowledge in this group that every day I learn something new about a town I havent lived in for  years.” googletag.cmd.push Another page helping its local community is the ‘Le on Slieve Gallion Braes, its people and its history’, which is based in Derry’s Slieve Gallion area. Page member Johnny McCallion said the page had been a ‘massive help’ for him during lockdown. He said: “It has made it possible for me to keep in contact with family and indeed friends over the mountain and further afield, because I cant travel from Derry to visit themat the moment. “The banter, the craic and the obvious support from all the members has added a new dimension of caring and supportive care to the group.” Fellow user Brenda Murray added: “This page has created a great and informative history on past and present events, community, and iniduals. “It shows so many dferent aspects of the beautul area we live in. It has reached out to so many in this dficult time from people living in the area to people with ancestral connections. “It has helped me and many others through lockdown just by reading the updates and seeing the beautul pictures.” The appetite for local history and news has been further strengthened as the Covid- restrictions have given people more time to learn about their surroundings. Roisin Cuskeran, admin of the Slieve Gallion page, says the communication it provides at this time is ‘vital’. “I think the page brings people together, gives them a forum for communication that’s vital especially in the current situation,” she said. “It gives them that sense of community and the security in knowing they are not going through this alone. “It’s helping to distract people from the topic of Covid also therefore helping their mental health and bringing together people from all over the world. “They all have a common connection- links to the Slieve Gallion Area - and because of this the members are helping each other cope with the reality of what is going on around us.” Jonathan Hudson, admin of the Magherafelt Facebook group, says he is amazed at the interest in local history. Im always amazed at peoples reactions to local history, just shows how little we were told in school, he said. Since lockdown, the numbers shot up over another  which was to be expected I suppose. However, people really embraced anything we did. I decided to do a musical tribute to the NHS, key workers and carers. It went brilliantly, dozens of local musicians and singers all sent in phone footage of two songs, including both local semi-finalists in this years The Voice, Brooke Scullion and Jonny Brooks. The video has just hit , views across social media so that tells its own story about how popular the page is. People are genuinely interested in how the town became what it is today. I tend to post the good and the bad, its all history and the one thing we can all learn from is our history.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery. This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities. At the moment, it is not yet known how many employees will be affected..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Cyclists.jpg","title":"Cyclists Zwifting in virtual races  ","story":"SO what is this new craze  Virtual cycling has been about for quite a few years and is basically riding your bicycle on a trainer in a virtual world.There are many apps and s available but the most popular is Zwt. This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley. Frankie Fitzsimons was fourth on Davy Blackrsquos Anns Penny.The winner, making his debut, ran in the colours of Rathfrilandrsquos Sam McKee, better known as Uel, who told me not all that long ago, that they arrived at the track that day in a makesht horse box and parked beside some of the lorries from top stables.The East DownshireOpen Farmers Race went to Grange Valleyrsquo, owned and trained by former good amateur Ballymenarsquos Samy Patton and ridden by Robert Steele, who rode all his runners.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them.

Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it.

If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy.

This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle.

We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside.

Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews. John will be sorely missed. May he rest in peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18448528.residents-pay-tribute-frontline-workers-music/resources/images/11387912.jpg","title":"punters win   day  years bet tonights cashlife","story":"LottoGo, the UKs leading lottery betting** website, have launched a new daily game calledCashLeFancy your chances on tonights LottoGo CashLe game To celebrate,LottoGoTheyre offering new players a chance to pick uptwo bets for just pound.Click here to get  bets on tonights LottoGo CashLeOffer available to new players only.

total of £. million to NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd PartyCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council will continue to ensure vital public services are protected.“Council welcomes the announcement by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, and will continue to work with the Minister, and colleagues across councils, to make the case for support of local government to ensure vital public services are protected,” said the spokesperson.Adam

Building on the poundmillion scheme announced in March which gave all businesses a threemonth rates holiday, the new scheme will result in businesses in the following sectors being relieved of the obligation to pay rates for the full financial year up to  March : * hospitality, tourism and leisure* retail * childcare* Belfast City, Belfast International and City of Derry Airports. All businesses will also receive a one-month extension of the rates holiday up to  July . Minister Murphy confirmed: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the economy. The initial rates support package helped businesses with immediate cash-flow dficulties during the lockdown. As the Executive begins to ease the restrictions which have been necessary to save lives, I am pleased to announce this new scheme which importantly provides all businesses with an extended rates holiday for July. “Further support is then targeted at the sectors which will be in greatest need in the months ahead. This includes retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare and airports. This rates package, which is aligned with the Executive’s pathway to recovery, brings the total support for businesses from rates relief and grants to almost poundmillion.” Education Minister Peter Weir welcomed the Executive’s approval of an income scheme to support substitute teachers who are unable to access secure work during the Covid- shutdown of schools. With many schools closed during the pandemic except those supervising vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers, eligible substitute teachers, who were engaged between  January  to  March , will have access to an income for the period April to June . An additional income through this scheme will top up their income to at least % of that earned in the period. Minister Weir acknowledged: “I am fully aware of the signicant impact this pandemic has had on our pupils, teaching and non-teaching staff. The issue of funding for substitute teachers, who are unable to work and therefore unable to be paid, is one that and I, and my Department, have been working hard to resolve. Today, I am pleased to announce that we will be introducing an income support scheme for substitute teachers through the Covid- Response fund. The estimated total cost of the scheme is around poundmillion. My Department will allocate up to poundmillion and the Executive has agreed to fund the remaining poundmillion. I would also like to thank the Finance Minister for his support in this matter. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced the Executive had allocated an additional poundmillion to support the most vulnerable people in housing during the Covid- emergency. The Supporting People Programme provides housing support for approximately , vulnerable iniduals living independently including: homeless people, older people, young people, and people with physical disabilities, learning disabilities and mental health issues. The additional funds will help maintain Supporting People services, which are commissioned by the Housing Executive and delivered through the public and voluntary and community sectors. Minister Hargey explained: “The additional funding will be used to address signicant staff shortages in the immediate term and mounting pressure in this area,the number of Covid- cases continues to increase. The money will fund overtime costs for existing staff and the use of the bank or agency staffing that is necessaryservices are to be maintained. Extra cleaning is also required, and the matter of a sufficient and adequate supply of PPE is being addressed.  “These are unusual times which demand actions and solutions. This funding allocation represents our commitment to the vulnerable people in Supporting People schemes, and the staff providing support to them. We support them and we are working hard to ensure their safety and wellbeing.” The allocation was also welcomed by Health Minister Robin Swann who added: “It is well recognised that supported living services better enable people to live to their full potential and reduce the need for acute health and social care services. Their value in society cannot be underestimated. “Officials across both departments are in regular communication to identy and address Covid- priorities across our Supporting People schemes. As a result my Department has now extended Covid- testing to all staff and residents of Supporting People schemes as well as providing a temporary supply of Personal Protective Equipment.” It was revealed by Minister Hargey that local councils will also be given pound.million to alleviate financial pressures as a result of the Covid- restrictions. The funding will ensure councils can continue to provide essential services and support those in need. Minister Hargey said: “Despite the current Covid- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in delivering essential services such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemetery services. The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring our health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities. “This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time but will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.” The Minister previously announced that councils here are eligible to apply to furlough staff through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. This will help ensure that the rights of workers are respected and jobs are protected. This scheme along with this additional funding are supporting councils through this period.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cedacce   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cddbafafeabbfdae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
