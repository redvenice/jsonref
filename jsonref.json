One of Claudia’s last phone calls before she vanished was from her mum. They talked of meeting up for Mother’s Day and chatted about the TV programme Location, Location, Location. Pictured: Claudia aged 10Alternatively, could Claudia have fled to Cyprus, smuggled overseas in a van, to start a secret new life for reasons unknown?The last text she received was from a male friend living in Paphos. She had visited the country two years earlier with a girlfriend, and had been offered kitchen jobs. She had also spoken about wanting to work with horses in Cyprus.Police sent officers to investigate, but could find no evidence to support the theory. And would Claudia have chosen to disappear just four days before she and Joan were due to meet up for Mother’s Day?Claudia’s father, Peter, told the programme: ‘She wasn’t a mastermind who would have been able to devise a way of going abroad without using a passport or bank account.’Although she and Peter have been estranged for more than 20 years, Joan can’t help but agree.Which leaves the final theory: that Claudia may have been sex-trafficked to Amsterdam and has been held against her will ever since.Mrs Lawrence revealed on the programme that she had received information from a potential witness — originally from York — who claimed to have recognised Claudia at Hartlepool Marina, from which boats travel to Holland.Joan added that she’d heard about ‘some kind of white slave trade going on’. In July 2012, a private detective had also reported seeing Claudia in Amsterdam. However, when Dutch police investigated the lead, they found no trace of her.Today, Joan admits she knows no more about what really happened to Claudia than she did ten years ago. She calls the early police investigation ‘one disaster after another’.         Joan\u0027s favourite Christmas card shows a golden retriever puppy. Claudia loves animals, she saysShe will never understand why North Yorkshire police initially used an old photograph of Claudia with blonde hair in their missing person appeal, when she had changed the colour to brunette.‘I offered them a more up-to-date photograph, but it wasn’t changed for four years, until Dai Malyn took over,’ she says.Joan is now pinning her hopes on the new cold case team investigating the crimes of Halliwell, which is casting fresh eyes over her daughter’s disappearance.She has faith in them — but ever since that early Crimewatch appeal, she says, she has been trying to correct the false impression it left that her daughter was some kind of ‘home-wrecker’ or good-time girl.She believes the appeal served only to drain sympathy for Claudia and alienate potential witnesses.         Police search a nature reserve in York for Claudia after she went missing in March 2009 ‘Why is it always the woman who is judged?’ asks Joan, who insists that Claudia’s love life was no different from that of many other single women.‘You could ask, why are these so-called married men looking for a girl like my daughter? They’re not so innocent, nor do they always let on that they’re married. Everyone who knew Claudia — all her real friends in Malton — didn’t recognise her from how she’d been portrayed.’Privately educated, Claudia grew up with her parents and older sister Ali in the pretty market town of Malton, also in North Yorkshire, where Joan still lives.Her father was a solicitor and before her parents split up in 1996, it was a comfortable upbringing. Claudia played the flute, and on Saturdays the girls would have riding lessons. Claudia’s world revolved around her ponies, Brandy and Cobweb.Joan thought Claudia would make a wonderful veterinary nurse, but after school she decided to go to catering college and loved it, eventually landing a job as a chef at the University of York.Mother and daughter, both vegetarian, were very close and tried to meet up weekly, either for lunch or to go shopping. They spoke on the phone every day.         Police officers enter a terraced property in York as part of the investigation in August 2009Claudia was in the habit of calling her mum for a chat on the walk home from work, and she was last seen alive when CCTV cameras picked her up posting a letter at a postbox not far from her home.Claudia had been single for about 18 months after a long on-off relationship ended, but Joan says she was quite happy on her own.‘She lacked self-confidence from a young age and never thought she was pretty,’ she says. ‘When we walked down the street together, men would always look at her, but she never even noticed.‘She never seemed bothered about getting married or having children, though she loved her two nephews. She told me she was quite happy being single.         Police outside the Nags Head pub in York, which they searched for a second time in June 2009       ‘Claudia loved her job. She liked cooking for people, especially children in the creche. Working unsocial hours, it was quite difficult having a relationship, but she was content with her lot.‘She was serious about her career, even though it wasn’t very well-paid, and she’d never drink during the week when she had an early shift. She didn’t want to take the risk driving the next morning.‘Claudia worked in a male-dominated industry, so most of her friends were inevitably going to be men.‘Yes, she would go and visit them and they were married, but Claudia was friends with their wives, too. I sometimes used to go with her and we’d buy presents for their children. Claudia was a very straightforward person. There was nothing mysterious about it.‘It seemed to me that, in the beginning, every male Claudia knew was being treated as a potential suspect by police. Who would want to risk coming forward? But with the new team, it’s different.’So what does Joan think happened to Claudia?‘Who’s to say she isn’t living somewhere, perhaps married with children, but unable to contact us for whatever reason?’ she says.‘I just don’t know. It’s all speculation. But someone knows the truth, and my teenage grandsons, Claudia’s nephews, keep telling me, “Don’t give up, Gran. Keep going.”‘After ten years it doesn’t get any easier. Every Christmas I long to buy my daughter presents, just like every other mum.‘But I can’t, can I?’ "},{"url":null,"title":"The unlikely tail Indian monkeys ancient fresco","story":"Share this article Her research has not yet shown how the artist might have come across one of the animals. It is possible that the artist might have seen a langur while travelling in Asia, or that one of the monkeys could have been brought to south-eastern Europe.  The frescoes date back to the Minoan civilisation, which was based in Crete but spread across Greek islands such as Santorini. The blue monkeys are among numerous pieces of Minoan art preserved in the Bronze Age settlement of Akrotiri. Known as the \u0027Pompeii of the Aegean\u0027, the prehistoric town was buried under thick layers of volcanic ash during an eruption 3,700 years ago.           Long distance: The scientist\u0027s research has shown that the animals in the Santorini drawing came from 3,000 miles away in what is now Pakistan         Pointing up: Dr Pareja said she had spoken to biologists to establish that the monkeys in the Santorini fresco were in fact langurs (file photo) native to the Indian subcontinent         Pointing down: Biologists said the animals in the drawings could not have been monkeys native to Africa or the Middle East, such as this vervet monkey At the time, the Indus Valley civilisation was a powerful presence on the subcontinent, a rival of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Some Indus Valley towns, which first appeared around 5,000 years ago, were home to tens of thousands of people. The civilisation used standardized weights and measures, built major roads and traded with places as far away as East Africa. It was largely forgotten in the West until the 19th century, when explorers began discovering its ruins on the subcontinent. Even today, knowledge about the civilisation is limited by the fact that its Harappan language is yet to be deciphered.    Researchers at the University of Nottingham say the Silk Road was a network of long-distance trade routes between ancient Europe and China. \u0027It was a conduit for humans, languages, objects and diseases and is a fascinating example of international cross-boundary interaction that has mutually enriched the cultures of Eurasia and Africa for at least 2000 years,\u0027 they say. \u0027This led to the exchange of ideas that triggered new scientific and technological developments, and modified languages.\u0027  Curious tail of monkeys who crossed the ancient world | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Ive wrong says Manchester City fan accused racism","story":"Share this articleShare this articleManchester City fan arrested over alleged racist gestures at derby says he has \u0027done nothing wrong\u0027 - Manchester Evening News"},{"url":null,"title":"Workman left stuck legs wrapped round lamppost mates prank him","story":"Share this article The prank is best pulled off by convincing someone to straddle a lamppost before lowering them to the ground with their legs crossed. Unless the victim has extreme upper body strength, they must be lifted out of the position by two other people. The prank should not be attempted without people on hand to get the victim out of the position.It dates back to the World War II and is derived from a restraint technique called The Grape Vine used by special forces. After 15 minutes in the unbearable position, cramp sets in, causing the person to release their hands to relieve the pain. This puts pressure on the rib cage and restricts breathing, which causes the person to pass out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"CEO Steph Korey luxury suitcase start Away steps down","story":"Share this article          Korey (seen in an Instagram picture above) will remain on the company\u0027s Board of Directors as Executive Chairman         In a press release on Monday, Away said the new CEO appointment was due to the \u0027immense growth\u0027 of the brandOne employee described having to turn her car around as she made her way to the airport to take a family Thanksgiving break because she was watching one of her team members being eviscerated by Korey on Slack. \u0027Slack bullying is a thing\u0027, said a former employee, known as Erica. \u0027In my experience there, it\u0027s extensive and relentless.

As well as taking away about half of the surviving sculptures before eventually selling them to the British Museum, Elgin also employed specialist craftsmen to create detailed plaster casts of many of the artworks that he left behind on the great Athens monument.Now analysis of those casts has revealed details that have since been lost on the original sculptures, casting fresh light on an almost forgotten technique that could reveal further insights about some of the most celebrated monuments in classical art.Research by Dr Emma Payne, a specialist in classics and archaeological conservation based at King’s College London, shows that in 1802, when Elgin’s men made their casts, the sculptures of the west frieze of the Parthenon were in markedly better condition than they are today.“Elgin’s casts could be important records of the state of the sculptures in the very early 19th century before modern pollution would hasten their deterioration,” said Payne.By comparing the casts with present-day 3D scans of the west frieze – which was removed from the monument in 1993 and is now in the Acropolis Museum in Athens – she revealed features that are now lost, including the faces of some of the sculptures, and chisel marks showing they had intentionally been chipped away by Victorian-era vandals.While it has long been known that the casts preserve some lost sections, Payne’s research showed that the copies were more accurate than expected, with most of the casts deviating by barely a millimetre from the originals.As a result, she showed that Elgin’s copies are the best-preserved 3D record of what Dr Ian Jenkins, a senior curator of ancient Greece at the British Museum, says came to be considered “the most beautiful manmade sculptures on earth”.Payne also analysed a second set of casts, commissioned by the British Museum in 1872. She was able to show that more damage was caused in the intervening seven decades than in the 120 years that followed, meaning that a century of traffic pollution did less harm than Victorian vandals. Her research is published in Antiquity magazine.Payne’s scans also confirm that in some cases, the people who created the Elgin moulds had attempted to recreate pieces that were already missing by that time, resulting in some crude additions.Payne told the  she had been surprised by how accurate her computer-aided analysis had shown the copies to be. “Certainly the results very much emphasise the skill of the casters, and it shows that there is still information that we can potentially learn about the Parthenon sculptures from these 19th-century studies that haven’t really been looked at in detail.”Notably, she said, other large excavations of the period, including at Delphi and Olympia, had also made moulds of the artworks they uncovered – which could potentially yield their own secrets.Payne said: “This work helps us to understand the important role that such casts can still play as 3D time capsules, but we need to study them very closely to understand exactly what it is they preserve.”Asked if a fresh recognition of the casts’ value might lessen the controversy around Elgin’s involvement, Jenkins said: “I am all in favour of Lord Elgin’s rescue of the sculptures, and I do think that this recording of the west frieze is all part of a great sense of reverence for the ancient past.”Unusually, he said, the names of the cast-makers had been recorded where those of other skilled craftsmen were not “because they were seen to be producing something which was essentially art”.The temple had already suffered significant damage by the time Elgin made his casts. It was damaged by fire in the 3rd century AD, and some sculptures were deliberately damaged when it was converted to a church in the early Christian era, around AD600. By the 13th century it had been converted to a mosque by the Ottomans, and in 1687 was being used as a gunpowder store when an explosion caused significant damage to parts of the building.

Three decades ago he used one of these lockers to store all his belongings. He was broke, unemployed and homeless in the city. His life, he writes, had become “only something to survive, and for that I had no one to blame but myself and my accomplices: alcohol, cocaine and a deep-seated streak of what my old Greek philosophy professor would call akrasia – a weakness of will that allows one to act against one’s better judgement”.Born to working-class parents in Brooklyn, he had graduated from Dartmouth. At 22, he was married to his high-school girlfriend and working as a copy editor at Harcourt Brace in New York. He dreamed of publishing his first novel by the time he was 25. But there is a rift between one’s dreams and one’s deeds that Kaldheim tried to bridge by staying past happy hour every evening in the West Village. His wife left him after she found out he had been cheating. He quit Harcourt and became an acquisitions editor at another publishing firm. The new job came with a pay rise that he again squandered on his drinking. He developed a taste for speed and cocaine, and resigned from his job after spectacularly failing to meet a deadline. Kaldheim landed in prison in Rikers Island after selling coke to an undercover agent. He got married again and lost his wife to a brain aneurysm during a trial separation. By the time he was homeless in his mid-30s, he was spending his nights hopping from bar to bar, drinking and “freelance dealing”. When he realised he was too deep in debt to a violent drug boss, he decided to get out of the city. He abandoned all his clothes in the locker at Penn Station, fleeced a customer for cash one last time and caught a Greyhound bus to Richmond, Virginia, even as a terrible blizzard kept other New Yorkers indoors.Idiot Wind is Kaldheim’s record of that escape from New York, a journey that ends, eight months and 5,000 miles later, when he finds a job at last as a cook in Montana. Along the way, he lives from one meal to the next, hitching rides across 20 state lines, hopping trains, donating blood plasma for cash, scrounging for leftovers in bins, spending countless nights in the open. He isn’t shy about making his influences apparent – during stopovers, he reads Jack Kerouac’s On the Road and George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London in public libraries – but the book is animated by Kaldheim’s resolution that his dissolute days are behind him. In Richmond he meets a single mother working through her drug habit to regain custody of her daughter. He drives around a town all night in North Carolina with an heir to a property fortune relapsing from his medication. A Vietnam-era veteran reveals his battle scars to Kaldheim when he sees traffic helicopters hovering around a road accident. He hitchhikes across the Mississippi with a teenager who has run away from home after losing his mother to cancer.These encounters are not cautionary tales. To Kaldheim, they reinforce a sense of fellowship that he realises he had been hankering after in New York. Acts of both unexpected kindness and lingering bitterness offer him a conceivably headier fix: the romance of being involved, however fleetingly, in someone else’s life. The people he runs into on the road are also recovering in one way or another. Wars, drugs and years of economic turmoil have simultaneously opened up and narrowed their worlds. The uncertainty is embodied in the movies they seem to like, including those by Nicholas Ray and David Lynch. Their music – Bob Dylan, ZZ Top, Rahsaan Roland Kirk – reflects back to them their self-image of being constantly at a sort of crossroads in their lives.Although it is a memoir set in the Reagan years, the milieu still feels so contemporary. We know those cheap windowless hotel rooms that come furnished with a “sagging bed” and the “obligatory four-drawer dresser, with two missing drawer-pulls and a cherrywood top whose edges were deckled black with cigarette burns”. We’ve noticed the “freelance dealers” who wander from bar to bar looking desperate every night. Cashless, and without a place to go, we’ve all spent some mornings in public libraries. For those vulnerable and stranded in the US, certain things appear to have remained unchanged. Too many of us still have to resort to the Penn Station luggage lockers.• Idiot Wind is published by Canongate (RRP £14.99). To buy a copy go to bookshop.

Why?by  Daniel Lavelle and  Simon HattenstoneOn 8 July, Police Scotland issued a statement: “Police are appealing for the assistance of the public in tracing relatives of 53-year-old Mark David James Starr, who was found dead within the Glasgow Green area of Glasgow on 28 June 2019.” Starr was homeless and had been sleeping rough in Glasgow’s oldest city park. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances, although the cause of death has not yet been determined.Three weeks later, another appeal was issued. “Officers believe Mr Starr may have relatives in the Kent area, but have been unable to track down any family members despite a previous appeal on 8 July.” It seemed like one of those horribly familiar stories – homeless man dies alone, with no one to miss or mourn him.“We didn’t find out till five weeks after Mark died. And then it was on social media,” says Mark’s mother, Sue. She looks at her daughter, Karen. “One of your friends saw it on Facebook didn’t she, and texted you.”“Yeah, she said: ‘This isn’t your Mark, is it?’” Karen says. “I couldn’t believe it.”“I still can’t believe it,” Sue says. “Well, you don’t ever imagine one of your children is going to end up in that situation, do you? He always told me he was doing fine in Glasgow.” Silence.They sound numb. Both are still in shock. It’s September, barely a month since they heard the news, and only a week since Mark Starr’s funeral in his home town, Ashford, Kent. Sue and Karen tell us about the service. Four old friends carried the coffin, and they played some of Mark’s favourite songs: Bitter Sweet Symphony, Like a Rolling Stone, He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother – all of them painfully apt.We meet at a cafe in Ashford town centre. Karen is shy and withdrawn Sue is open and talkative, and even in her grief she wheezes with laughter at some of the things Humpy got up to. Humpy is Mark. That’s the nickname his older brother, Tony, gave him when he was a little boy because he always got the hump. Somebody would take his ball or he would go fishing and catch nothing, and Mark would strop off for a couple of hours. But he always came back. He loved his nickname, and had it tattooed on his arm. It was his only tattoo.726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and  Cities\u0026nbspwill look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths.\u0026nbspAs the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all.\u0026nbspIt is time to stop just passing by.Mark was born two months premature, weighing just three and a half pounds. “We didn’t think he’d survive,” Sue says. “I was going to call him Jason. I just liked the name. But the priest came to see me and said: ‘I think we better get the baby christened straight away,’ and I couldn’t think straight. He suggested Mark, ’cos he was a saint.” After a month, Mark began to thrive and Sue was allowed to leave hospital.The Starrs were a close family, but nobody was closer to Mark than Tony. He isn’t here today because he has taken his brother’s death so badly. “We used to get the school bus together and the driver called us the Three Musketeers because we always looked out for each other,” Karen says. Sue and Karen have brought photos with them. There are pictures of Mark eating a toffee apple in Hastings, holding a tiny monkey, camping with friends in Wales.“I don’t think they washed all week!” Sue says. Her laughter sets off her hacking smoker’s cough. Like all the family, Sue sounds cockney even though she was born and bred in Kent. She tells us about the rosettes Mark won for showjumping. “There was a time we thought he would be a jockey. He was really good.” But as with so much, he lost interest.There are so many stories about Mark – most of them involving the outdoors, and things going hopelessly wrong. There was the time he went camping and the tent blew away in the middle of the night because they hadn’t secured it properly the school trip when he got lost the visit to Luton to watch George Best when he and Tony got on the corrugated iron roof and fell through it. He was a happy, fearless boy, they say.Mark left school at 15 without qualifications. “He was never going to be a scholar,” Sue says. “His reports always said: ‘Could do well, but lacks concentration.’” He got a job assisting a gamekeeper. The problem was he didn’t bother turning up to work. “He did come clean in the end,” Sue says. “He was just hanging out with his mates. You always thought he was listening to you, but he wasn’t really.” Nothing appeared to worry him, she says. And that’s what stopped her worrying about him – for a while.A few weeks later we meet Tony Starr with Sue in Ashford. With red hair stretching down his back and a lived-in face, Tony looks like an ageing rock star. His early memories of Mark are idyllic – fishing with their father every Sunday, floating down the river on homemade rafts, crabbing on the beach, listening to nightingales in the woods, hanging off cliffs to collect birds’ eggs. “Not a care in the world, mate,” he says. “We’d take a few jam sandwiches when we were thirsty we drank river water! Humpy was a good fisher. You made your own entertainment in them days. We weren’t stuck in front of a screen eight hours a day.”But the more he talks about his brother, the more complex the character that emerges. As a young boy, Mark had terrible nightmares. “He’d wake up in the night, proper screaming. We never understood why. I’d just pick a slipper up and throw it at him. ‘Shut up Humpy.’ One night we were hanging out in the back garden, in a tent, camping out, and Humpy was screaming in his sleep. The neighbour jumped over the fence. He thought we were being attacked. Humpy always sucked his thumb. Even into his late 30s, he sucked his thumb.”Rather than being carefree, it sounds more like Mark simply didn’t care, so he would steal packets of Chewits as a kid and not worry about being chased by the shop owner, and years later would drive without having passed his test. Sue talks about the time his grandmother needed a lift and Mark called for her in a little white van. When Mark’s grandmother complained that it was cold and asked him if the windows were open, he replied there were no windows. “I said to Mark: ‘You’ve not got a licence, you can’t keep doing this.’ ‘I don’t need a licence,’ he said.” That was always his attitude – he didn’t need the paperwork, didn’t need to follow rules, didn’t need money or a job – he would get by.And, for a time, he did. His family still say he never seemed unhappy. He had plenty of friends, and was popular with women. In his early 20s, he moved in with his girlfriend, Rebecca. “She was stunning,” Tony says. “Honest to God, she’d make Page 3 girls look ordinary. I thought: you’re punching above your weight there, Hump. But Rebecca only had eyes for him. They’d been friends as kids – she was a bit of a wild child.”Tony says Mark and Rebecca started to take cannabis, and progressed from there. Before long they were injecting heroin. Then one day Mark woke up, and Rebecca was dead in bed next to him. She was 24. “He never recovered from that,” Tony says. “A part of him never came back.”Even then his parents didn’t know he was addicted to heroin. Mark returned to the family home, and one day his father found a syringe in his bedroom. Mark told his father, a concrete finisher on building sites, that it wasn’t his syringe. “And his dad said: ‘Well, it’s not mine or Mum’s or Tony’s or Karen’s. Don’t treat me like a fool, it’s got to be yours,’” Sue says. Tony remembers how distraught their father was that day. “We had a few chickens back then. I went down to see my dad and he was in tears, looking at the chickens. Blank face. I’d never seen my dad like that. He was just so sad about it.”After Rebecca’s death, Mark lost three more people he loved: his aunt Elsie, who used to take the Starr children on holiday every summer and was known in the family for making the best chips in Kent his best friend, Martin (another drug addict) and his father, who died suddenly 20 years ago, when he was still working on building sites. “Humpy took it bad. Dad adored all of us, but Humpy was his favourite. And Humpy loved Dad.”As time went on, Mark became less and less functional. He served a few short prison sentences for shoplifting and then three years of a five-year term for attempting to import 60g of heroin in his pants. Even when he was in jail he told his family that he was doing just fine. Sue reads a letter Mark sent from Elmley prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, soon after arriving there. “The food’s OK. Send my love to everyone. Tell Aunt Elsie I’m OK and not to worry … see you both in a couple of months. Lots of love, Mark.”He came out of prison, tried to beat his addiction and failed. But still his family insist he didn’t seem to have a care in the world. He had a council flat in Ashford and would pop round every day to Karen’s for a cooked breakfast. Tony says he never forgot a birthday, would always trim his grandmother’s hedge, and that he was a wonderful uncle to Tony’s son, Jude. “Humpy thought the world of my boy. He’d come round for Sunday dinner and straight afterwards he’d say: ‘Come on, Jude, let’s go out and have a game of football.’ When Eminem came over he got a photo signed by him. God knows where he got it from.”Despite the acts of generosity, Mark’s life became more and more chaotic. He would disappear for long periods of time without telling the family. Tony went round to his flat one day and was shocked to see drug paraphernalia everywhere. “It was like needle city. I went mad. I said: ‘You silly bugger. Leave that stuff alone, it’s a one-way ticket to misery.’ But it was like talking to a brick wall. I said: ‘Humpy mate, they are going to get rid of you’, and they did. They evicted him.”It was about eight years ago that Mark was evicted from his flat in Ashford. There were times he stayed with Tony and Sue, and times he lived on the streets. Tony says some local people treated Mark with contempt. “Kids used to throw water over him. He got no help in Ashford. He was frowned upon.” He would stay with Tony, but after a few days he would find it claustrophobic. “Then he’d just go. He couldn’t stay in one place.” Over the years Mark became delusional. Neither Tony nor Sue believe he got the support he needed. “There ain’t no mental health these days,” Tony says. “It’s all shot to pieces.”Four years ago, Mark upped and left Ashford. Again, he didn’t give his family warning. “Eventually he phoned me up and I said: ‘Where are you, Mark?’ And he said: ‘I’m in Scotland,’” Sue recalls. “I said: ‘What are you doing up there?’ He said: ‘It’s lovely here, and the people here are lovely.’ He said he was staying in a hostel. I was looking after my mum who had dementia and couldn’t be left, and he phoned up and said: ‘You and nan will have to come up for a holiday when I’ve got my own place. It’s really good up here. I’m happy.’ I said: ‘Thank goodness for that.’” Then he told them he did have his own place. And Sue says she really was convinced he was thriving.However, on his occasional returns to Ashford, Mark seemed to be anything but thriving. His mental health had deteriorated and his delusions had got worse. “One time he said: ‘I’ve got to go, I’m meeting Jay-Z and Beyoncé tonight,’” Tony says. “I said: ‘Have a nice time, Hump.’ Then he’d tell us that Roman Abramovich had lent him his yacht.”Did he say things like this when he lived in Ashford? “Yeah, but it just got worse,” Sue says. “One of the last times he came down, he said: ‘I met Rebecca and Dad up town and they’re coming back.’” She doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry, so she does a bit of both. “That’s when I knew how ill he was. He really believed it.”Occasionally he told Tony the truth. “We’d be up till six or seven in the morning just chatting about old times and chewing the fat, and he’d say: ‘You don’t know what it’s like to go in bins and search for food.’ That really kicked the stomach out of me to think he had to do that.” Sue shakes her head. “He never said anything like that to me. He always made out he was all right up there.” “He weren’t,” Tony tells her gently. “He weren’t, Mum.” Sue says she still doesn’t understand why Mark went to Scotland. Tony tells her Mark said that people like him were better supported in Glasgow than Ashford.As with the rest of Britain, there is a homelessness crisis in Scotland. Shelter Scotland figures show that in 2018-19, 36,465 homeless applications were made and 29,894 households were assessed as homeless by their local authority. In Glasgow, 5,679 homeless applications were made in 2018-19, from a population of 608,000. But Scotland is also making a serious attempt to address its crisis. The country is piloting Housing First in five of its biggest cities, based on models that have been used successfully in places as erse as Finland and New York. Housing First is founded on the principle that people with complex needs are provided with a home and wraparound services at the same time. It is, though, a slow and expensive process. In Glasgow, the hope is that, over five years, 600 people will be taken off the streets or out of emergency accommodation and provided with homes.In March, it was revealed that 139 people had died in Scotland on the streets or in temporary or supported homeless accommodation over the past 18 months. One thing that devastates the Starr family is how long it took them to find out that Mark was dead. Tony says Police Scotland was efficient and supportive. It contacted Kent police immediately to inform them about Mark. And that’s when things went awry. Kent police turned up at the doorstep of Sue’s house, but by then she was living with a friend. The person now living in Sue’s house has since told her that he passed her new address to the police. But the police never got in touch with her. When she heard that Kent police were looking for her, she phoned them, but was told by an officer that he knew nothing about the matter.It is early September, more than two months since Mark died, and Kent police has still not spoken to the family, let alone apologised (though it does a couple of months later). Tony says this has made the grieving process much more painful. He feels he never got the chance to say a proper goodbye to his brother.Tony decides to come to Scotland with us to find out more about Mark’s final months. He hopes it might provide the family with some kind of closure. Sue says she would find it too upsetting, but is glad he is doing it on the family’s behalf. What is she hoping he will find out? “It’s a silly question, really, but was he happy up there?” She smiles. “It’s a strange thing to say isn’t it? Happy on the street. But I know he was happy there sometimes.”It is early morning in mid-October, and we’re on the train to Glasgow. Tony has already cracked open a few cans of heavy-duty lager. It’s hard to know whether it’s dutch courage or habit. Sometimes, he says, he will only drink a couple of cans in a day sometimes many more. He likes to smoke cannabis, too, but has never used class A drugs. He’s terrified of them – he saw what they did to Mark.Tony has also had a tough life. He has anxiety and depression, and says that, in his 20s, there was a year after a relationship ended when he could barely set foot outside his house. When he and Jude’s mother split up, he looked after Jude. In December 2003, two people turned up at his house demanding that he hand over Jude. Tony refused and was stabbed in the face. One of the assailants was subsequently jailed, and the incident left Tony with post-traumatic stress disorder. Soon after the attack, Tony won custody of Jude.Tony has not worked since then, and has struggled financially. There have been times, he says, when it could easily have been him homeless as well as Mark. “I’ve had letters saying: ‘We’re going to evict you.’ It can happen to anybody. It’s really scary. Two years ago, there was a mix-up with the council, I fell briefly behind with rent and they went straight to eviction proceedings.”Tony is feeling emotional. He says he had to make this trip because Mark would have done the same for him. He takes out a photo – the last picture taken of the two brothers. Tony is topless, and they both look a little the worse for wear. “He was a bit bony by then. You know my last memory of Humpy is him walking down the path and me saying: ‘I love you, Hump.’ He said: ‘I love you too, bruv.’ That’s the last words I said to Humpy. I had a sixth sense something was going to happen. I told a few friends, I’m going to get a phone call soon.”He is also thinking about the good times, not all of them from childhood. Six years ago, they saw the Rolling Stones play in Hyde Park – one of the best days of their life, he says. “We were stood in a posh pub in our shorts smoking a joint. I think we got away with it ’cos the Stones were playing. We went to some blinding concerts, but that was the best. Unbelievable. It was the last concert we went to. I’ll cherish that memory.” He opens another can. “There’s only one Humpy Starr, believe me. He was unique.”“Excuse me, love, you don’t recognise this fella, do you? It’s my brother.” Tony kneels down to talk to a young homeless woman on the street – a girl really. He shows her the picture. She doesn’t recognise him, but they chat for a couple of minutes. It’s almost midnight, and the street homeless people of Glasgow are bedding down for the night.Tony approaches a skinny man with a red pointy beard. Barry, who is in his late 30s, has been living on the streets for the best part of 20 years and looks like a cross between Billy Connolly and Worzel Gummidge. He doesn’t recognise Mark either, but he forms an instant bond with Tony. Barry says he would rather be on the streets than in the hostels because they are loud, dirty and violent.“How d’you cope? Blimey, you must be battle hardened by now, Barry?” Tony says.“Aye, I’m used to it. There have been a lot of deaths when it’s been cold, but cold doesnae bother me. Some of the public can be all right, but you’ve also got the ones that walk past and spit on you. You need to find somewhere safe at night in case a crowd come and set on you.”Semra says she has been turned away from a hostel for being abusive, but insists she was just bantering with a friend. She has been homeless for some time, but this is her first night on the street and she’s terrified. “They told me to sleep under a camera so I can’t be murdered. What fucking chance have I got?” She pauses, and looks at Tony. “You can see the sadness in your eyes. You can see the hurt. I’m so sorry for your loss.”Tony says her account of Mark rings true. “He didn’t really drink, but he did like his crack.” Most important to Tony, she said Mark was a good man.Soon after getting to Glasgow, we receive a call from the council press office – just guidance, they say. They tell us that Mark did have accommodation, but he was evicted twice – once after uncapped needles were found in his temporary home, and another time for being aggressive. Tony is upset when I tell him the news. He says he has never known Mark to be aggressive. Yes, he says, he would fight back if provoked, but that’s all.Shelter Scotland call us to say it has information that may be of interest to Tony. We rush over to its offices, where we meet the community hub manager Davy MacIver and the senior development worker Stephen Wishart. They make for a good double act – MacIver small and quietly spoken, Wishart big and combative.“For about a week he was sleeping rough and couldn’t get accommodated again,” says MacIver. “That’s when we come in. We would have assisted him with his legal requirement to accommodation.” On another occasion he was gatekept after giving up a temporary furnished flat when he had started hearing voices. Again, the council failed to provide him with emergency accommodation. Shelter says the last time it saw him, it helped him find accommodation, but it didn’t see him in the final month of his life, and doesn’t know how he ended up back on the streets. He was due to meet Shelter on 28 June for help with his personal independence payment claim. He didn’t turn up. That was the day he died, a day before his 54th birthday.Tony asks whether there is any reference to violent behaviour in the case notes. “No,” Wishart says. “He doesn’t seem to be one of the clients who have been asked to leave places for violence … it was never an issue. But I’ve seen people asked to leave these places for cheek rather than aggression, and we’re told it’s aggression. But then when you look at it, it’s someone telling them to F-off.”Tony tells them his mother wants to know whether Mark was happy in Glasgow. He knows the answer, but he still feels he has to ask on behalf of Sue. “I wouldn’t say he seemed unhappy, if that makes sense,” Wishart says. “Given his circumstances, he was engaging. We get a lot of angry people in here, but Mark wasn’t like that. He was never up, never down, always even. Mark was a nice guy.”Tony mentions that the council said he had been evicted for leaving uncapped needles on the floor of his flat. MacIver gives a despairing look. “Private accommodation providers aren’t set up to cope with the situations they’re having to deal with,” he says. “Their response is to have a zero-tolerance policy because that’s the only thing they can effectively manage. You need properly resourced providers with specialist provision. Private landlords are not going to do the trick.”They talk about the Housing First model being rolled out gradually across Glasgow, and say it’s wonderful – in principle. “Housing First is actually designed for people like Mark,” Wishart says. “Yet I sit in meetings and hear about people being too complex for Housing First. So what are they not too complex for? Or are they just never to have a house? Is that it? OK, well, let’s just throw the towel in because we’re in the wrong game. Anyway, don’t get me started.” But it’s too late. Wishart is fuming.What would victory look like in the battle against the council? “That’s easy to answer,” says Wishart. “That people like Mark who approach the local authority and make a homeless application and ask for emergency accommodation, they get it.”Tony is impressed by their passion – and the fact that Mark may be one of the test cases in the legal action. As we leave, he makes an impromptu speech in praise of Scotland. “I’m thankful for what you’ve told me. Humpy was born in England, but died a son of Scotland. He loved the Glasgow people. I’ve only been here a day, but I can see why. I’ll be coming back.”Wherever we go we bump into Barry on the streets, and he’s brimming with ideas about where Tony might find people who knew Mark. He suggests we visit the City Mission day centre. At night its building serves as emergency accommodation for homeless people. The main hall is packed with people chatting at tables, eating and playing pool. Margaret, a middle-aged woman with a kindly, prematurely aged face, smiles affectionately when she sees the photo of Mark. “He was lonesome,” she tells Tony. “Me and my pals would sit next to him and talk to him. I talked to him all the time. He’d say: ‘I’m down.’ It was sad.”Tony asks her if Mark was a drinker? Tony seems to use the answer as a gauge of reliability. “No,” Margaret says. “He just liked the one can.” He asks what it’s like to sleep rough. “It’s horrible. People sleep under bridges by Central station and people spit on them and kick them. A guy got stabbed last week on the other side of the bridge. It’s dangerous, aye. Dangerous.” Tony hugs her as we leave.The next day we meet SNP councillor Mhairi Hunter, Glasgow city council’s convener for health and social care. Hunter says she is proud of the homelessness work the council is doing with Housing First, and explains how radical it is because homeless people no longer need to prove themselves “tenancy ready” when they move in. However admirable the model, it means little to Tony, and he can no longer hold back.“We found out by law my brother should have been housed,” Tony says.“Three times he had to find somewhere to live and he was on the streets.”“I can’t talk in detail about your brother’s case, but there can be circumstances where people get asked to leave accommodation,” Hunter says.“See, I’m thinking if my brother had been put somewhere and he got help that he needed, he could still be alive today.”Hunter nods silently. Would she accept that the council has failed to fulfil its duty to homeless people? “A hundred per cent,” she says. “Those figures are provided by us, and it’s part of our system to record every instance where somebody isn’t accommodated.”She says the SNP-run council is making progress, but Shelter hasn’t given it enough time. “You can’t just shut the system down and reboot it. It has to happen incrementally. That’s why it’s a five-year plan. I would absolutely not say our homelessness systems are fit for purpose because I know they are not.”Hunter has a point. The very fact that it is unlawful to deny homeless people temporary accommodation in Scotland is a sign of how seriously it takes the issue. As is the fact that Glasgow city council itself provides figures for the number of times it has failed to accommodate people in temporary accommodation – the stick with which Shelter can beat it. But the bottom line, as Hunter acknowledges, is that the council has acted unlawfully.It’s a beautiful, cold, fresh day in Glasgow Green. Tony has brought Mark’s ashes to scatter over the Nelson Monument, close to where he died. He opens the box, throws them into the air and breaks down. “There you go, Hump. There you go, bruv.” He kisses the memorial and crosses himself. “I love you, Hump. God bless you, brother. Will you keep a space for me up there, Humpy? Take care, bruv. I love you.”After gathering himself, he phones Sue to tell her he has scattered Mark’s ashes. She asks him what he has found out about Mark’s time in Glasgow. He tells her that he has met people who knew him, and that they have only good things to say about him. He doesn’t say anything about whether Mark was happy here in his final days.When he puts the phone down, he tells us he has been shocked to discover the life Mark was leading. “I didn’t think he’d go downhill like this. I really didn’t. He had a hard life up here – on his own, a lot of the time wandering around the streets, freezing cold, soaking wet, nothing to eat, treated like a dog, really.” And yet, despite everything, he says something positive has come out of this. “Walking in Humpy’s footsteps, I felt closer to him,” he says. “Being with the homeless in Glasgow has been very humbling. After hearing some of the stories. I can’t believe the kindness they show.”What was he expecting? “To be honest, I was expecting: ‘No, I don’t want to talk to you, F-off.’ No one said that. I just think of Humpy being on a park bench somewhere, freezing cold, and Margaret turning up with her friends and trying to cheer him up. Some of the public think they’re the dregs of society, yet they’ve got more kindness, more resilience, more compassion ... they’re unbelievable.”As we head back south, Tony opens a can of lager. There is so much to tell the family, he says. No, he can’t say Mark died happy or comfortably, but he thinks he can tell them something equally important. He talks about the Shelter case, and sitting in Mhairi Hunter’s office telling her that Mark might still be here if the council had done right by him. And he talks about the possibility of Mark being cited as evidence that the council did not fulfil its statutory duty to the homeless people of Glasgow. He knows his family will continue to grieve for Mark, but maybe, just maybe, something good will come of his death. “If Humpy stops more people dying on the streets by holding the council to account,” he says, “then his death won’t have been in vain.”Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.orgIf you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application.

But that’s not how democracy is supposed to workThe general election has been portrayed from all sides as a landmark encounter. Since it was called, all the talk has been of its standalone status. The leaders of the main parties have called it “the most important in a generation”, a “once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country”, something that will “decide the future of our country for generations”, and so on. Talking up the stakes of the moment may be standard rhetoric, but here it seems symptomatic of something deeper, a tendency to see the election as a singular event that will decide matters of unique significance.An air of finality pervades contemporary politics. That the election feels so decisive in part reflects a growing sense of the irreversibility of political decisions – that they are crucial because they are hard to revisit. International trade and economic regulation are often opposed in these terms: resistance to Nafta, Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, EU membership, or post-Brexit trade deals tends to focus on how such arrangements lock in policies as legal commitments. Fears about the future of the NHS are less about underfunding – something later governments could reverse – than the prospect of irredeemable damage, in the form of its opening to US corporations.Contemporary capitalism more generally is widely recognised to entrench power and wealth inequalities, and as its processes accelerate and change becomes exponential, each opportunity to tame it can seem like the last. Climate crisis concerns compound this, with the suggestion that a climate emergency leaves no time for bad choices. And for those who identify with the status quo, just the possibility of a leftwing government breaking taboos around public spending and border management gives the election a momentous quality. Faced with the prospect of irreversible changes, all politics takes on an ultimate feel.It is striking how the discourse around this election has resembled that of a referendum. Referendums are commonly packaged as unique opportunities – chances to settle an issue indefinitely, not to be repeated to a foreseeable timetable. Such things were said of the 2016 Brexit referendum, also of the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, described at the time by the leader of the Scottish Nationalists, as “a once in a generation, perhaps even a once in a lifetime, opportunity for Scotland”. Referendums on membership questions especially tend to be cast as moments of reckoning. British politics has been living in the shadow of these, and the outlook seems to have rubbed off on the election.This is a departure from how modern democracy tends to be rationalised. Arguably the whole point of elections is that they recur. They form a repeating sequence that extends into an open future, consistent with the thought that public opinion changes, decisions should be reversible, all victories are provisional, and democracy is a process rather than an event. The notion of a conclusive encounter seems to belong elsewhere – in the domain of warfare for instance, where military commanders may seek out the decisive battle. A decisive battle implies a decisive victor. The concept comes laden with a yearning for clarity and the ultimate test, and for an end to conflict and a lasting settlement. Modern democracy, by contrast, has been built on the idea of the indecisive battle – its periodic structures are a way of avoiding the finality of military victory. It imposes the features of cyclical time onto the linear structure of unfolding history.When elections take on a standalone significance, certain aspects come to the fore. As in many a referendum, campaign tactics in this election have been thoroughly dirty on the part of some, based on misinformation and propaganda. When everything is supposed to hinge on a decisive clash, the temptation is to pursue victory at all costs. This is shaped in part by who leads the campaigns. Note the reliance of the Conservatives on short-term appointees, many drawn from the 2016 leave campaign. Such transitory figures have short temporal horizons, being hired to secure victory in the contest at hand. They are mercenaries rather than partisans, soon to move on. The Labour party has been largely alone in tying its campaign to a long-term ideological programme, in defining itself by a manifesto.Party identities are easily corroded when an election takes on a unique significance. Those who have called for temporary alliances between remain or leave parties imply the demands of the moment outweigh long-standing ideological traditions. With pacts in place between the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens on the one side, the Conservatives and Brexit party on the other, one sees blocs that are artefacts of the moment, constituted for the single encounter. They define themselves less by enduring party identities and detailed manifestos than by reassertions of their position on a single question.Crystallised in these features are electoral transformations that go well beyond Brexit. Across western democracy, parties rise and fall at high speed as citizens question their allegiances. Long-term tendencies towards professionalisation, laid bare in times of hardship, have left many parties detached from a wider social base. For some, on the left especially, this spells the need to rebuild as a movement. But it is not a model that all parties can follow, and is difficult even in the best of cases. For politicians who doubt their capacity to mobilise supporters for the long haul, it makes sense to approach elections as one-off events and employ tactics that promise short-term success. The fragmentation of support leaves many dependent on alliances: suppressing their party identities and emphasising the one-off stakes of the moment may help build acceptance of the compromises required.For all their significance and the feeling around these totemic political events, “one-off” clashes are rarely decisive, whether in modern politics or modern war. As becomes obvious on the morning after an election, the struggle is ongoing. Losses can be avenged or assuaged, while gains need to be defended and improved on. An election is not just an opportunity to win power, but to begin the process of mobilisation needed thereafter. In these last days before the vote, amid the final push to get people to the ballot box, it is worth retaining that counter-perspective in which the election is but a point in a process – not least in case the outcome is bad. In the words credited to Labour MP Tony Benn: “There is no final victory, as there is no final defeat. There is just the same battle, to be fought over and over again.”One thing is surely positive, though, about the willingness to see elections as decisive encounters. It reflects an awareness that there are alternatives to the status quo and choices to be made. Only when there are parties competing on something more than varieties of managerialism can elections be seen as turning points. The re-emergence of a programmatic left raises the electoral stakes, and encourages anticipation on all sides of a showdown. Although this is a clash that can have no end, it is one that a few years ago seemed hard to conceive.• Jonathan White is professor of politics at the London School of Economics and author of Politics of Last Resort: Governing by Emergency in the European Union"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9457a4e96c5a7572ba4e2c1fc4496d430e83a00e/0_892_5181_3108/master/5181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8385101226b8861d6ceb95c729115787","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of bake","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘bake’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘bake’.Share your photos of what bake means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 11 December at 10am.

It is only the second bird in history to recover from being extinct in the wild, after the California condor.Other species to have their status updated include the echo parakeet, of which there are now more than 750 in the wild, leading to a reclassification as a “vulnerable” species, having been critically endangered more than a decade ago.The Australian trout cod and pedder galaxias, both freshwater fish, have also showed improvement, the former moving from endangered to vulnerable and the latter from critically endangered to endangered, after many years of conservation efforts.However, the red list data released on Tuesday also showed 73 species declines despite conservation efforts, and the list now numbers 112,432 species around the world, of which more than 30,000 are on the brink of extinction.The IUCN update came as governments from more than 190 nations met in Madrid for two weeks of talks aimed at pushing global action on greenhouse gas emissions. Progress at the talks has been slow, despite public pressure, and campaigners have been frustrated that key issues such as the bioersity crisis have received little official attention.“The tightly woven links between climate and bioersity must be recognised at COP25 and there is good reason for this: the impact that a changing climate will have on the ability of ecosystems to support plant and animal life, and the challenges that bioersity already face in a warming world are both vast,” said Gareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.Ecosystems are already under unprecedented pressure from human impacts, including habitat loss from encroachment by urbanisation and farming, pollution, hunting, overfishing and invasive species. But the accelerating climate crisis is pushing nature to breaking point around the world, wiping out vital ecosystems, putting unbearable pressure on species and leading some experts to declare a fifth mass extinction.“To avert the worst of these impacts, we have to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C,” said Redmond-King. “There is no time for debate. Only a dramatic increase in the ambition of our collective response can avert the climate crisis we are in.”One of the ironies of the UN climate talks is that protecting natural systems could provide a lifeline for humanity out of the climate crisis – yet it is one that is often neglected at these annual talks. A focus on “nature-based solutions” could make a marked difference to action on the climate, said Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme. “We need to take the lessons we have learned on the climate change journey.”She pointed to deforestation, which threatens species and is accelerating the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Preserving forests is relatively cheap, but is the subject of tense debate at the COP25 talks because some nations want to sell carbon credits from their standing forests, as well as counting them towards their national emissions reduction targets. That argument has yet to be resolved, and may not be before the UN talks end on Friday.Marine bioersity – which is under threat from climate breakdown – was also supposed to be a key focus at these talks, which were billed as the Blue COP when the location was fixed as Santiago in Chile. The move to Madrid, forced by political unrest in Chile, has meant a loss of some of that focus, frustrating oceans campaigners, who have argued that protecting the oceans is vital to their capacity to store carbon and help combat the climate emergency.Oceana, a marine NGO, called attention to the “blue forests” composed of marine algae which are widespread across the planet and which store carbon dioxide and provide a lifeline for the thousands of species that depend on them “Blue forests are one of the main lungs of our oceans, and we should protect them as they deserve,” said Ricardo Aguilar, the senior research director at Oceana in Europe. “Scientific reports tend to focus on terrestrial forests, but marine algae can account for as much as a fifth of the CO2 stored by oceans. It is vital that decision-makers include their protection within international policies against the climate crisis.”Another study released at COP25, published in the journal Global Change Biology, illustrated how preserving mangrove groves can provide a key buffer against the impacts of global heating. Researchers studied the Segara Anakan lagoon in Java, Indonesia, and found it had huge potential for storing carbon, fostering bioersity and protecting against storms.Next year will be a crucial one for action on both the climate emergency and the bioersity crisis. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, where nations will have to come up with vastly improved targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decade to fulfil the pledges of the 2015 Paris agreement.Before those talks take place, in Glasgow next November, the IUCN will hold its four-yearly World Conservation Congress in June and the UN Bioersity Convention will decide on new measures for preserving species at a meeting in Kunming, China, in October.Campaigners hope the sequence of key meetings will lead to a greater focus on nature in the coming year, but stressed that more needed to be done to draw out the interdependency of these issues, rather than allowing them to be seen in isolation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1efab452d6dc908d91a86cace51f48a8e8bb727/0_109_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff11f3a7ba7c9204a2d0bd6682d1fdc1","title":"christmas side dishes a pan fried sprouts with soy and hazelnuts recipe","story":"Even the sprout-shy will warm to these flash-fried, soy-covered flavour bombs that go so well with a Christmas turkeyYotam Ottolenghi’s Christmas side dish: harissa and gruyere gratinThis is such a delicious way to cook sprouts, and they go beautifully with turkey.

Boil the broccoli and sprouts in salted water, but steam the sweet potato. Panko are especially light Japanese breadcrumbs available from anywhere with a decent stock of Japanese ingredients. If you can’t find them, you can use coarse white breadcrumbs dried in the oven.

We’ve tested this with different tins without much success, so do make sure you use a 27cm bundt tin that does not have a removable base. I’d recommend making this a day ahead, because it tastes even better when fridge-cold. 160g caramel sauce (thick set), store bought or homemade – I used Waitrose salted caramel dipping sauce1 tbsp whole milkFor the chocolate cake120g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing250g plain flour½ tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda70g cocoa powder¼ tsp salt100g dark muscovado sugar125g caster sugar2 large eggs200ml buttermilkFor the flan1 x 400g tin evaporated milk 1 x 397g tin sweetened condensed milk 120g full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature3 large eggs2 tsp vanilla bean paste¼ tsp saltHeat the oven to 170C (160C fan) 350Fgas 4. Liberally grease a 27cm bundt tin with butter, then coat the bottom with half the caramel sauce and put the tin into a larger roasting tin about 40cm x 28cm in size.Now start on the cake batter. Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarb, cocoa powder and salt into a medium bowl. Put the butter and both sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on medium speed for about two minutes, until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time only until just incorporated, then turn the speed to medium-low. Mix in a third of the flour mixture and half the buttermilk, then repeat before adding the last of the flour. Mix until everything is just incorporated, then transfer to the bundt tin, smoothing out the top with the back of a spoon.For the flan batter, blitz all the ingredients in a blender until smooth – about 15 seconds. Pour the flan batter over the cake batter in the tin, then cover the bundt tin first with a piece of greaseproof paper and then with a piece of foil, wrapping it up tightly. Add enough boiling water to the roasting tin to come about 2cm up the sides of the bundt tin, then transfer to the oven and bake for an hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out almost clean rotate the tin once after 30 minutes, to ensure an even bake. Lift the tin out of its water bath, remove the foil and greaseproof paper, and leave for about an hour, until completely cool.Invert the chocoflan on to a large, round platter – you may need to shake it slightly to release it from the tin – then refrigerate until cold, for at least two hours and, ideally, if time allows, overnight. To serve, thin the remaining 80g caramel with the milk and drizzle all over the flan.• This article was edited on 10 December 2019.

He tells them they’re showing too much respect for their opponent, in this case the reigning champions of Europe. They must be more physical, he insists, even if it means picking up a foul. His words are delivered in German with a dash of English.Und get fucking stuck in!Eventually, the scene becomes less typical. Nearly a minute into the half-time harangue, the manager, Red Bull Salzburg’s Jesse Marsch, shifts to his native tongue, and the uniqueness of the situation – or perhaps the American-ness – comes into focus.“They have to feel us, guys,” Marsch said to the players, who had fallen behind 3-0 in the first 40 minutes before getting a goal back. “They have to know we’re here to fucking compete.” His team got the message. Salzburg stormed back against Liverpool to erase the two-goal deficit in the first 15 minutes of the second half before conceding a 69th-minute goal to Mohamed Salah and ultimately losing 4-3. But it is safe to say that the defending champions felt Marsch’s squad. “There are teams that would maybe break down after 3-0 at Anfield,” said Jürgen Klopp, “but they weren’t, they were not really bothered.”Video of Marsch’s fiery speech, recorded for a documentary series, quickly went viral. For much of the European footballing community, it served as an introduction to the 46-year-old who became the first American to coach in the Champions League this season. His stature could grow even larger on Tuesday, when Salzburg host Liverpool in a rematch teeming with implications.A defeat at Red Bull Arena could see the holders go out of the competition at the group stage while Salzburg would qualify for the Champions League knockout stage for the first time, and further burnish the credentials of a promising young squad and its up-and-coming manager.For Marsch, it could bring the added benefit of getting people to stop focusing so much on that October speech at Anfield. “Yeah, a little bit,” Marsch tells the  when asked if he’s tired of talking about the footage.Marsch has defended his club for permitting the dressing room recording, but he admitted there were a few moments that made him sheepish. “Here in Austria and in Europe, they don’t take the f-word as seriously as in the States,” Marsch says with a laugh. “But it’s not great to have a video out with so many f-words.“The other problem I had was that it made it seem like the coach did everything,” he adds. “We’re always a group here. What made the performance so great is that the players went out and played so bravely. People are asking me, ‘What’s it like going against Klopp?’ It’s not me against Klopp. It’s our team against Liverpool.”Getting Salzburg to the knockout stages would represent the apex of Marsch’s coaching career, a trajectory that has seen him go from Major League Soccer to the American college ranks and back to MLS before eventually landing last year in Europe as an assistant at Red Bull Leipzig, where he served under Ralf Rangnick. And in the midst of that footballing odyssey, he embarked on a personal one.His first head coaching job came in 2012, when he was tapped to lead the Montreal Impact during the club’s inaugural campaign in MLS, but the fit was not quite right and Marsch stepped down after one season in which the team failed to qualify for the league playoffs. “I think in Montreal there were moments when I felt the pressure too much, and I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders,” Marsch says.He considered taking other jobs before he and his wife, Kim, decided to set off on a globe-trotting adventure with their three young children. They went rafting in the Himalayas and swam in the Ganges they saw the Pyramids and Taj Mahal, staying in hostels and crashing on friends’ couches along the way. “We didn’t want to go from Marriott to Marriott,” Marsch says. “We found what made countries so fascinating was the people.”With a fresh perspective, Marsch returned to his alma mater in 2013 to become a volunteer assistant for the Princeton soccer team. Two years later he was hired as head coach of New York Red Bulls. Marsch won coach of the year honours in his first season in New York, guiding the club to a Supporters’ Shield before falling to Columbus in the Eastern Conference finals of the MLS Cup.New York qualified for the playoffs in the next two seasons under Marsch, each time bowing out in the second round. Last year, Marsch decided it was time to decamp from North America once again. Midway through the season, with New York in the thick of another title chase, he left the club – where he had the best win-ratio of any coach in their history – for a job as an assistant under Rangnick at RB Leipzig.“Pedigree still matters a lot to people in Europe,” Marsch says. “A year in the Bundesliga as an assistant and working under Ralf Rangnick gave me a little bit more to put in my back pocket to go into the next job. It has helped me be better at my job, but it’s also helped the perception of me here.”Marsch’s sensitivity to perception brings his American background into focus just as acutely as that half-time speech at Anfield. It also invites comparisons to Bradley, who in 2016 became the first American to manage in the Premier League when he took over at Swansea City. But Bradley’s time on the job was ill-fated: he lasted only 85 days, an abbreviated tenure best remembered for the ridicule he endured over his use of American vernacular.Marsch says Bradley’s difficult time at Swansea was a factor in the decision to take the assistant job at Leipzig. “When I started thinking about the possibility of leaving for Europe, I saw Bob Bradley and what he went through and I tried to best acclimate myself to European football.”For Marsch, that meant learning the language and steeping himself in the culture, an exercise that harkens back to his family’s global expedition. That preparation all culminated last spring, when he took over at Salzburg, where he says he is “not treated like an American coach”.“My goal was to assimilate, to be myself, but to also honour the culture that I’m working in. Three years ago, I spoke zero German. Zero. Now I’m relatively fluent. It’s been three years working my butt off to learn the language. I care about it. In some ways, I’m obsessed about it,” he says. “Most of these clubs are a century old. In America, MLS is 25 years old. We’re in our infancy. That’s the way Europeans feel about American football. It’s not true. It’s not reflective of our actual expertise. But we don’t have nearly enough history.”That Marsch has been able to combat the stigma has made him something of a folk hero to fans of the game in the United States. “I think American players and coaches are always fighting for respect,” Bradley has said. “Jesse’s success means a lot to everybody here.”Marsch, who has said he would like to coach the US men’s national team at some point, is quick to downplay the broader significance of his status as an American coaching in the top club competition in the world. He says his focus is squarely on the club he has been tasked to lead, a young squad brimming with talented players such as the 19-year-old Norwegian striker Erling Braut Haaland.A win over Liverpool would have Salzburg fans dreaming of a deep Champions League run, while Americans would revel in the historic breakthrough of one of their own. Whatever the result, Marsch is confident that his players will be felt on the pitch. “Tuesday is a big night for us,” he said. “We know we have a good group. We’re not perfect. We still have a lot to learn. But the team doesn’t fear anyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/880299622d36817aa29046fb3cf1a07e09eaadcb/0_0_5295_3177/master/5295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9377051716070c968d8d8b9dae7ba8ee","title":"west ham manuel pellegrini stays southampton defeat could bring sack manager","story":"Manuel Pellegrini will take charge of West Ham’s Premier League game at Southampton on Saturday but defeat could prompt his dismissal as manager.Pellegrini told West Ham’s board in the wake of the defeat against Arsenal on Monday that he is convinced he can turn around the team’s fortunes and his employers have kept faith with him for now.But their belief in his ability to haul the club away from relegation danger is waning and losing on Saturday against one of the four teams below them could be the point of no return.David Moyes, Chris Hughton and Eddie Howe are among candidates who will be considered if Pellegrini is sacked. West Ham are known to admire Rafael Benítez but a move for the former Liverpool manager is unlikely to succeed given the cost involved in taking him from Dalian Yifang and Benítez’s insistence this week that “there is no chance I will come back now”.West Ham have won only one of their past 11 matches.

So is it time to kick away our chairs and go back to nature?I drop into an outdoor freezer full of water and ice, with no clothes on, in December. My body starts to buck, breath unable to leave my lungs. It feels as if I’m going into cardiac arrest.I suspect that this one-to-one session with Tony Riddle, ultra-athlete and natural lifestyle coach, will be my ruin. When he greets me, too early in the morning, he is disconcertingly hale, with the focused gaze of a Viking approaching shore. Worse, he is wearing a pair of those amphibious foot-gloves. You know, the ones with inidual toe sheaths that make you think a gorilla is walking towards you on its hands.“Inside every human is an endurance athlete,” is one of his remarks on meeting, which is a) too inspiring for a Tuesday morning, and b) not true. Beneath my feckless exterior is an even lazier core slob, only kept at bay with strategic food bribes and inconvenient council tax demands.Riddle’s “rewilding” philosophy is about reconnecting humans to natural behaviours – particularly ways of moving that modern lifestyles have estranged us from. We were not designed to sit for 10 hours a day, he explains. Electric lighting confuses our sleep cycles. Urban architecture encourages bad posture. The artificial repetitions of the gym encourage strain and uneven musculature. He winces when he sees my trainers, which is rich. Why are most shoes narrower at the front than the heel? he asks. A foot’s natural shape is the opposite – toes are meant to spread, and grip the ground: we have more than 100 muscles down there. Thick-soled, cushioned running shoes cause these to atrophy, and deprive us of sensory feetback. I mean back feet. I mean feedback. Sorry, I’ve been sitting for a while.I thought the session might involve gently foraging for nuts actually, Riddle’s thesis is that naturally developed bodies have incredible abilities. There’s much focus on feet – “the basis of your superstructure”. I stand on one leg, flailing, confirming my body has less balance than my bank account. Yet I find revelations, too. We practice the Wim Hof breathing technique, and I’m astonished to learn I can hold my breath – after exhaling – for a full minute.Next, we move to straight-arm pullups, and I’m a little confused by these attempts to raise my body toward a metal bar, without bending at the elbow. Surely an anatomical impossibility, at best a physical riddle? Oh, my God, I think, arms shaking, his name is Toe Knee Riddle? Like a superhero alias. A few weeks ago, Riddle ran the length of the country barefoot, to raise money for charity, despite being born with underdeveloped lower limbs and spending years in braces. Needless to say, he pulls himself toward the bar using just his back muscles, until he is almost horizontal.There are also simpler ideas for living naturally in the modern world: squatting at your office desk “surfing” inside train carriages, which involves avoiding handrails and using micro-adjustments of your feet to balance removing chairs from your home.But the extreme ideas are fascinating. “Cold immersion is so under-rated,” Riddle announces. I, however, don’t think it’s under-rated enough. He believes ice baths have benefits for cellular response, digestion and the immune system. I believe it will make my organs shut down. The disagreement is academic – I check my bag, realise I’ve forgotten my swimming trunks. Riddle looks at me in a way that seems to say: “That was a subconscious choice, to avoid the ice bath.” He has a spare pair, he laughs, slapping me on the back.And this is how I found myself climbing into a freezer of water, worrying about having a heart attack. “Breathe,” Riddle compels me. Exhaling will calm my nervous system, he says. And it does. I stop shivering. I spend two minutes submerged in the ice, surprisingly calm. My body adapts, capable of more than I thought. When I step out, I feel superhuman.You know what? I do recommend this. Rewilding chimes with me. It’s not macho and it emphasises play. I would sooner climb a tree than up my reps in the gym. I like running the low walls in my neighbourhood, and prefer a dance around the kitchen to any fitness fad. A morning of getting back to nature has left me feeling vital and empowered. I wonder what six months of this could do. When I agreed to go rewilding, I thought we would be releasing wolves in Leeds city centre. I’d definitely pack my trunks for that. Wildness. I won’t wear the glove shoe, though. 55One-to-one Rewilding sessions with Tony Riddle start from £120, and there are workshops available from 14 December for £60.

It became an important part of the relationship – even when things were going well.”After their wedding this summer, the couple continued to attend sessions while they settled into marriage. By discussing potential problems with an unbiased third party, Thomas says they both felt confident to be more open with each other.It also helped them to work on their communication styles, which has further strengthened their relationship. “It’s not just what you say, but when and how you say it. Before therapy, I might say something critical first thing in the morning and Jenny would immediately become defensive. We’ve learned that we communicate better when we allocate a time to sit down after dinner and rationally discuss things.”Although the couple dated for eight years before they got married, Thomas believes that counselling prepared them for the changes that come with marriage. “Even after all that time, therapy opened my eyes to new things about Jenny. It helped me to understand that people deal with issues in different ways and I have become better at seeing things from her perspective.”While premarital or wedding therapy may sound unromantic to some, for many couples, it is a way to future-proof a relationship and smash the dangerous illusion of the fairytale ending. “We had a fantastic connection when we met, but over time you have to put effort into a relationship,” says Thomas.It might seem out of the ordinary, but Cate Campbell, a sex and relationship therapist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, says such therapy is on the rise. “In the past five years, this type of counselling has become increasingly popular,” she says. “I think people are becoming increasingly realistic about relationships.”However loved-up couples seem on their wedding day, the Office for National Statistics shows that the average marriage in the UK lasts 12 years. It is a far cry from the “happy ever after” ending promised by books and movies, which could explain why more couples are taking a proactive approach to maintaining healthy relationships.Unlike traditional couples therapy, which is often attended after a serious relationship breakdown, premarital therapy aims to prevent problems before they arise. It can cover a wide range of topics tailored to the couple, including money management, parenting, holidays, sex and other issues.“Sometimes I see couples who consider themselves soulmates. When they realise they have differences, this can be very hard to digest and they run into problems,” says Campbell. During the honeymoon phase, any small disagreements are often obscured by oxytocin, the love hormone that helps us to bond and reproduce. “Once we commit to each other or have a baby, this starts to wear off. That’s where small problems can start to escalate.”For many religious communities, premarital counselling isn’t a new phenomenon. When Georgina Fuller got married 11 years ago, she was expected to take a six-week marriage preparation course, run by priests. “It was mandatory so that we could marry in the Catholic church,” she says.“We went once a week for a couple of hours and got advice about our relationship. It included topics such as shared values, and managing expectations about marriage. They advised couples to discuss how they would want to bring up children together. It’s a very important thing to talk about and it’s not always the first thing people think of when they’re in love and planning a wedding.”Although elements of the course were useful, Fuller says the heavy focus on religion was alienating. “I felt the course was more about telling us what to do so that we could be good Catholics, as opposed to listening to us and helping us to understand our feelings. I think traditional therapy, where couples discuss their feelings openly with their partner, is more helpful.”As the complexities of modern life increase and people live more secular lives, many people are turning to independent, non-religious counselling for support. Last year, the School of Life in London introduced premarital psychotherapy to help couples build on the existing foundations of their relationship.“Our pre-marriage or pre-commitment therapy isn’t just for people getting married,” says Charlotte Fox Weber, the head of psychotherapy for the school. “It could be for couples who are having a baby or buying a house together. We support people to understand the realities of taking their relationship to the next level.”Known as “romantic realism”, more than 70 couples have signed up for premarital therapy since the sessions were launched. “We have seen a big rise in the number of young couples attending therapy, but we’re also seeing older couples who have been orced, recognised they made mistakes and want to make things work this time around.”Fox Weber says that some couples are even given therapy sessions as a wedding gift. “Sometimes people think they’re so in love that they don’t need therapy. But counselling can make a good life even better. It’s like taking out breakdown cover before your car breaks down.”It is something that Angela wishes she had considered when she got married in 2010, after a three-year engagement. “I never imagined anything could go wrong. We were so in love on our honeymoon, it made me wonder how relationships ever break down.” But almost a decade on, she is able to see how easily cracks can form. “We’ve faced a lot of stress over the years which has been hard to cope with,” she says.At the end of 2012, her partner lost his job shortly after the birth of their first child. The couple moved from their home in Australia to New Zealand to find work, which left Angela homesick and without the support of her extended family. By the time her second child was born two years later, she was struggling to keep her head above water.“Premarital therapy prepares you for what’s to come and there was a lot I wasn’t expecting,” she says. “I had no idea how difficult it would be to have two small children, or how much I would struggle with losing my financial independence on maternity leave. It became harder to discuss these issues with my partner because I was so exhausted I couldn’t even articulate how I was feeling.”Although she recognises, in hindsight, that these emotions are normal, it made her feel there was something wrong. “Communication starts to break down so quickly when you’re tired and stressed. Every tiny thing can build into resentment. Therapy helps you to see the potential pitfalls to prevent these clashes from happening.”The couple are extremely happy now, but it has taken time to iron out their differences. “One of the most important things for me is realising that when you are in a relationship, you are still an independent person responsible for your own happiness,” says Angela.In 2017, she made the decision to retrain as a mindset and success coach, which she believes has given her the tools she needs to take control of her own life. “Once I had this, it was easy to see how to get my marriage to a great place again.”Her sentiments are echoed by Campbell, who says that part of being in a healthy relationship is having confidence in yourself. “You need to feel happy that you can disagree with your partner and the world won’t end,” she says. “In reality, soulmates and perfect relationships do not exist. But premarital therapy can help two iniduals build strong foundations for the future.”(Some names have been changed)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

It is not.After videos of the Juice musician’s outfit went viral last night, people paid their respects on Twitter: it seems multiple children had their innocence stolen at the game. Lizzo, dancing happily on the Jumbotron mm-hming at Karl Towns, apparently did not realize she was at a family game.While the language of the outrage focuses on moral decency, the Rikishi jokes, the photos circulating comparing Lizzo to Jabba the Hutt, the countless memes of grimacing children and the “just why” commentary all seem to be another question: does she not realize how fat she is?Lizzo does realize she just doesn’t see being fat as an insult. “When I’m looking at my body and I’m shaming every little thing about it… I have to find love in those things. And I think that is why I’m able to call myself fat,” she said in an interview with CBS this year.Some argue that this is nothing to do with Lizzo’s size: an ill-advised outfit is ill-advised on anyone, fat or not. Those people would be well advised to consider that when Nicki Minaj wore a bondage outfit to a Lakers game in 2018, people barely bat an eyelid. Nor was the same disdain afforded to Rhianna after she attended a Raptors game in a see-through shirt and no bra. If RiRi pushes fashion to its limits, after all, it’s a statement to be celebrated. But when Lizzo dares to push the envelope, the discourse takes a whole different slant infused with fat-shaming.And when the cheerleaders do it?

Berlin has a new generation of queer club nights – among them Herrensauna, Lecken and Buttons – but Cocktail d’Amore was the initiator of this wave.Cocktail’s organisers are Discodromo, AKA Giacomo Garavelloni and Giovanni Turco, an Italian duo who relocated to Berlin in 2008 after years of visiting the city to go clubbing in Berghain (“it completely blew our minds”). Dissatisfied by the city’s musical limitations, they founded Cocktail with Berlin club scene veteran and Berghain resident Boris.“Our taste was Italo, disco, house, and in general music that would create some emotional reaction,” Discodromo say via email, wanting to be quoted as a pair. “No other queer clubs or parties were offering this music.”Since its beginnings in a Kreuzberg basement, Cocktail has inhabited spaces all over Berlin, from warehouses and a circus tent to an abandoned GDR supermarket. One punter, Sarah Hamilton, attended Cocktail at Shake in 2013, and says: “the vibe, as it was early in the night, was sex, sex, sex among the mostly male partiers.” A queer, sex-positive attitude is Cocktail’s lifeblood. “I will always remember the first time I played at Cocktail,” says Trent, a Berlin scene DJ. “All night long in the cosmic hole, surrounded by people having sex in the darkness – I thought it was really insane.”This vibe is distilled in its flyers, posters and promo videos, designed by Pindaros Andriopoulos, who moved to Berlin from Greece around the same time as Garavelloni and Turco, and also does artwork for the Cocktail d’Amore record label. Equal parts psychedelic, philosophical and pornographic, Pindar’s aesthetic was in place from Cocktail’s first flyer – a bouquet of roses made of penises.Currently, Cocktail takes place monthly at Griessmuehle, a club in a converted former factory, where they moved after losing a location “due to corporate estate investments”. During Cocktail, Griessmuehle’s basement dancefloor becomes a sex dungeon (the aforementioned “cosmic hole”) its inner chambers, a labyrinth of darkrooms its garden, a hybrid of playground, catwalk and disco. While the party has grown larger and moved away from its early underground settings, Griessmuehle’s expansive layout is optimally suited for shenanigans. Bordered by railway lines, industrial units and a canal, Griessmuehle allows you to forget normal life in a temporary autonomous zone.I stumble out into the cool evening air, sweat-soaked. Through the trees, Alex from Tokyo is blasting energetic disco. By a camp fire, a man describes dancing with the actor from Boy Erased (“He has a girlfriend, but it was him!”). A woman in a nun’s habit darts past. Two men, one in a pink beret and blue dungarees, the other in a red velvet suit, encourage a Scottish woman to stay, even though she has work tomorrow. Legs disappear into tree huts feet prance on the wooden decking.In Berlin, clubs don’t have a closing time (this enlightened attitude means the city’s nightlife industry is worth €1.5bn annually). Cocktail accordingly combines club night and after party. This weekend’s party kicked off on Saturday night, and the last pair of feet won’t finish dancing till 4pm on Monday – an impressive  by any standards.Part of Cocktail’s pleasure is the warm encounters you have with random strangers, a fleeting closeness that society usually denies. Marcus Knupp describes DJ sets that “inspire, if only for a brief time, a feeling that there really is something to life other than the crushing 9-to-5 world we normally navigate”. He continues: “Spaces like Cocktail are the kind of fertile soils needed for all kinds of creative, progressive and positive ideas to even begin to come into being.”Nonetheless, change may be coming. There are rumours that Griessmuehle, which runs on a six-monthly lease, may be forced to shut its doors. What would become of Cocktail if Griessmuehle closes? Garavelloni and Turco are unworried. “In the first five years we had around 15 locations,” they say. “If Griessmuehle ever closed we would move on and find or create an alternative, as we did in the past.”Boris finishes his set with a rousing Boys Will Be Boys by the Duncan Sisters. Behind the decks, Boris and Discodromo share a hug and a celebratory glass of sekt. Discodromo then launch into some unclassifiable hypnotic beats. A queen’s high heel treads on my toe and the dancefloor begins heaving. I think about going home. Then I remember a quote used in one of Cocktail’s music videos: “Life is short and there will always be dirty dishes, so let’s dance.”“Currently a Cocktail hit. Somehow impossible to put it in a defined genre, it has an unusual arrangement of elements, surprising juxtapositions, and overall we find it an interesting exploration of new sonic territories.”“This track from one of our favourite producers, Maurice Fulton, is an example of what can be heard in the Cosmic Hole, the dancefloor (which also serves as a darkroom) that is dedicated to slow and trippy sounds. The Hole, as Cocktail people refer to it, is a project we started five years ago, inspired by famous 80s Italian clubs Cosmic and Typhoon. In fact, we had Beppe Loda play in there not long ago, which was a total dream come true.”“In one party you might listen to music from five decades and almost every danceable genre … and everything in between. Such as this relatively obscure mix by François K of mega pop band Wham.”“The project from our longtime Detroit friend Jeffrey Sfire (we met in Panorama Bar in 2006) and Scottish vanguard-pop producer Sophie was recorded while they were both living in Berlin. It came out with Sfire3 on Cocktail d’Amore Music in 2013 and became an underground cult release for many. A Cocktail towards-the-end-of-the-party singalong kinda tune.”Lord of the Isles – Ultraviolet“Last track of so many Cocktails, released in 2012. It’s just perfect: it has a super groovy uplifting pace with a piano-chords progression that gives peaceful and positive melancholic feelings, great to send people off in the right mood. The delicate balance of harmonies could make the song go on infinitely. After we heard it for the first time, we had to get in touch with LotI and release his music on our label.”• A compilation, Nothing Matters When We’re Dancing Vol 10, and a book, 10, are both out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa22653aa4c2813613611c50d0e63c188a8f552/0_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cfa7762f75beec1a808b0a574bb253","title":"election 2019 inside momentum podcast","story":"Anushka Asthana reports from inside Momentum, the grassroots movement hoping to propel Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street.

But it’s not going to happen! I can’t see it happening.”He said it was “dire for Labour” as a result of a “combination of Corbyn and Brexit” outside of city seats, and told the friend that he “can’t see it happening” that Corbyn would be prime minister.Appearing to refer to an unsuccessful plot to oust Corbyn, Ashworth says: “We fucked it up in 2016 when we went too early. People like me were internally saying: ‘This isn’t the right moment,’ but I got kind of ignored. But I don’t think we’re going to get there In Mansfield, in Ashfield, it’s dire for the Labour party up there, these traditional working areas.”Pressed then on what would happen to Corbyn if the Tories won the election outright, Ashworth said: “That’s the thing that’s on our minds … I think things can change quickly I think things change more quickly anyway now.”Ashworth told Derbyshire they were “having banter with each other – we’re joking around”.“No, I don’t mean it because I’m joking around with my mate because he’s a Tory … If you leak it to Guido Fawkes of course it makes me look like a right plonker but it’s not what I mean when I’m winding up a friend – I’m trying to sort of pull his leg a bit,” he said.He later apologised to Labour party members telling BBC 2’s Politics Live programme: “Obviously with the benefit of hindsight I’ve been too clever by half and I look like an idiot as a result of doing it.But I thought I was having a private conversation with someone who I’ve always had conversations with over the years.“It’s obviously stupid. I apologise to Labour party members but the reason it has come out today is because the Tories don’t want to be talking about the fact that we’ve had a toddler lying on the floor in a hospital.”The Conservatives seized on the recording after suffering a terrible day of gaffes on Monday, over Johnson’s refusal to look at a picture of a sick boy on a hospital floor and peddling untrue claims that a Tory aide had been hit by a Labour activist.A Conservative spokesman said: “This is an honest and truly devastating assessment of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership by one of his most trusted election lieutenants.“If even Corbyn’s closest political allies think he is unfit to be prime minister, why on earth should voters be expected to put their trust in him and them?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae246b803994e332640efe7fe519e926d20ab895/0_30_545_327/master/545.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=037b5f9eebc4b86bf067e75a96da6829","title":"the guardian election social media caption quiz","story":"Can you identify the correct captions in this selection of selfies, photos and video clips posted by campaigning politicians?Whether it’s a mean and moody portrait like Matt Hancock’s, or Richard Burgon hanging out with a friendly dog, or even Jo Swinson squeezing a cushion, increasingly social-media-savvy politicians always keep an eye out for a Twitter quip that can cut through.Here’s a selection of light-hearted selfies, photos and video clips posted by campaigning politicians in the past few days – can you match the correct caption to the Twitter pic?Let us know how you get on in the comments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4704845d04c69edec082ed093af1da7c6d156b8c/57_0_647_388/master/647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f132914b09aa1c17f4d71940404204a","title":"election polls uk 2019 latest opinion poll tracker tories labour","story":"Find out who’s ahead using our opinion poll tracker.

During a visit coordinated by the National Organisation of Social Workers (NOSW), I saw the powerful contribution of social work to restoring a nation torn apart by genocide, working towards a reconciliatory and vibrant future.The social work profession in Rwanda was formed following the 1994 genocide, which had its roots in the colonialist ide-and-rule administration and systematic oppression of the Tutsi population. After the slaughter of more than 800,000 people, Rwanda’s social fabric was in tatters. Economic institutions collapsed, there was widespread displacement and many women were pregnant as the result of rape.However, Consolee Uwihangana of the NOSW stresses: “The story of Rwanda is one of overcoming the history sown by the colonists. Ours is a story of reconciliation, repair and self-reliance, and as a nation we have made immense strides.”Social work has been a key factor in making this progress, through homegrown solutions or indigenous models of development that address the many layers of social wounds. Uwihangana explains the role of social workers: “We are counsellors, community facilitators, advocates and policy influencers. We work both with iniduals and whole communities as the nation needs to work together to overcome the challenges.”Among other approaches, social workers have been deeply involved with programmes such as umuganda (community work), ubudehe (local collective action) and girinka (one cow per poor family).With girinka, social workers are using an indigenous tradition as a vehicle for community change. A cow is issued to every poor family and, according to Charles Kalinganire of NOSW: “Giving the firstborn calf to your neighbour has been an enormous part of the reconciliation process, as neighbours and villagers to this day swap cows, reinforcing their connections and bonds.”Another inspiring example of social change from Rwanda’s capital city, Kigali, is Hope and Homes for Children, a community hub that prevents children from being abandoned. Emery Nduwimana, a social worker with the charity, explains that some of the factors that contribute to child abandonment include parental trauma resulting from rape, family isolation, drug abuse, vulnerability and stigma towards children with disabilities.As we drive into the mid-city community along the red earth road, Nduwimana points out the range of activity at the centre. In one classroom the walls are vibrating from loud drumming as young men practise traditional dance. “Our traditional culture is a safe and vibrant setting for them,” Nduwimana says before leading me to a classroom where adults are learning English as skills for employment.Outside, a group of women in patterned dresses and brightly coloured head scarves are holding a weekly meeting to administer their community finances. The programme offers loans to community members, supporting their entrepreneurial plans and providing relief when times are hard.There is still more work to be done to promote reconciliation in Rwanda – but as the fragrances of eucalyptus and pine drift through the air, I am hopeful. It’s clear from the absence of street children and beggars, and the inclusive gatherings of men and women planning their collective futures, that innovative social work has made an impact.Rwandans are right to be proud: in a short timeframe, the nation has achieved unparalleled progress in reconciliation and development. Social work has played a vital role in this success.• Rory Truell is secretary-general of the International Federation of Social Workers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19881050d55e63b93fa6d29a8a8e6334faad9b67/0_18_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c668145cae27742d8c7555a0dbdd8ec","title":"five ways to get your family into classical music","story":"Classical music offers something for everyone, says Kate Faithfull-Williams, from toddlers to teens to the kid rolling their eyes as they read this over your shoulder …Classical music can be daunting. With a genre dating back hundreds of years, the choices are overwhelming. So where do you start? With the benefits, that’s where.“Music brings people together and helps kids – and parents – listen better,” says composer John Webb, who has worked with everyone from five-year-old songwriters to traditional Indian musicians and a virtual symphony orchestra to introduce new audiences to classical music. Classical tracks are also scientifically proven to relieve stress, boost brainpower and even help us be more open emotionally – all good news for happy families. So, here’s how to get involved ...Toddlers and preschoolers“Young kids are innately musical,” says Webb, mimicking the singsong speech and extended vowel sounds we instinctively use with small people – “Ooh what a bee-yoo-tiful baby”. Children have an unrepressed desire to dance, too. “Kids move in different ways to different music, tiptoeing, stamping and twirling,” explains Webb.So how can you bring out the best in your mini maestro? Composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty topped the iTunes Classical Charts, says: “Try listening to Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns, which describes lots of wild animals through music.”From age five to eightDid you know that this is the prime age for children to write music? “Kids naturally make up their own songs as they play,” says Webb, who generously describes those improvised 10-second tunes as, “mashups”. To enhance that natural ability, he advises using a story as a hook. “Kids love stories, and quickly understand that different notes and speeds of music create a sense of character. Classical music is easily simplified and it can be creative and powerful for children.”Want to get involved? Try something like the BBC Singers Family Concert (9 February 2020, Milton Court Concert Hall, Barbican, London prices from £5), which promises to be very interactive and is aimed at kids aged five and over. Alternatively, join the BBC Concert Orchestra at Musical Roots (22 February 2020, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, London prices from £5) for a magical adventure the whole family can enjoy, exploring exciting and unusual connections between composers, their music and their families.From age nine to 12You may know that playing an instrument can improve a child’s memory and coordination, and teach them perseverance. You definitely know that persuading your pre-teen to practise playing an instrument is like lighting a stick of dynamite, so explosive are the arguments.The solution, suggests Davis, could be as simple as inspiring your child by letting them see someone older play their instrument expertly. The BBC is laying on two upcoming events that will transport young people into a different world and get them excited about playing.Try Family Total Immersion: Lift Off! (1 December, Barbican Hall, London prices from £5) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, which celebrates 50 years since the moon landing with live music, interactive workshops and film to take you on a musical adventure through space. Best of all, there are more than two hours of drop-in foyer activities, including the chance for kids to try a variety of instruments before the show.David Walliams is also doing a special performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (2 May 2020, Barbican, London prices from £5), which is virtually guaranteed to hook kids into playing classical music. Walliams will read from his bestselling children’s books, including Bad Dad and The World’s Worst Children, alongside musical treats from a full orchestra.The teenage yearsCan parents introduce anything to their sceptical teen? “The kiss of death is for a parent to show keenness,” warns Webb. “Osmosis is your best bet, so play the pieces you like at home. Go for tracks with a pounding rhythm and bleakness, like Shostakovich Symphony No 5, as the raw energy and emotion may get your teen’s attention.”Film can also be a good entry point for teenagers. “I would always point towards innovative composers and performers who are very current,” says Davis. “So maybe don’t start with Mozart. Instead, go for composers like Max Richter, who scored Mary Queen of Scots, or Joby Talbot, who scored The League of Gentlemen. Both Richter and Talbot are also serious concert hall composers in their own right.” Talbot’s Everest will be performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra next year (20 June 2020, Barbican Hall, London prices from £10).If all else fails …Stealth is a weapon at your disposal. “There are so many great concerts out there, but the mistake is dragging a reluctant child to a classical concert and expecting them to walk out enlightened and interested,” warns Davis. “So find an appropriate concert of music your child might grow to like and research the music that’s going to be performed. Play sections of it in the car and at home ahead of the concert. Otherwise it’s a huge amount to take in. As the composer Philip Glass once said: ‘People don’t know what they love, they love what they know.’”Learn more about getting the whole family into classical music with advice and events from the BBC’s Get Involved initiative"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74a5d2acb2873abc14bed956a93236f61b4fd467/0_1242_2678_1607/master/2678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2f5d5dfe6bccef4b42f69d3c0008aaa","title":"buy a classic sport photograph the big splash","story":"The tenth of a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free deliveryWhile most other photographers took their places on the sidelines of the athletics track at the White City stadium for the 1965 British Games, photographer Gerry Cranham, always hunting something a little different, ducked down alongside one of the steeplechase hurdles and awaited his quarry.

Her first reaction was “shock”.“We were hoping for the best, but we expected the worst,” Romashina said in an interview, calling the decision a “blow to the reputation of clean athletes”.After a five-minute break to digest the news, she said, “we got back to work”.The ban is the latest consequence of a pervasive doping programme in Russian sport and ensuing attempts to hide it from the World Anti-Doping Agency. The revelations have cast a long shadow over Russia’s Olympic programme and elicited some of the harshest sanctions in the history of international sport.Many Russian athletes say they have felt caught in the middle, calling the ban on the Russian team too harsh while also reserving strong words for a lack of effort from Russia’s sporting establishment.“I’m not a sporting official but, from where I stand, obviously they could have done more and done it better,” Romashina said.As Tokyo 2020 approaches, Romashina is one of hundreds of Russian athletes who can, at best, only realise their Olympic dream under a neutral banner rather than the flag of her country. But that decision will also require deep introspection, she said, pitting national feeling against camaraderie with her teammates.“On the one hand as an Olympic champion for Russia, I could say I won’t go, that I’ll be a patriot to the end and not compete under a neutral flag,” she said. “But I don’t compete alone. I compete as a pair, as part of a team, and I don’t have the right to let down my teammates. It’s not right to them. And why should I refuse to compete under a neutral flag, when I and my teammates have done nothing wrong?”Russia has won gold in every Olympic synchronised swimming competition since 2000, and was considered a favourite to continue that run at Tokyo 2020. Romashina, who competes in both the duet and team routines, has stormed back into competition this year after taking a three-year hiatus from swimming to have a child, winning gold medals at the world championships in Gwangju, South Korea, in July.“If we don’t go at all, and that is possible, then I will be far more hurt for the young athletes who would have been competing for the first time,” said Romashina. “I’ve been at the Olympic Games.

People are angry not only with pensions but low salaries, worsening prospects, the state of public services and what one demonstrator called “the feeling of being forgotten”.A grassroots citizens’ protest movement began in early November 2018 against a planned rise in the tax on diesel and petrol, which\u0026nbspEmmanuel Macron\u0026nbspinsisted would aid the country’s transition to green energy. A poll at the time found that the price of fuel had become France’s biggest talking point.The movement was named “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) because protesters wear the fluorescent yellow high-vis jackets that all motorists must by law carry in their cars. But what began as a fuel tax protest morphed into a wider anti-government movement.Unlike previous French protest movements, it sprang up online through petitions and was organised by ordinary working people posting videos on social media, without a set leader, trade union or political party behind it.One local MP for Emmanuel Macron’s party said it would be hard to tackle a protest movement that spread from pensions to several different grievances at once.Across the country, transport turmoil continued on Tuesday with trains at a virtual halt, some flights grounded, 10 lines of the Paris metro closed and more than 180 miles (300km) of traffic jams on roads around Paris by 7am local time (0600 GMT). Teachers, hospital staff, fire officers, air-traffic controllers and other public sector workers were expected to walk out alongside train drivers and transport workers.In the greater Paris area, where more than 9 million people depend on an already overburdened public transport system each day, there were dangerous crushes on packed platforms as crowds of commuters tried to push on to the very few banlieue trains running at rush hour.Macron, the pro-business president who has promised to deliver the biggest “transformation” of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era, regards his pension changes as a key test.He has staked his political credibility on refusing to buckle in the face of street protests, accusing previous presidents of lacking the resolve to stand strong. With Macron potentially aiming to run for a second term in office in 2022, backing down would be to risk losing his support base. But protesters said they feared France’s social safety net was being unpicked.The government argues that unifying the French pensions system – and getting rid of the 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff – is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. But unions say the changes are an attack on fundamental worker rights, and fear people will have to work longer for smaller pensions.Police ordered all shops to close on the route of the demonstration in southern Paris. Other big marches were planned in cities including Grenoble, Lyon and Rouen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854df0bc5a8d44844f423166b52d692614fae648/0_79_3072_1842/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f216eb8b2f5400caac93e66f2f25bf87","title":"paraguay dictator alfredo stroessner dictatorship","story":"The pro-Stroessner celebrations have all but disappeared but Paraguay is yet to fully confront the legacy of military ruleFor decades, it was known as the fecha feliz – the happy date – a cheerful-sounding name for the annual commemoration of South America’s longest-ruling military dictator.Paraguay’s General Alfredo Stroessner used the nationwide birthday party as an element of his carefully cultivated cult of personality. And the celebration has shown enormous staying power, surviving both the coup that toppled Stroessner in 1989 and his death in exile in Brazil in 2006.But this November 3, the General Stroessner polka – the celebration’s traditional adulatory soundtrack – was barely heard in the capital city. Instead, Asunción rang with music from anti-Stroessner parties.As José Caballero, who organized one such event, put it: “We’re dancing on Stroessner’s grave we’re fighting back with joy.”In recent years, the best-known pro-Stroessner celebrations have practically disappeared as a generation of supporters from the dictatorship years gradually dies off.But Paraguay has yet to fully confront the crimes and the legacy of military rule.And as recent events in South America have shown, authoritarian pasts can weigh heavily on countries decades after democratic transition, despite outward signs of change. Chile is now well into its second month of turmoil, fueled in part by anger over the neoliberal policies introduced by Augusto Pinochet.Fernando Robles, a Paraguayan lawyer, argues that his country has still not shaken off the dead hand of dictatorship.He spent three years in prison for belonging to a clandestine anti-Stroessner movement – “We were all tortured. Horrifically tortured, as was the custom of Stroessner and his police force” – but Robles worries that many in his country do not understand the lessons of the past.“Today, a 15-year-old or an 18-year-old doesn’t even know that Stroessner existed. The education system doesn’t mention the dictatorship. There is no intention of teaching the past so that it doesn’t repeat itself.”Paraguay’s relationship with its troubled past was thrust into the spotlight in September, by the discovery of human remains at a house once owned by Stroessner.The remains are still under analysis to determine if they are from victims of the dictatorship, said Dr Rogelio Goiburú, head of the justice ministry’s department for historical memory and reparation.Goiburú has every reason to want to uncover the truth about the dictatorship’s crimes: his own father was murdered by Stroessner’s regime.“All imaginable crimes were committed under Stroessner,” he said.Political opponents were forcibly disappeared, young girls were sexually enslaved  by high-ranking officials, members of the LGTB community were targeted and indigenous peoples faced violence that has been labelled as genocide.A 2008 report from the Paraguayan Truth and Justice Commission found that at least 423 people were murdered, 18,722 tortured and 3,470 forced into exile during the dictatorship.“In reality, thousands of people were probably killed,” said Goiburú.Yet so far, the remains of only 37 victims have been found – and just four have been identified. Although names of hundreds of perpetrators were revealed to the commission, only a handful have been prosecuted.Goiburú says the government does not give his department the resources, pointing to his tiny, flood-prone office as an indicator of how much politicians value his work.Opposition senator Esperanza Martínez, who opposed the dictatorship, said authorities refuse to address the past because the regime is still alive and well.“The end of the dictatorship was really just a reshuffle of the same old system by the protagonists of the regime itself,” she said. “They left the same political and economic models intact.”Unlike Chile, Paraguay rewrote its constitution after the fall of the dictatorship, but the conservative Colorado party – a key pillar of Stroessner’s regime – has held the presidency for 25 of the 30 years since the beginning of free multi-party elections. The current president, Mario Abdo Benítez, is the son of Stroessner’s personal secretary.In September, Colorado legislators showed allegiance to their old chief by blocking a law that identified the Stroessner era as a dictatorship.Rojas said post-dictatorship governments have done effectively nothing to recover this ill-gotten land, and instead have implemented policies that favour further concentration at the expense of the small-scale farmer and indigenous sectors.Against the backdrop of recent political upheavals across South America, Robles said that Paraguay’s immense economic, political and social imbalances are simply unsustainable.“It’s true that Paraguay is far behind in comparison to Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia, where people protest openly. But at some point, our economic and social reality is going to have to explode. Not yet, but it will explode.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8efbc520ac10c584a8e8132ef569ea21c124a56/254_386_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beabfd2ad2f02431aeca2460ccddf63e","title":"the country faces a bright future finland readers on their new pm","story":"We asked readers in Finland to share their thoughts on the country’s new prime minister.

She is well educated, bright and does not take any BS from anybody. She is a strong independent woman and a bright new star for her generation. I’m sure she will make a good example for all the young men and women of our world. It’s the young people that need to take over as they are the ones living here long after my generation has passed. Veikko, 65, Ilomantsi, FinlandI cannot recall when politics last made me cry tears of happiness. This did. I experienced my political awakening at age 16. The power that rose from the 2015 elections four years later didn’t look like me. This, now, is what politics is supposed to look like. It is supposed to look into the future, think of the welfare of the people. Ella Kivisaari, student, Helsinki, FinlandShe’s going to have a challenging time finding a way to fund government spending and find a path to improving employment. She’s fresh, popular and brings a major improvement in communication skills but also needs to break her ties with her predecessor Antti Rinne to be able to avoid an impression of being a marionette of his. Ilkka Kivi, 48, works in IT, Espoo, FinlandBest choice for prime minister. Our political party has long needed ‘fresh air’. Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn’t hesitate to say her opinion. I’m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I’m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, FinlandShe seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damskägg, 28, student, HelsinkiI first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland’s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, TampereI’m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she’s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyväskylä, FinlandIt’s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We’ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin’s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both ‘normal jobs’ as well as politics are being questioned and I’m quite sure this wouldn’t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I’m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance.

Photograph: Alan Betson Water quality in the State’s rivers and lakes is getting worse, with just 20 rivers having “pristine” conditions last year, down from more than 500 in the 1980s, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study has found.The Water Quality in Ireland 2013-2018 report, published on Tuesday, states that just 52.8 per cent of surface water – which includes rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters – was found to be in “satisfactory ecological health”. The remaining 47.2 per cent was deemed to be in a moderate, poor or bad ecological state.The EPA described as “of very significant concern” a finding that the number of “pristine river sites” had fallen to 20, which it said was at “an all-time low”.The report notes a “dramatic loss” of sites with what is deemed “best of the best” river water. Some 13.4 per cent of sites were pristine in the period 1987-1990 compared with just 0.7 per cent of sites examined from 2016 to last year.“These sites are important reservoirs of aquatic bioersity and their decline is worrying,” said Shane O’Boyle of the EPA, one of the report’s authors.The loss of pristine rivers was accompanied by a rise in the number of seriously polluted rivers, the “worst of the worst”, from six to nine, a reversal of a trend the EPA said had been moving in the other direction for many years.EPA director Matt Crowe said the State was not only failing to improve overall water quality but was also failing to prevent the further deterioration of rivers.Surface waterThe findings are based on an analysis of biological and environmental data collected from 3,217 water bodies – 2,703 surface water sites and 514 groundwater sites between 2013 and last year.The number of places where surface water was deemed to be of a good or higher quality declined by 4.4 per cent since the last major assessment was carried out between 2005 and 2010.The report found just 50.5 per cent of lake water was of a good or high ecological condition, while the figure for good or high quality water in estuaries and coastal waters was 80 per cent. A total of 92 per cent of groundwater bodies, 474 out of 514, were found to be in good chemical and quantitative condition. Groundwater is present beneath the ground in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations.Mr O’Boyle said while 80 per cent of coastal waters were of a “good” or “high” ecological status, and 92 per cent of groundwater was of “good chemical and quantitative status”, the decline in river water and the failure to improve the quality of about half of the State’s lake water, placed Ireland in breach of its obligations under the EU Water Directive.“A new sense of urgency is now needed to address the issues affecting water quality particularly in relation to agriculture and other land management practices which are key drivers behind the recent increases in nitrates and phosphorus that we are seeing in our rivers and lakes and the increasing inputs of these nutrients to our marine environment,” the report states.Nutrients from agriculture are considered a significant pressure in about 50 per cent of vulnerable watercourses, while waste water from urban treatment plants and domestic septic tanks is considered a significant pressure in about 29 per cent of vulnerable waters.Mary Gurrie, water programme manager with the EPA, said these excess nutrients come from human activities and that “we need to address the sources and the pathways by which these nutrients make their way into our rivers and lakes” ."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4109996.1575937258!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"where are ireland s most polluted rivers and lakes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“We need to address the sources and the pathways by which these nutrients make their way into our rivers and lakes. Good water quality is essential for out health and well-being”Water quality in Ireland is getting worse after a long period of “relative stability and improvement”, a six-year study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded.Among the data gathered by the EPA for the report were the names Ireland’s “worst of the worst” water courses, which included nine river sites, 10 lakes and six estuaries.The river sites include two sections of the Avoca river in Co Wicklow. The river is polluted by from the legacy of the Avoca mines, which closed in 1982. It is also polluted on lower stretches from decades of raw sewage from Arklow, which enters the river untreated in the absence of a waste-water treatment plant. Irish Water said a treatment facility is planned.The other rivers are:* The Aughboy in Co Wexford, which the EPA said is “under pressure from agriculture, domestic waste water and urban run-off”.* The Ahavarraga stream in Co Limerick, which has been noted for excess nutrients since 2015.* The Kilmihil stream in Co Clare, which is being affected by waste water.* The Kilgolgan river in Galway, which is under pressure from urban waste-water pressures form Loughrea.* The Owenriff river in Co Galway, where run-off of phosphate fertiliser from forestry has been linked to poor ecological standards and had an impact on fish populations.*\u0026nbspBallaghdoo in Co Donegal, where “discharges of a toxic nature” are suspected as the cause of this deterioration.* Roechrow in Co Donegal, where excess nutrients have been identified.According to the EPA four of the rivers – the Ahavarraga, Kilmihil, Ballaghdoo and Roechrow – have either been in bad or poor status since they were first assessed under the EU’s Water Framework Directive in 2009.Two of the rivers have declined since the last assessment, the Kilgolgan river, which was previously moderate, and the Owenriff, which was previously deemed to be in good ecological condition.Worst lakesThe 10 “worst of the worst” lakes are: Lough Alewnaghta which straddles the borders of counties Clare and Galway Ballyquirke Lough in Co Galway Lough Corglass in Co Cavan Lough Egish in Co Monaghan Lough Lickeen in Co Clare Lough Macnean Lower in counties Cavan and Fermanagh Muckno or Blayney in Co Monaghan Lough Naglack in Co Monaghan Lough Rinn in Co Leitrim and Templehouse in Co Sligo.The estuaries under pressure are Lough Donnell in Co Clare Cuskinny Lake in Co Cork Kilkerran Lake in Co Cork Rogerstown Estuary in Co Dublin Lady’s Island Lake in Co Wexford and Ballyteige Lagoon in Co Wexford.The EPA\u0027s director of evidence and assessment, Matt Crowe, said the findings of the Water Quality Ireland Report 2013-2018 suggest that “positive trends have been reversed”, with the declining health of the State’s rivers a matter of “very serious concern” .“Unfortunately this important natural resource is under threat from a range of human activities that cause water pollution and impact on the physical integrity of water bodies and water habitats,” the report says.It notes agriculture, waste-water discharges, alterations to river flows and forestry, as well as pressures caused by peat extraction, mining and quarrying, are all having a negative impact on the health of water in Ireland.“These activities, together with climate change, continue to threaten the quality and availability of water.”Mary Gurrie, water programme manager with the EPA, said the overall increase in nutrient concentrations “is one of the most worrying developments for water quality”.She said “excess nutrients come from human activities, predominantly our farms and waste water”.“We need to address the sources and the pathways by which these nutrients make their way into our rivers and lakes. Good water quality is essential for out health and well-being.”Minister for Local Government Eoghan Murphy said he welcomed aspects of the report showing “progress is being made”, but that he was “concerned” adverse trends previously reported by the EPA were continuing.“It is now more important than ever that all sectors engage in this increasingly urgent situation and reduce their impact on water quality by delivering the necessary improvements in a timely and efficient way.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Warning follows theft of 36 beef carcases from Northern Ireland food businessSophisticated activity saw Irish travel documents forged for distribution across EuropeCouncil site to be developed in joint venture with private builder AdwoodFather of two was a \u0026lsquopopular lecturer and entertaining newspaper columnist\u0026rsquoCourting Disaster calling on Government to fund a dedicated court in Dublin city centreGirl\u0026rsquos father instructed scout leaders to take her to hospital but they refused , court toldP\u0026aacutedraig O\u0026rsquoReachtag\u0026aacutein, who helped a patient escape an abusive relationship, describes his experiencesGroups call for measures to tackle community unemployment such as quotas, internshipsArmed garda\u0026iacute stop suspect\u0026rsquos car which earlier was in collision with two patrol carsTrinity, NUIG and Maynooth secure funding from \u0026lsquogold standard\u0026rsquo of academic researchMan in 40s injured in blaze in Ballyeden, near EnniscorthyIreland climbs from \u0026lsquovery low\u0026rsquo to \u0026lsquolow performer\u0026rsquo status in performance indexKilcock picket comes as latest Irish Farmers\u0026rsquo Association protests enter fourth dayStatus Yellow wind warning will remain in place until 4pm on TuesdayMan believed to have been armed with a gun carried out the robbery at 5am on TuesdayNorway tops the rankings, with the UK in 15th placeT\u0026aacutenaiste rejects Johnson\u0026rsquos claim that checks will not be needed on goodsSporting body to meet with sponsors SSE Airtricity to discuss revelations of \u0026euro55m debtEPA report says water quality in rivers and lakes \u0026lsquoof very significant concern\u0026rsquoContractor sought to manufacture and supply uniforms at a cost of about \u0026euro900 each"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4110813.1575981105!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explainer why are border checks back in the news","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has been playing down the extent of checks needed. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesWhy has the issue of border checks on goods become controversial in the UK election debate? Under the agreement hammered out in Brussels, Northern Ireland was to have a special position after Brexit, retaining the rules of the EU single market in a number of areas but remaining part of the UK customs territory. This was designed to avoid the need for physical infrastructure and controls at the Irish Border. However, how exactly it would operate was left to be worked out after Brexit takes place by a new joint committee. The issue that has become controversial is what checks and bureaucracy would be needed on goods going from Northern Ireland to Britain and vice versa. You won’t be surprised to hear that this isn’t straightforward.How has it come up in the election?UK prime minister Boris Johnson has been playing down the extent of the checks needed, saying on Sky at the weekend that there was “ no question” of checks being needed on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK before pulling back slightly in subsequent comments.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn produced documents from the UK treasury which pointed out that checks would be needed in some cases, as well as more form-filling by businesses – and also that much of this would depend on what future trade deal was completed between the EU and UK. In other words, Johnson was talking nonsense. On Monday, Tánaiste Simon Coveney underlined that checks would be needed on goods coming from Britain into Northern Ireland and that some bureaucracy would affect companies sending goods from the North to Britain, notably the need to file export declaration forms. The DUP has said that the deal is a betrayal by Johnson of previous commitments to Northern Ireland.But it was surely clear from when the deal was done that some checks would be needed?Yes. Goods coming from Britain into the North were always going to be subject to checks under the deal, even if the full workings of this were still to be agreed – and the EU side had promised to keep it to a minimum. The point is that if there was to be no need for checks at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, goods including food and animals would have to be checked at Northern Ireland ports and airports. This is to ensure customs rules were adhered to, including the necessary tariffs being paid, the origin of products confirmed and assurance that health and safety rules were fully met. Otherwise goods could enter the EU single market from the Britain – no longer a member of the EU – unchecked. The requirement for goods going the other way from the North to the rest of the UK would be less – because the UK government has committed to not undertaking physical checks. But the North’s businesses would still have to fill out additional documentation, which would be costly for SMEs which account for two thirds of the the value of this trade. And the UK treasury document does raise the question of whether some physical checks might be needed.There is this level of uncertainty because the withdrawal deal was changed quickly, late in the negotiations and there still isn’t full clarity about how it will work. In the meantime, trade experts have pointed out the complications. One of the trickiest is that goods entering the North from the rest of the UK will be subject to whatever tariffs – or special import taxes – apply on goods entering the UK from the EU. Businesses in the North will be able to claim refunds on these tariffs, but how exactly this will all work has still to be decided – and administration will be complicated.When does it need to be working by?If the UK leaves under the withdrawal agreement, a transition period – when not much changes – is due to last until the end of 2020. It can be extended, though Johnson has said this won’t happen. So unless he does a U-turn, the new procedures on the North would need to be ready to go then. This is difficult, because at the same time the EU and UK will be trying to agree what trade arrangements will apply in the long term. And the shape of this wider deal will have a direct impact on the special arrangements for Northern Ireland.The Conservatives have said they want to erge from EU rules and do new trade deals with the US and others. This would make operating the new arrangements for the North all the more difficult. A move to a softer Brexit would remove some, though not all, of the complications."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4110645.1575968774!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland has third highest quality of life in world says un report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland has a life expectancy of 82 years.

Photograph: ITVPA WireBoris Johnson’s claim that checks will not be needed on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Britain under the terms of his Brexit deal have been rejected by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Mr Coveney said inspections would have to take place on goods moving in both directions under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the British prime minister struck with the European Union. Mr Johnson has been accused of lying to voters on the issue ahead of Thursday’s general election after repeatedly saying that there would be no checks as the North would remain part of the UK customs territory. He subsequently said there would be some, but these would apply only to items destined for the Republic.DUP leader Arlene Foster yesterday said that before the latest version of the deal was announced in October, she and her deputy Nigel Dodds were informed by British Revenue and Customs that goods coming from Britain to the North would face customs checks under the agreement. ChecksSpeaking in Brussels, Mr Coveney said: “Goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland will need to have some checks to ensure that the EU knows what is potentially coming into their market through Northern Ireland.“Goods going the other way from NI into Great Britain will have far less requirement for checks at all . . . The British government has indicated that they want frictionless or unfettered access for goods originating in Northern Ireland going into the rest of the UK single market.” Mr Coveney also cast doubt on the likelihood of a deal on the future relationship between the EU and the UK being hammered out before the end of next year during the Brexit transition period. “That’s possible but there’s an awful lot to do in a relatively short space of time if that is to be achieved,” he said. Former British attorney general Dominic Grieve yesterday told The  that Mr Johnson is “simply not telling the truth” when he claims that there will be no checks on the Irish Sea after Brexit. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell agreed with Ms Foster that Mr Johnson’s claims on the issue could not be trusted. Mr Johnson yesterday faced accusations that he is uncaring after he refused to look at a photograph of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on the floor of an overcrowded hospital emergency department. Questioned about the incident during a visit to Sunderland, Mr Johnson took ITV reporter Joe Pike’s phone and put it in his pocket rather than look at the picture.The photograph, first published by the Daily Mirror, showed Jack Williment-Barr, who was thought to have pneumonia, lying on a pile of coats on the floor at Leeds General Hospital with an oxygen mask at his side because all beds were occupied.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

No doubt the fallout will continue to unfold as more information becomes known, he said.Mr Pollock expressed grief at the loss of Mr Marshall-Inman.I\u0027ve known this young man since he was three years old…. He put his all into the task at hand with his superlative people skills and broad smile coming to the fore… Sadly, this effervescent man\u0027s life has come to an end being the first deceased to be identified.I can\u0027t imagine what his family is going through… My heart and thoughts go out to them in this most difficult of times.At 10.22pm local time Tuesday New Zealand Police confirmed that a sixth person had died as a result of the explosion on White Island, also known by its Maori name of Whakaari.The deceased had been evacuated and treated at Middlemore Hospital but died of their injuries.Earlier in the day Deputy Commissioner John Tims announced a criminal investigation into the deaths would be conducted, along with a WorkSafe New Zealand investigation.Health Department spokesperson Dr Pete Watson said 27 of the 31 rescued people had suffered severe burns.There are still eight people missing.General Election 2019: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s chances are \u0026#39dire\u0026#39, shadow cabinet minister says in leaked tapeFrance endures second day of mass pension protests as Macron government approaches \u0026#39moment of truth\u0026#39Is volcanic activity on the rise because of climate change – and if so, where\u0026#39s next?Parole board ordered to reconsider approval to release Helen McCourt\u0026#39s killer despite his refusal to reveal what he did with her bodyComment: John Ashworth and the Labour \u0026#39moderates\u0026#39 are playing a foolish game by pretending Corbyn can\u0026#39t winGrenfell fire officer who ended \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 instructions promoted to London Fire Brigade\u0026#39s top jobWinter solstice 2019: Why do pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year?Comment: Labour cannot be trusted with the NHS.

The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.130 Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, ParisIt\u0027s the mysteriously serene smile of this painting\u0027s subject – thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant – that has given it universal fame. The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say.

A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.They said the work appealed to them because “people who usually would not have been so interested in art wanted to see ‘the banana’. It has opened the floodgates and morphed into an important debate about the value we place on works of art and objects in general.”The Coxes compared the piece to Andy Warhol‘s Campbell Soup Cans, pointing out that people laughed at that work, too, when it first emerged.\u0026nbspBanksy unveils new street art in Birmingham highlighting homelessnessMadonna’s daughter Lourdes part of simulated orgy at fashion showMan eats banana ‘artwork’ which was about to be sold for over £100,000“We see the piece as a unicorn of the art world, and bought it to ensure that it would be accessible to the public forever, to fuel debate and provoke thoughts and emotion in a public space in perpetuity”.\u0026nbspThe banana will apparently be replaced once every two days “when it’s ripe”.\u0026nbspAs well as causing a stir in its own right, the banana artwork became the subject of sabotage when it was eaten by performance artist David Datuna. Another performance artist, Rod Webber, spray-painted “Epstein didn’t kill himself” across the bare wall in the gallery where the banana had been displayed.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During the interview, which was recorded in November, Thayil said that Soundgarden had been unable to finish and release recordings made by Cornell and the band prior to his death.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn her suit, Vicky Cornell describes Thayil’s comments as an “unlawful attempt to strong-arm Chris’ estate into turning over certain audio recordings created by Chris before he passed away.”She says the songs in question were “solely authored by Chris contain Chris’ own vocal tracks and were bequeathed to Chris’ estate”. She also adds that “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in royalty payments are “indisputably owed” to her and the couple’s children.Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of the decade – 2010 to 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. In a statement published on\u0026nbspher Instagram, Cornell wrote: “This was not the way I would have chosen to move forward. But I will not be pushed aside for someone else’s convenience or gain.“I will not sacrifice our children’s futures for someone else’s greed. And I will not let someone else make me feel shame because the man I loved was taken from all of us too soon.”Metallica, Soundgarden and more perform at Chris Cornell tribute showChris Cornell’s widow sues the rock star’s doctor over his deathChris Cornell’s daughter releases duet in moving tribute She continued:\u0026nbsp“I will do justice by my husband’s work and memory for our children and for everything we stood for. I want to thank everyone who has stood by Chris and has supported us through this devastating time. Your love and your kindness will never be forgotten.”Cornell was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on 18 May, 2017. A coroner ruled that the cause of death was suicide.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The messy display is the culmination of a weekend of festivities where first years say thank you to their more senior student parents for mentoring themOne two-year T-level is considered a full educational programme and is considered the same as studying three A-levels, with the top grade, a Distinction*, the same as scoring three A*s at A-level.\u0026nbspLearners who complete a T-level programme with a starred distinction will be allocated the same amount of Ucas tariff points as students pursuing the more traditional qualification.\u0026nbspThe report warns: “Universities are free to decide whether they will accept T-levels and there were questions as to whether Russell Group institutions will accept T-levels.“Linked to this, decisions made by Russell Group universities may influence other universities and could tarnish T-levels in the minds of parentscarers.”Researchers add that a number of “challenges” remain with T-levels – including the “tight timescale” for developing the qualifications and the late availability of the full specifications.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So too should be the lamentable state of 16-19 education funding in general.”The Department for Education (DfE) has previously said that the new technical courses have been developed in collaboration with employers and businesses. As well as classroom study, the qualifications include a work placement of at least 315 hours – or about 45 days.National Foundation for Educational Research\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That in turn is meant to allow those ads to be scrutinised and seen by the public, since they may only otherwise show on a limited number of feeds.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Ad Library has become a key tool for journalists and transparency campaigners, who can examine the claims being made on social media by political parties and check for misleading or false sponsored posts.But now many of the ads that were being collected in that tool are simply not showing, as Sky News first reported. It means that not only could there be inidual ads that would be of interest to researchers but are now hidden, but also that any analysis of the overall ad campaigns will be wrong.Created with Sketch.General election: On the campaign trail Show all 107Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits a Christmas market in SalisburyLiberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson on the election campaign bus on route to ChelmsfordLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn talking to a university worker outside BirkbeckSOAS University of London, at the announcement of his parties of the plan for the extension of workers\u0027 rightsNicola Sturgeon plays a game with string during a visit to Perth and District YMCABrexit Party leader Nigel Farage picks up a copy of The Brexiteer during a visit to JPI Printers in DinningtonBoris Johnson, centre, talks to veteran James Gammer as he visits a veterans centreSNP supporters meet  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon following her address during a St Andrews day election speech Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson during a visit to the Cardiff United SynagogueBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage reacts as he attends an election debateJeremy Corbyn wears a jacked displaying Labour\u0027s slogan \u0027For the many, not the few\u0027Prime Minister Boris Johnson on The Andrew Marr ShowNicola Sturgeon plays with local children during a visit to the Jelly Tots \u0026amp Cookies Play Cafe in Uddingston, South LanarkshireOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn eats some chips in Whitby, northern EnglandBoris Johnson and Conservative MP George Eustice, left, tour \u0027Rodda\u0027s Clotted Cream\u0027 whilst campaigning in CornwallJo Swinson during a visit to Dunkertons Cider Company, an organic and plastic free brewery in CheltenhamJeremy Corbyn holds up unreacted documents with NHS staff.

I think middle-class graduates – remainy people – Labour’s doing well among… but not in big enough numbers to deny the Tories a majority.Most polls agree with Mr Ashworth\u0027s assessment, though some point to a possible hung parliament, particularly if tactical voting is taken into account.

After rejecting Theresa May’s deal (too soft), then Boris Johnson’s deal (hard, but with an unacceptable Irish Sea border), they returned to Belfast, with their tails between their legs.In this election, again they’re asking voters to give them a mandate to go and influence the Westminster government - without so much as a hint of irony. The truth is they won’t be hugely punished.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPolitics in Northern Ireland remains deeply tribal, and many unionists will still back their biggest party for fear of splitting the vote\u0026nbspand handing a victory to what they see as the other side. The DUP are also attempting to distance themselves from Boris Johnson’s betrayal over the unpopular Brexit deal.So while Sinn Fein will take a fistful of seats along the border, the DUP will still\u0026nbspromp home in many of its safe constituencies.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75But in some seats, Remainers are giving them a run for their money. As many as 60 per cent of voters in Belfast wanted to remain in the EU, yet aside from Sinn Fein in West Belfast, the other three seats in the city are held by the DUP. This week, the pro-Remain parties of Northern Ireland hope to change that.For 20 years, North Belfast has been the seat of Nigel Dodds, DUP grandee and their leader at Westminster. He is being challenged here by Sinn Fein’s John Finucane - the current Lord Mayor of Belfast and the son of solicitor Pat, who was murdered by loyalist gunmen in his\u0026nbspfamily home in 1989.\u0026nbsp“I grew up in North Belfast and it was pretty much as safe a unionist seat as you could get,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbsp“But I think that’s different now because society has moved on, and there’s a regressive brand of politics that they want to leave behind. People want to remove those very loud Brexiteer voices who are not representative.”Mr Dodds has a majority of 2,081, but with the SDLP and Greens not running against Sinn Fein, this seat is in a virtual dead heat. Mr Finucane is working hard to win over people who wouldn’t normally vote for his party. As Irish republicans, Sinn Fein abstain from taking their seats in the House of Commons (seven at the last election), but he believes this position has never been easier to justify, given the chaos that has played out at Westminster.“The Brexit project is very much an English nationalist project, and they’re entitled to have that,” he explains. “There is a momentum that will be forcing this through no matter how much damage it will cause here in Belfast or across Northern Ireland.“For those who backed Remain, or have come around to backing Remain since 2016, protection for them has come from Dublin, Brussels, Washington DC, and protection is never going to come from the green benches of Westminster.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr Finucane describes Mr Dodds as the arch-Brexiteer\u0026nbspof Northern Ireland, having been part of the Vote Leave campaign. “People see this as a real opportunity to send a powerful message beyond Belfast that we rejected, and continue to reject, Brexit.”What does the Sinn Fein-SDLP electoral pact in mean for Brexit?In South Belfast, the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly (with a majority of 1,996) is under threat from a nationalist who would take up her seat in Westminster. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna says people are feeling “disenfranchised and unheard” in the Brexit debate, and she wants to change that.“There are some crazy things being said in Westminster about Ireland and Brexit, and there’s nobody there to correct them,” she says. “There are many people who may have voted Sinn Fein in the past, but who now see a situation where we have votes coming down to a handful of MPs, and that protecting Ireland’s interests should come ahead of party ideology.”Indeed both Sinn Fein and the Greens have stood aside in this seat to aide Ms Hanna’s fight against the DUP, who she says have left Northern Ireland in an “unequivocally worse position” than when they entered the confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservatives in 2017.“They had an incredible amount of power and influence, and they had the opportunity to use it to positive effect for people in Northern Ireland and they chose not to.”\u0026nbspThe DUP have dug themselves into a Brexit-shaped hole, first by backing it in spite of the ever-increasing Remain consensus\u0026nbspin Northern Ireland, then by rejecting Theresa May’s deal in favour of a harder one, then by rejecting Boris Johnson’s harder deal once they saw it would be damaging to the union.“They have yet to articulate a form of Brexit that matches both their red lines and the red lines of the people who live here and don’t want a hard border,” says Ms Hanna. “Perhaps it’s dawning on them that you can have a hard Brexit or you can have the union but you can’t have both.”Arguably the SDLP’s strongest asset, Ms Hanna - a Stormont MLA who has even been endorsed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar - looks poised to take this seat and ensure her party’s return to Westminster. Nevertheless, she is well aware that Northern Ireland MPs cannot reroute Brexit alone.“We’ve got to roll with the punches in terms of what is on the table after the election,” she admits. “If there happens to be a majority of parties other than the Conservatives, then a People’s Vote is our preferred next step.”But it’s not just nationalists like Sinn Fein and the SDLP who are lining up to take on the DUP - this extends to all the pro-Remain parties, including the Alliance Party. Neither nationalist nor unionist, Alliance is a centre-ground party, increasingly representative of the other\u0026nbspconstituency in Northern Ireland, who are not committed either way on the constitutional question.The slow but steady growth of Alliance was evident in local council elections earlier this year, as well as the election of party leader Naomi Long as one of the region’s three MEPs. She is taking on the DUP’s Gavin Robinson in East Belfast (with a majority of 8,474), a seat which she previously held from 2010 to 2015, because she says the unionist party is pursuing an agenda which is not supported in the constituency.“What we’ve had from the DUP is a very extreme Brexit stance,” says Ms Long, pointing out that the party has lurched to the right as the process has gone on. “Even some of those in East Belfast who would have voted Leave feel they’re not being listened to at Westminster.”While nationalists and Others\u0026nbspin Northern Ireland have largely backed Remain, a Lucid Talk poll released in recent days showed that only 38 per cent of unionists now back Leave, with 41 per cent in favour of Remain. Support for Boris Johnson’s deal is in single digits across all communities. And it seems the DUP have already got the message. Brexit doesn’t feature at all in the party’s election broadcast, campaign literature, or their official website. Ms Long says this “speaks volumes about how wrong they have got this, and how little they want to be held to account for their decision.”Alliance must draw cross-party support to take East Belfast, but the party is not in favour of pacts. So while Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Greens have stood aside to give Ms Long a clear run here, Alliance have not exactly returned the favour. In fact, they are the only party running in all 18 of Northern Ireland’s constituencies - and with a 50-50 gender quota at that.\u0026nbsp“We are standing to be MPs for five years, and our manifesto is broader than just Brexit,” says Ms Long. “So I think it’s important that we stand and give people that choice.”Like the SDLP, Alliance are in favour of a second referendum - with Remain on the ballot. While this stance has been criticised as one which ignores the wishes of Leave voters, Ms Long argues that’s not the case.“I’ve never patronised people who voted Leave,” she says, “but what they were promised in 2016 was a kind of unicorn Brexit which would be all things to all people, and what we’re now getting is a lame donkey Brexit under Boris Johnson, and I think given that choice, some people may decide that they would prefer to keep things as they are.A seat-by-seat guide to the general election in Northern Ireland“They should have the opportunity to change their mind just as the prime minister himself has done on numerous occasions on this issue.”As election day approaches, it seems likely that the SDLP will take South Belfast, although it will be a harder fight for Alliance in East Belfast. But if there’s only one Northern Ireland seat to keep your eye on, it’s Dodds v Finucane in North Belfast. A win for Sinn Fein here would be a major victory, and its loss would be devastating for the DUP.As with so many seats across the UK, the success of pro-Remain candidates in Northern Ireland will lie entirely in people’s willingness to vote tactically to send a message to the DUP, and elect more voices who will reflect the pro-EU majority.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sending strength and solidarity your way. Now, let’s get this grimy dude and warn the women in his life.”Ms Bozarjian was covering the annual Savannah Bridge Run on Saturday when the incident happened.Robert Wells, director of the Savannah sports council, promised to find the runner and take action.“Alex, what happened today is 100 per cent unacceptable,” Mr Wells said. “You have my assurance we will identify him.“This will not be tolerated at our events.

South Korean jubilation at knocking out the mighty Germans last year.Yet none happened here where the sport began. In fact, not since  — when Bobby Moore held aloft the Jules Rimet trophy — has our great nation hosted the World Cup.It’s time for football to come home. That’s why,elected, I’ll put our Government machine at the heart of a UK and Ireland  World Cup bid.This is about more than staging the tournament. I want it to transform le chances. SoI’m elected next week, I’ll invest £million in order that, within ten years, everyone in England will be, on average, within  minutes of a great local pitch.Above all, I want it to unite us in celebration like the  Olympics did when I was London’s Mayor.I want it to show our national confidence as we get Brexit done: a sign to the world that whilst we are a small country, we’re a great one with a proud history and a strong future.Because, let’s be honest, for the past three and a half years politicians have squabbled over Brexit rather than delivering it — going round in circles rather than focusing on our schools, hospitals and keeping our streets safe.That’s why I had to call the election and why I’m asking Sun readers to visit their local polling station next week.  As you do, cast your mind back five weeks to the endless shouting in parliament. And then imagine five more years of it.In le, as in football, there are moments. Moments when you have to choose. Moments when things come together — or when they fall apart.Moments that define history and set the course of the future.We all remember Gareth Southgate’s heartfelt celebrations last summer and that Eric Dier penalty.We slightly overlook how close the keeper was to saving it. Thankfully he didn’t and we put years of penalty heartbreak behind us.In politics, one of those moments is coming next Thursday.We can either deliver Brexit and move forward with a Conservative majority Government, or we can have more Brexit delay, more arguing in Parliament, and two more referendums in  under Jeremy Corbyn. Next Thursday, I’m asking many dferent people to come on a journey with me. People who always vote Conservative. People who used to but lost faith. People who never have before.All of you who do are putting your trust in me. And I don’t take that lightly at all. Yet I feel so positive about our future as a country outside the EU. There’s so much we can achieve as well as lots we need to improve too.It won’t always be easy. We won’t always agree. But together I really believe we can do it. So come with me on that journey. Let’s unleash our potential. Let’s get Brexit done. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear how preposterous the audience found it.He then claimed, absurdly, that socialism has a better record than capitalism for raising the poor’s living standards.That will be news to Venezuela, which Corbyn once hailed as an ideal ­economic model but which is now a ­living hell of starvation and squalor.Boris was simply more convincing and more statesmanlike. Corbyn, even in a suit, is still the same old backbench crank nursing -year-old grievances.It is incredible anyone would consider putting him in power.THE smearing of Boris as a racist by a Channel  “mistake” is an outrage.We pray it was not deliberate. The channel’s journalists make no secret of their loathing for the Tories.Its news chief branded Boris a liar and presenter Jon Snow likes to chant “f*** the Tories”.Assuming it was a genuine error, what does it say about the culture of a ­supposedly impartial TV network that no one questioned it How did this happen  TV chiefs must come clean.The channel’s apology came too late to stop Corbyn’s Twitter trolls spreading it.Six days from the most crucial election in a letime, it’s a sacking offence.IT is time for the men in white coats to wheel off John Major, Tony Blair and their europhile has-been mates to a safe space where they can gibber together out of harm’s way.Brexit derangement has so utterly confused and consumed them that they are now campaigning against a Tory victory — and thus for the only alternative: a Marxist-run Corbyn coalition.They somehow prefer the immediate economic harm and global shock of that to a stable Tory Government delivering on the majority’s democratic will.These old men simply cannot cope with their defeat three years ago and seek vengeance on those who beat them.They really are that barking. GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn would bankrupt the nation. Corbyn despises this country. Corbyn has spent a career licking the boots of terrorists. Corbyn never met a hate preacher he didn’t like.If Jeremy Corbyn gets elected on Thursday then, in the words of The Carpenters, it will be yesterday once more — and ato the ravages of gormless Socialism, red in tooth and claw, unseen since the Seventies.We have forgotten what mass unemployment is like in this country. We have forgotten what soaring inflation is like. We have forgotten what it is like to endure endless strikes. Corbyn would bring it all back — and worse.For Jeremy Corbyn has no love for this country. He has no affection for our people, our history or our flag.Personally, I couldn’t give a flying figCorbyn watches the Queen’s speech on Christmas Day.But it does bother me that he always takes the side of this country’s enemies.It concerns me that his “friends” include terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA. It disturbs me like hell that Corbyn can even find excuses for Russian thugs conducting their murderous business on British soil.Jeremy Corbyn despises the nation he seeks to lead. And that scares me most of all.Thursday will dawn cold, dark and with the possibility of snow. This close to Christmas, nobody feels like going to a polling booth. But this close to a terrorist-sympathising Marxist moron seizing power, we can’t afford NOT to vote.There are real problems that the incoming government will need to address on day one.Yes, our departure from the European Union is absolutely crucial. But no matter how much we may despise the unelected fat cats in Brussels, the nations of Europe will always be our neighbours and should always be our friends.Leaving the EU while maintaining good trading relations with it is no easy day at the office.And the new PM will have far more than Brexit to deal with. The housing crisis has made owning your own home an impossible dream for the younger generation.The pressures on our schools, roads and NHS are at breaking point. The working man and woman pay too much tax. Serious crime is rising. Climate change is real.All this is waiting in our new Prime Minister’s inbox.Jeremy Corbyn — a stupid, tenth-rate little man with stale, left-wing clichés where his brain should be — is clearly not up to the job.He is an economic cretin who would empty your pockets. He is a spineless hypocrite on Brexit. He has enabled racism to enter the bloodstream of the Labour Party. And he hates the wicked West.“What goes around comes around,” Corbyn sneered when almost , people were murdered on  .Every time there is a terrorist attack, Corbyn finds a way of saying that we had it coming.On Thursday, YOUR vote can keep the worthless old git and his deranged supporters from power.This country deserves better than Jeremy Corbyn.THE Pirelli Calendar was once the byword for lavishly shot sexiness, but it is struggling to find its role in the modern world.Pretentious pictures of Emma Watson as a po-faced nun are probably not the answer to the Italian firm’s dilemma.Next year Pirelli should just print pictures of tyres.It has to be more interesting than this pompous cobblers.HARDCORE James Bond fans have long feared that an increasingly politically correct  was becoming licensed to kill joy.Bond had started coming over all woke. Daniel Craig never needs much encouragement to moan about Bond’s old-fashioned, sexist ways, while sources have claimed that the term “Bond girls” is now banned on  film sets as it is deemed unacceptable in the modern era.All very worthy. And all light years away from the gritty, sexy essence of Ian Fleming’s iconic hero.But the good news is that the trailer for the new Bond movie, No Time To Die, dropped this week and it looks exactly like a  blockbuster should look.Evil villains dreaming of world domination. Fast cars and fast women. Fiendishly clever gadgets. Car chases that would get you nine points on your licence.AndAna de Arma is not the ultimate Bond girl, then my name is Pussy Galore.WHEN I was a child, my family would make a -mile round trip just to gawp at the Christmas wonders of London.The lights of the West End. Santa’s grotto in Selfridges.And the giant Christmas tree given to us every year since  by the nation of Norway, grateful to us for chasing out the Nazis.This year the tree in Trafalgar Square is, frankly, a bit of a disappointment.Did the Norwegians forget to water it That’s not a giant Christmas tree.It’s a big twig.I’m not sure I would go to the end of the garden to see it, let alone drive all the way from Billericay.THE Duchess of Cambridge is such a great ambassador for the Royal Family.In these dficult days, with Prince Andrew all sweaty and Prince Harry all sulky, the glorious Kate never puts a foot wrong.Look at her helping out at a charity for disadvantaged kids on a Christmas tree farm in Great Missenden, Bucks.Sometimes I think that, after the Queen has gone, there is no future for the monarchy in modern Britain.But then I look at Kate – always smiling, always gracious – and I change my mind.WHEN BBC-approved comedian Nish Kumar appeared at The Lord’s Taverners Christmas Lunch he was booed off stage and narrowly dodged a bread roll.Nish made the mistake of trotting out lame anti-Brexit quips that would have had the canned laughter turned up to ten on any BBC  show.This material doesn’t work so well in the real world.The Lord’s Taverners is a cricket charity that supports children living in poverty or with disability. A very good cause.But the audience at their Christmas beano had no appetite for jokes about evil Tories. Although jokes about evil Tories will get your contract renewed at the BBC.Nish, the host of The Mash Report – me neither – told the audience: “I should have known this would happen when I agreed to do a set in front of people who colonised my ancestors.”Desperate stuff, Nish.I very much doubtanyone at that charity lunch colonised anyone’s ancestors.One of these BBC-approved comics should do a stand-up routine on Diane Abbott’s mathematics.Or the Labour Party’s inability to elect a woman leader in  years.This is all worthy of biting satire!But then they would never be asked back on Mock The Week, or The Mash Report nor any of the Beeb’s dreary, joyless, biased crap.Nish Kumar’s humiliation in the real world begs the question: Why should we all pay the BBC £. a year for a licence fee when it only represents the views of some of us Kumar – and all of these BBC-approved comedians – should stay in Broadcasting House.They will be safe there – Nish, Dara O Briain, Sandi Toksvig, Jo Brand and all the rest.They should never go into the real world.Someone might chuck a bread roll at them.PRINCE WILLIAM says he “recycles as much as he can”.Any chance of leaving his beleaguered uncle, the Duke of York, out for the bin men If Andrew is as innocent as he claims in his dealings with child-abusing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, then he should go to the United States and do whatever it takes to clear his name.Until he does so, the former Randy Andy is an embarrassment to his family.And his country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we are also their role models in terms of food choices. If we breakfast on Pringles, pizza and doughnuts then the odds are they will too.By the same token,we start the day with porridge, seeds and fruit, they’ll likely grow up assuming that’s the best way.School is a huge influence, too, and it is great Jamie did succeed. In fact, he started a nationwide trend of schools providing and promoting a healthy diet.But some schools are taking it too far. At one primary I know of, teachers and dinner ladies patrol the lunchtime tables hunting out contraband such as sugary drinks and chocolate, to confiscate it then attempt to shame the parents into submission with letters about their snack misdemeanours.Other schools, it has emerged, are taking it even further than that, with pupils being followed when school has ended.Yes, following them from the school gates to the high street to intervenethey are seen going into a takeaway.Children at Cotham School, in Bristol, have been told they are not allowed to enter at least three convenience stores and a takeaway between .pm and .pm.Not only that, but school staff acting as bouncers have been patrolling the shopping parade and standing in high-vis jackets outside the chippy.The school says it is using powers given by Michael Gove’s  Education Act, which allows it to rule over the conduct of pupils in certain circumstances outside the school gates.The school’s business manager, Allison Crossland, said teachers have the authority over what the pupils do even after the end of the school day.And they are doing so to, “ensure the safety of children on their way home from school”.According to one takeaway owner, teachers went inside and started giving out detentions to children they found in there, although the school denies this.But the takeaway shops on the street say they have seen a drop in business since Cotham School staff started patrolling the streets and, unsurprisingly, they are up in arms as a result.I’m not saying it’s great for kids to snack on high-fat or sugary food when they leave school. Of course it’s not.But is it really the responsibility of their teachers to make sure they don’t  Is it right teachers can rule on what your kids eat when they leave school I don’t think so. AndI was a parent of a child being told what to eat by someone other than me, I’d be furious.I know some people will say this comes down to money, that it’s more expensive to eat healthily.And yes, it is cheaper and easier to snack on sugary foods such as chips and biscuits.Some might say that school dinners are not satisfying enough.Parents need to take it upon themselves to learn about how to cook and eat healthily.You don’t have to spend a fortune to eat well. Look at Jack Monroe, who has written a book on how to cook well with tinned food.There is no doubt something needs to change when it comes to kids and food.The number of obese people in the UK has almost doubled in  years. Rather than paying staff to patrol the chippy, I would vote to bring back domestic science and teach all children how to cook properly from scratch.But as parents, it is our duty, and no one ’s, to look after our children and teach them how to eat well.I KNOW they were doing important work at the Nato summit and all . . . But bloody hell, it was easy for the onlooker to be distracted, wasn’t it, with all the world leaders’ power-mongering going on First of all there were the handshakes. The amount of one-upmanship that can occur in a simple greeting is staggering: Who gets to overpower who by making sure their hand is firmly on top throughout the shake.Who lets go and de-shakes first, and who insists on prolonging the handshake so enthusiastically that it is impossible for the other party to get away until the prolonger is good and ready.Donald Trump famously shakes LONG and HARD. I think it is called the Power Shake and is often employed by people who think the harder they squeeze, the more important and manly they are.They hold on to show they have control over you. But at this summit, Trump possibly met his match with Canada’s Justin Trudeau, who was repeatedly filmed gripping people’s hands so hard that both sets of knuckles were going white.Mind you, that is better than the limp shake. No one likes nor trusts someone with a limp handshake. It’s like shaking hands with a person with no bones.But my least favourite is the sweaty-palm shake.And then there was the footage of Trudeau, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson apparently gossiping about Trump like a bunch of naughty schoolboys.Where’s the leadership qualities in behaving like that It all left me feeling like they need to grow up.And then I saw the photo of our magnicent Queen and all  Nato allies. Guess how many women were in the group  I counted seven, including the Queen. I can’t help but thinkthere were more women involved, less of this childish stuff would go on.But it comes with at least one benefit: An utterly fabulous clothing budget!I have never seen Melania in the same outfit twice .She wore a coat a few months ago which I quite liked the look of, so I thought I might buy it.I looked it up online and it was £,, for something made out of wool. I passed! Mind you, whatever the cost, she looks great and oozes class.I SHUDDERED when I read the story of Jayney Nascimento, , who borrowed £, from her mother for liposuction in the hope of having skinnier legs. But instead of getting the legs of her dreams, she contracted a deadly flesh-eating bug called necrotising fasciitis, which left her fighting for her le and she almost had her legs amputated.Jayney, an administrator from Shropshire, says: “I paid for an expensive cosmetic procedure so I would feel comfortable showing off my legs.“Instead, I nearly lost them and I hate them more now than I did before the operation.”Talk about a sobering reminder that all cosmetic surgery is invasive and has potentially le-threatening side-effects. Is it really worth it I’m guessing this woman would say no.CHRISTIE Brinkley was photographed looking absolutely spectacular at an event in New York. Wearing this black, trenchcoat-style mini- dress, with bedazzling purse and sparkly calf boots she seemed about half her age, which is, incredibly, .If I have half of her joie de vivre and charisma at that age, I will be over the moon.And so should she be.POOR Rhodri Giggs, who told this week about the devastating effect brother Ryan’s affair with his we has had on the family. Quite understandably, he hasn’t spoken to footballer Ryan, , in eight years, since the affair with Rhodri’s we Natasha was revealed.But shockingly, he said his mother Lynne hasn’t spoken to him in the past eight years.Rhodri, , says she has taken Ryan’s side: “Because I haven’t got  medals, I haven’t played for Manchester United for -odd years and own a big house.”Turns out this was a triple betrayal. His we. His brother. His mother. Your entire support network gone overnight. Shame on his motherthat is true.DID anyone  wince over Jeremy Corbyn vowing to confront Donald Trump at this week’s Buckingham Palace reception It was about the sanctity of the NHS, which Trump does not appear to be interested in having anything to do with anyway.In the end, Corbyn didn’t get a chance as he was kept firmly away from the US President, possibly after publicly announcing his intentions.But the US is our main ally and it’s quite shocking that on a visit by the President, the opposition leader has to be kept away from Trump because he can’t be trusted to act with respect.What a calamity it would behe became the leader on December .JUST when I thought my admiration for black cab drivers had reached a peak, I got an invitation to a Christmas lunch organised by the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans.They offered Christmas lunch – turkey and all the trimmings – to  veterans who were taken to the venue by a fleet of black cabs driven by volunteer cabbies.It is so heart-warming that it actually brought a tear to my eye.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Haskell was big enough to pacy Wrighty, the series’ one real character, and Jenner was a waste of £, as she had everyone treading on PC eggshells and queuing up to assure us she was “an amazing, amazing woman”.Most of the rest were merely present and it was hard to have an opinion about almost any of them. Especially Adele, who had a picture of Jane McDonald rather than a personality, and Oddboddish Myles, who seemed to be using “the experience of a letime” to get his own cookery show. Not the reason most people would go in there.But a lot of this year’s contestants were young, tearful, mollycoddled, over-entitled, insecure products of our woke times and were treated accordingly by the production team, who bombarded the poor homesick little lambs with fry-ups, roast dinners, care packages, letters from home and so much food, most of them left the camp sounding like they’d just spent a fortnight at The Palms in Vegas.Roman: “That was the best thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Andy: “I loved every single minute of it.” Myles: “It’s been the most beautul time of my le.”Which was lovely for them but dull as hell for us, no matter how much they banged on about the “emotional rollercoaster ride” and missing their ruddy kids.Nor did it help Ant  Dec, who tried their brilliant best to inject laughter and running gags into the show. This, though, was one series of I’m A Celeb not even they could save.On Sunday it ended, appropriately enough, with victory for Jacqueline Jossa, who probably hoovered up the “Gloria Gaynor” block vote on account of her husband Dan Osborne’s off-screen shenanigans, which were far more interesting than anything that happened on screen.If this flat, tearful, commercially driven series got the winner it deserved, it certainly didn’t get the right epitaph from Ant.“One thing’s for sure,” he claimed confidently at the end, “We’ll never forget the class of .”And with that, I’d forgotten them.A FEW points to make regarding the BBC continuity announcer’s plug for Gemma Collins’ podcast, which kicked in during The Apprentice: You’re Fired credits.“I’ve got a great podcast to tell you about.” You haven’t.“It’s so entertaining.” It’s not.“Was Gemma Collins an elephant in a past le ” PAST FEELGOOD television story of the week Nish Kumar getting booed off stage at the Lord’s Taverners charity dinner. Proof he really hasn’t been paying attention to his Mash Report audience.If he had, Nish would’ve noticed they’re not laughing, they’re applauding in furious agreement about just how much they also hate the Tories, Boris, Trump and Brexit.Those of us who don’t share any of these left-wing prejudices, of course, are just meant to sit and meekly accept the abuse and the fact that all the least funny, most obnoxious and radioactively smug people on TV suddenly seem to have decided they’re the nation’s new moral compass and we’re racist bigots.What’s brilliant about the Lord’s Taverners story and accompanying internet footage of the audience is they refuse to play ball. At the point the clip kicks in, Nish has already lost them and is, as always, playing the race card.Half the crowd are booing, the other half are begging him to say something funny, ashe might suddenly turn into Robin Williams.A great comedian could still have turned it round and adjusted their material, of course.But Nish Kumar is neither great nor even a comedian. He’s a left-wing propagandist who cannotoutside of the tiny BBC Channel  echo chamber, so he has to be ushered off stage by the tombola bloke in red livery.It could’ve happened to any one of a number of C BBC “comedians”, obviously. The Tez O’Clock Show, The Last Leg, Have I Got News For You and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order are all just as biased and unpleasant as The Mash Report.Nish is by far the smuggest offender, though, andthe BBC is ever going to make a mass audience laugh again, instead of just lecturing us, it needs to learn the Lord’s Taverners lesson and carve these words on a comedy gravestone: “Ladies and gentlemen, Nish Kumar. It’s time for us to draw the raffle.”THE title of ITV’s It’s Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show was loaded with all sorts of obvious threats.He would sing and smirk and then sing some more.But even I wasn’t prepared for the ego, which I blame fairly and squarely on his we Ayda Field who, Robbie claimed: “Gave me the gt of loving myself.”And certainly didn’t need to keep the receipt.The comedy segments were another endurance, featuring his dad, Jamie Cullum, Ant  Dec and David Walliams, who’d dressed up as an obsessive female fan, but was nothing like as terrying as the real thing, Julie from Norfolk, who Robbie winched out of the audience for a burst of Something Stupid.

Let’s build on that, rather than wasting time by scrapping a system that works.” Meanwhile Mr Caudwell personally rounded on Mr McDonnell’s vendetta against the rich.The phone tycoon — who has vowed to leave most of his £.billion to charity — accused Labour of driving away business and jobs from Britain.He declared: “Nearly every wealthy person I know is thinking of leaving the UK — including me —Labour get in.” He said he would not have set up his business in BritainMr Corbyn was PM, in a confrontation filmed by the BBC Radio  Today Programme.Mr Caudwell said: “When I hear words like ‘nobody deserves to be a billionaire’ and phrases like, ‘we’re going to tax high technology companies’, it frightens the living daylights out of me and out of society.”He added: “I’ve paid over £million in totalyou take capital gains tax as well as income tax. I’m happy to do that because it is a contribution to society, the society that helped me be successful and a society that desperately needs my tax dollars.“In addition I spend probably at least  or  per cent of my waking hours on charitable purposes.”He added: “What you are doing as a Labour Party is destroying confidence andyou destroy confidence, nearly every wealthy person I know is thinking of leaving the UK, including meLabour get in.”Mr McDonnell desperately tried to downplay his hatred and insisted that Labour is pro-business.He said: “I applaud what you do. I have actually said I do pay tribute to those people, the entrepreneurs who create the wealth, who pay their taxes and act responsibly.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats unusual.I pulled up outside the pub and he got in. He seemed a little drunk and was carrying a glass. I said look, no drinks in the car.He kept asking why not and then said he would finish it quickly. He said he had been drinking all night and had no idea where he was.I asked him where he wanted to go and he kept saying Im not sure, Im not sure, let me get an address, just keep driving.He got out a piece of paper and showed me an address on it. It was for Manchester. I was already suspicious about his behaviour.McCann had just been involved in a high-speed police chase and crashed his car on a roundabout.He fled on foot and kept to the nearby canal before calling Kidsgrove Taxis to pick him up as cops issued an urgent appeal.April  — Walthamstow, LondonApril  — Edgware, LondonMay  — Haslingden, LancashireMay  — Ramsbottom, Greater ManchesterMay  — Heywood, Greater ManchesterMay  — Congleton, CheshireMarried Iftab said: After I picked him up I got an alert on my PDA from the office to say that a wanted man was in this area and that there were roadblocks on the nearby A.I looked in my rear view mirror and realised that he was in my cab.I took the PDA and hid it so he couldnt see that the alert had come through. He kept saying go on the M, head to the M.At that point I took a right onto the A.Thank God he didnt realise what Id done. If Id taken him on the M he would have got away and it would have been down to me.I knew there would be a roadblock and that the police would stop me.We even passed the spot where he crashed his car and he said: I wonder what happened here.I thought anything could happen here. He had a glass in his hand andneed be he could have taken me hostage.I put it to the back of my mind and came up to a roadblock on the A. The police officer looked at me and McCann said: Dont stop, whatever you do, dont stop.He was kicking the back of my chair.This meant after a minimum term of two-and-a-half years hed be freed from jail only when the Parole Board decided it was safe to do so.He was out licence from prison when he was arrested in August last year for burglary and should have been recalled to jail - allowing the Parole Board to be informed by the Probation Service about the case.But he was instead remanded into custody and then given a three-year determinate sentence, which did not take into account his earlier offending.And like London Bridge terrorist Usman Khan, McCann was then automatically freed to carry out further crimes.Following his arrest in May, the Ministry of Justice carried out a serious further offence review into McCanns case.The review is understood to have identied an error in the probation service failing to recall McCann when he committed the burglary.Of four probation staff in the South East and Eastern ision who were directly involved in McCanns supervision, one was demoted, according to PA.Jo Farrar, chief executive of HM Prisons and Probation Service, has “apologised unreservedly” for failings in the case.I pulled over and brought the car to a quick stop. The police officer jumped in and demanded to see his tattoos.He kept saying Its not me, its not me. He got out of the car and as one of the officers turned he threw the glass down and ran through a hedge.Minutes later there were about  police officers in the area and two helicopters overhead.They threw up a cordon and closed the road off. I stayed there with the police officer in the dead of night as they continued to search.It was terrying. But eventually they found him hiding up a tree.Iftab brushed off descriptions of him as a hero - adding: His victims, those who stood up in court to bring him to justice, are the real heroes.I just did the right thing - thats all. If I hadnt done what I did he would have continued doing what he was doing.I couldnt live with that - so I did what I could. I knew I was in danger buthed got away he could have killed.The cabbie blasted the sentence given to the depraved monster.He said: How is that justice  In  years, he will get a second chance at le. What of his victims  He should spend the rest of his natural le behind bars.McCann, who was branded a classic psychopath by a judge, cowered in his cell yesterday after refusing to turn up to his sentencing at Londons Old Bailey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every vote for Labour brings the Corbyn revolution a step closer.That catastrophe could easily happen this week.In recent opinion polls, the Tories have maintained a consistent lead over Labour by about  per cent - enough for a comfortable majority.But in some surveys, the gap has fallen to just  points, while one poll at the weekend suggested a Conservative majority of just .Moreover, as the last two General Elections proved, the polls can be badly wrong. The result this time could go down to the wire.What the country needs to ensure Corbyn’s defeat is a vast coalition of voters united by the one aim of keeping him out of Downing Street.This was meant to be the Brexit election but it has rightly turned into a referendum on Corbyn’s spectacular unfitness for high office.And the only result should be a wholesale rejection of his bid for power.To achieve that, all anti-Corbyn voters – no matter what their past allegiances or their personal hostility to Johnson – must vote tactically for the Conservatives.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow Chancellor John McDonnell must be stoppedThroughout the campaign, Remain supporters have talked feverishly of the potential for anti-Tory tactical voting to stop Brexit.But far more potent would be a wave of pro-Tory tactical voting to keep out Corbyn.At the heart of such a drive must lie the millions of decent, patriotic voters in Labour’s heartlands of the North and the Midlands, who have backed the party all their lives but are now profoundly disillusioned with Corbyn.If they held their noses and supported Johnson, then Labour would face annihilation.There are already signs that this could be happening.The so-called “Red Wall” of around  Labour marginals from Yorkshire to Wales, characterised by seats like Bolsover in Derbyshire and Crewe in Cheshire, appears to be crumbling.If a new army of Red Tory voters materialises on Thursday, the damage to Corbyn could be phenomenal.This week were reports that Labour are even in trouble in Leigh, where Joanne Platt has a majority of almost , and which is only th on the Tories’ target list.Similarly, the latest poll in the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby, which has been held by Labour for generations, shows a big lead for the Tories.This mood of revolt against political loyalties was captured in the words of one café worker in Labour-held Wrexham, North Wales, who said at the weekend: “I’ve always voted Labour and my family always voted Labour. On Thursday I shall be voting Tory.”People like her recognise that traditional Labour – the party of Clem Attlee, John Smith and Tony Blair – is now dead, replaced by a dogmatic, intolerant movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.The election campaign has only reinforced Labour’s unfitness for office.Lavish pledges of free services and extravagant spending increases have been dished out like confetti, shattering the last remnants of the party’s economic credibility.Meanwhile, Labour has nothing coherent to say about Brexit beyond the threat of yet more dither and delay.It is no wonder that the five million Labour voters who backed Leave in the  referendum are in such despair.Boris himself put it well on a visit to Grimsby yesterday when he said that Labour’s Brexit stance represented “the great betrayal, orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes.”But it is not just Leave voters who should back the Tories. Remainers who loathe the idea of a Corbyn regime should do so as well.A hard-left Government is too big a price for stopping Brexit, for which the British people democratically voted three years ago.The arch pro-EU Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, now standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency, said recently that he was “absolutely satisfied that Mr Corbyn would be a disaster in Downing Street.”Yet Grieve is making that dire possibility more likely by trying to siphon off votes from the Tory party.Indeed, all the opposition parties are acting as Corbyn’s allies, whatever their protestations.Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in particular, could still badly split the anti-Corbyn vote in a string of Northern and Midlands seats, like Hartlepool.The latest poll in the constituency shows the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories on  per cent, a far higher combined total of Labour’s  per cent.In Doncaster North, held by Ed Miliband, Labour is on  per cent against a combined total of  per cent for the Brexit Party and the Conservatives.Further south, a vote for Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats is realistically a vote for Corbyn, just as in Scotland, support for the SNP will help to propel Corbyn into Downing Street.The choice is stark. Our country’s security, liberty and growth can only be secured by theof a Conservative Government.There is nothing to fear from the continuation in office of Boris Johnson, who stands in the long tradition of one-nation Conservatism epitomised by Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill.But there is everything to fear from Corbyn’s ascent to power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I can’t see it happening!”When askedthere was any chance of moderate Labour MPs launching a coup to get rid of Mr Corbyn,Ashworth replied “No, because we f****d it up.This is referring to when a vote of No Confidence in the leftie-boss was passed by his own MPs in  but he refused to step down.The leak is a blow for Labour as they were hoping to give Mr Ashworth a prominent role in the closing days of the campaign as they attack the Tories on the NHS.But with the shadow health secretary already pulling out of media appearances as he faced questions over his damning comments, it places the party on the back foot.Mr Ashworth has hit back the tape and said it was just banter between two “mates”.He told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire: “I was having a bit of banter with a Tory friend of mine, at least I thought he was a friend, a Tory activist called Greig Baker.“He was like the Tories are going to lose and I said ‘no you’re going to be fine’.“Joshing as old friends do and he’s only gone and leaked it to a website.It’s a bit of joshing, because he’s an activist, it’s a bit like saying to your mate who’s a fan of a rival football team.“You’re trying to unnecessarily boost their ego and make them become complacent.“He was my friend, I went to America with this guy  years ago and he’s leaked it all – I can’t believe it.“It’s joshing around and he’s leaked it, I can’t believe it. We’re supposed to be mates.”Tory chairman James Cleverly saidMr Corbyn own “lieutenants” can’t trust him – then voters should not either.He said: “This is an honest and truly devastating assessment of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership by one of his most trusted election lieutenants.“He admits that Labour has blocked Brexit and that is why voters ‘can’t stand Corbyn’.If even Corbyn’s closest political allies think he is unfit to be Prime Minister, why on earth should voters be expected to put their trust in him and them.“Corbyn’s Labour have broken their promises to the British people on Brexit and they will not be able to deliver their fantasy manesto.“As Ashworth himself says, only a vote for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will mean we can get Brexit done.”On voters hating Jeremy CorbynHe said: “I’ve been going round these national places, it’s dire for Labour.“It’s awful for them and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit….outside of the city seats… it’s abysmal out there… they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.“I think middle-class graduates – remainy people – Labour’s doing well among… but not in big enough numbers to deny the Tories a majority.” On Mr Corbyn’s chances of reaching NoHe said: “I just can’t see it happening.“It wouldn’t surprise me – for sake of argument – we held Canterbury because of sort of middle-class, -reading people, but then the Tories take Bolsover off of Labour it wouldn’t surprise me.“The electoral map has being going topsy-turvey because of Brexit and Corbyn.” On a Labour coup to get rid of Mr Corbyn“No because we f****d it up we fucked it up in  when we went too early. People like me were internally saying ‘this isn’t the right moment’ but I got kind of ignored.“But I don’t think we’re going to get there In Mansfield, in Ashfield, it’s dire for the Labour Party up there, these traditional working areas.” On getting rid of Mr Corbynthe Tories get a majorityHe said: “That’s the thing that’s on our minds… I think things can change quickly I think things change more quickly anyway now.” On Mr Corbyn being a risk to national securityHe said: “I don’t know, on the security stuff I worked in No., I think the machine will pretty quickly move to safeguard security .“But it’s not going to happen!

Nine-month-old baby Lily had to wait on a hospital chair for hours. Our picture earlier today showed four-year-old Jack forced to sleep on a hospital floor while waiting treatment for suspected pneumonia. But the squirming Prime Minister refused to even look at the photo when confronted by a TV reporter. Confronted by a TV reporter with the image of poorly Jack from Friday’s Mirror front page, the Prime Minister repeatedly dodged it. At one point the mumbling PM even pocketed the reporter’s mobile to avoid doing so. Have you experienced a similar problem in hospital  Email webnews@mirror And in a desperate bid to limit the damage, the shame-faced PM sent Health Secretary Matt Hancock to Leeds General Infirmary where Jack was treated. But by then the story had crossed the Atlantic with CNN and the Washington Post reporting it. Jack’s plight also made headline news on the BBC, ITV and Sky. Four-year-old Jack had been rushed to Leeds General as his GP suspected he had pneumonia. It wasn’t the first time the Tory leader was confronted our story on the scandal on the worst day of his election campaign so far. And former Mirror editor Piers Morgan shared it with his .million Twitter follower saying “The, harrowing Mirror front page that Boris Johnson couldn’t bear to look at. Will it derail his election campaign ”. The shocking tale prompted Louise Webb, , to contact the mirror after her nine-month old baby, Lily, was forced to wait six hours for a bed. Louise had taken Lily to the Countess of Chester Hospital near their Ellesmere Port home, after she deteriorated following weeks of illness.  Suffering from an ear infection, vomiting and diarrhoea, the baby was badly dehydrated. Louise, Lily’s and her dad, Thomas Noden, , were signed in to AE hospital at .am last Wednesday. Yet they had to wait until am before she was seen by a doctor. It was a further hour before Lily was seen by a children’s specialist who Louise said told them: “We have not got enough beds.” Louise added: “She said, ‘You can sit in the waiting room where to wait for a bed, but that could be hours’.”  Louise and Thomas stayed up all night, with their sick baby on a chair. They took their photo at am. Louise said the overstretched medics did their best and blamed austerity for the chaos. “They have not got enough funding, they have not got enough nurses,” she said. Thankfully over the next  hours, Lily began to improve. But the experience left Louise feeling “something needs to change.” She said: “To sit in a hospital and see at first hand the situation, it really opens your eyes.” Dr Susan Gilby, chief executive at the hospital, said: “We apologise to anyone who has to wait longer than four hours. We would be very grateful to receive their feedback.” As the fall out from our story on little Jack continued Mr Johnson was met with a storm of criticism across the media and from outraged members of the public.  First he was confronted on LBC radio, then at an event at a factory on Tyneside and in the ITV interview with reporter Joe Pike. The journalist had to point out on air the PM had snatched his phone. Mr Johnson finally looked at the image which he described as a “terrible, terrible photo”. He added: “Obviously we have every possible sympathy for everybody who has a bad experience of the NHS, that’s why we’re putting a record investment into the NHS.”  But his spending claims were challenged at the factory by mum Page Hood, who said her son endured two y waits in AE in a week. She said: “No one should believe that – they’ve been in power for nine years. “I don’t understand how anyone is going to trust the Conservatives”. At a rally in Bristol Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn held aloft a copy of the Mirror, branding the image a “disgrace”. As supporters shouted “Shame on you Boris” he urged people to vote Labour to save the health service. He said: “The Tories have had nine years to fund our NHS. It’s time to bring their regime to an end.”  Mr Hancock, who had earlier called Jack’s mum to apologise, was shown our story during his visit to Leeds. “It’s not good enough and I’ve apologised,” he said. But Mr Johnson’s bad day got worse when Conservative aides invented a story that one of Mr Hancock’s team was punched by a Labour activist.

The couple were at home on December  when they received a notication on their mobile saying the parcel had been ‘handed to resident’. Confused by the message, they checked their CCTV, leaving them stunned the driver had lied.The house is located on a main road and overlooked by a four-storey block of flats making it clearly visible to passers-by, Manchester Evening News reports. Shane said it was an “absolute joke” to see the driver run away without attempting to knock. He said: “We got the notication to say it had been delivered, but we were really confused because we’d not heard the door or anything so we thought it was worth checking the camera.” Shaun added: “Thankfully, it was only a pack of vitamins that my we had ordered that cost around £, but the driver doesn’t know that. That could have been a thousand quid phone.”  Shane said the poor service has led him to feel frustrated with the company that hires drivers to deliver Amazon parcels, after having a succession of issues with ordering from the online retail giant.

The South Gloucestershire family has blamed a complete lack of signage after missing their flight from Bristol Airport to Paris and cutting short a planned trip to Disneyland. Jack Gray booked a trip to Disneyland with his five-year-old son Oliver and partner, expecting to fly out on Monday morning, BristolLive reported. Despite getting to the airport at .am, the Yate family missed the .am departure because of confusion over the queue to board. Jack said: “We were waiting for the fast-track passengers to board, but we hadn’t seen the normal passengers were queuing behind a pillar. It wasn’t signposted.” The -year-old mechanic ended up paying an extra £ for seats on the .pm flight to Paris – a price he branded “ridiculous”. Mangotsfield School pupil Oliver was left in tears, while his grandmother Helen described the family as “devastated”. Jack said: “We got checked in fine, and we were waiting around. At .am, they released the gate number we needed to go to. At .am they saw a big sign for the fast-track queue, so were were under the assumption they were doing fast passes first. “It got to .am and the board was saying the gate closed at am, Jack said. I thought they must be running behind.” At .am, with all queuers through the gate, the family made their way to the easyJet desk to get an update. “As we got there, the doors were closing,” Jack said. “The women at the desk said we’d missed our flight. “We were like, ‘Oh OK – how ’ It was all down to a complete lack of signage. There was no signpost for the normal queue. “One of the women said she’d radio through to try and get us on, but the departure people on the other end said no.” An employee at the desk then said a bus might be available to take the family to the plane, Jack claims. He said: “The woman radioed through again and I heard her say, ‘I already told them you said no, so it’s down to you.’  “It was so rude. If she’d said to the departure people that there was a five-year-old waiting to go to Disneyland, it could have been dferent. “We were really frustrated. If we’d got to the doors five seconds earlier, we would have made it.” Jack claims easyJet staff told him it had not done a last call on the tannoy because of a “silent airport” policy. He said an employee at the Bristol Airport information desk then told him there is no policy against last calls in the airport. Jack also alleges the information desk later told him the gate had shut at .am. He says the gate closure actually happened at .am. He added: “The guy on the desk offered us the .pm flight tickets for £ in total. When we didn’t accept that, he told us we could get it cheaper online. “He did not help in any way, shape or form, but I suppose he was the most helpful person there because at least he was giving us the truth.” Jack eventually booked the tickets online, costing a total of £, on top of the £ he paid for the initial tickets. He was frustrated at having lost a full day at Disneyland. “We’d woken up Oliver at am as a surprise. He hadn’t known we were going.

Ash Lammin, who was born a boy, began insisting that she was a girl as soon as she could speak, according to her mum. Terri, , said that watching her daughter - who was born Ashton - grow up confused and upset by her body was heartbreaking. She said: Although she was born male, from the moment she could speak Ash insisted she was a girl. By age five, she was asking aposwhen is someone going to chop my winky off apos - and questioning why she had it at all. Family photos from Ashaposs upbringing therefore mask a very dficult period for the family, who live near Ramsgate in Kent. In one, Ash is splashing around in a bath, wearing a sparkly mermaidaposs swimming costume and looking like an average three-year-old girl - obsessed with pink and wearing a princess dress, the sort of thing thataposs usually seen at birthday parties. But, Terri revealed, the only reason she was wearing her swimming costume in the bath was to hide her body - which had dismayed her from an early age. Ash says that it has been dficult growing up as a trans girl, but says she feels that she is firmly on the right path. She said: The journey is long and itaposs still going, but I feel like the sense of victory is there through it all. I do feel accepted sometimes, but other times not.  Not everyone is going to understand and people have to have their own opinions and I understand that. Some people might not like the idea of trans. I hope I inspire others but I just hope that love and acceptance comes through everything. According to her mum, Ash is the perfect example of a child who has been born in the wrong body. Now, aged almost , she is embarking on a y journey to transition her gender from male to female at an NHS-run clinic - and is one of the youngest in the country to do so. Ash - who changed her name by deed poll to Ashley when she was eight - will start by taking hormone blockers to halt the onset of puberty.  She has researched the process incessantly - and eventually wants a womb transplant so that she can be a mother when sheaposs older. While some critics have accused Terri of taking drastic decisions on behalf of a child who is too young to know better, she points out that Ash will take the blockers until she is . At that point, she herself will decide whether to go ahead with gender reassignment surgery. If she decides not to go ahead with it, Ash will come off the blocker - and her puberty will kick in just a few years later than her peers. Terri said: I never thought it was a phase, Ash was just Ash. When she was three she said to me, aposIaposm a boy because you gave me a boyaposs name - itaposs your fault.apos  I remember feeling horrible, because she blamed me. I personally thought maybe this was what an extremely camp gay man is like as a child. Iaposd never come across it before and I just went along with it. I just thought apos heaposs happy, well thataposs the main thing. But Terri, who has seven other children, said that le became much harder when Ash started at primary school. She said: I sent her to school in a boyaposs unorm. I felt awful, she didnapost want to wear it and I was making her. The school were great. The headmaster at the time said apos you think itaposs going to make le easier then bring Ash in a girlaposs unormapos, so I did. I was in a right state. I thought aposeverybody is going to think Iaposm weirdapos - but Ash loved it, she found it easy.  Before, when I was taking her into school, she was biting me and kicking me, she didnapost want to go in. As soon as she put the girlaposs unorm on, she wanted to go every day. Despite the schoolaposs willingness to help and the kindness of Ashaposs classmates, Terri says that other parents were very dficult - leaving her out of social events and complaining that Ash was using the girlsapos toilets. She added: When Ash was Ashton, she was invited to all the kidsapos parties, even though she used to turn up in a princess dress. The parents didnapost mind then. But as soon as I let her be Ashley all the time, for a whole year she didnapost get invited to one party. The kids were fine itaposs not the children, kids play with anybody. Itaposs not until an adult comes in and says you shouldnapost do that then it changes. When Ash turned  and went to secondary school, she became a target for bullies who would throw things at her on the bus and shout apostrannyapos at her - forcing Terri to take her out of the school after just one term.

A royal source said: “Jenner Meyer has been told to remove the images and in no uncertain terms how damaging this could be for Meghan and the Royal Family.” The designer boasted how she “can’t get enough” of Meghan wearing her jewellery. In the past year, she has been snapped at least  times wearing the designs.  Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said: “Meghan has again blurred the line between ­celebrity and royalty.” Jason Panudy, of PR experts Goldbug, said: “There can be little doubt Jenner Meyer’s brand will benefit.”Meyer, who was married to actor Tobey Maguire, became friends with the Duchess during her acting days.

Doctor Peter Cole, , has lost two stone since he began refusing to eat nearly a month ago and is only surviving on vitamins and water. He is one of three Extinction Rebellion activists on hunger strike outside the Conservative HQ building in Westminster, London, in a bid to get the political party to act on the climate crisis. The grandfather-of-two from Brighton said he plans to eat nothing until the election on Thursday, evenit means risking his health. He said: “I feel weak. For the first three days I was incredibly hungry but now I don’t feel it. I’m thinking, moving and speaking slowly. Everything takes a long time. “But I’m determined to continue until the election or the Conservatives talk to us.  “My family worry about me but Iaposm putting my le on the line for my grandchildren’s future. “They’re only two and four. I completely despair. I have a little hope - I wouldn’t be hereI didn’t, but I’m scared stf what they will be faced with. It’s a crisis.” Peter, who is a grandfather to Joseph, four, and Eleanor, two, called the Tory party “disgusting” for failing to meet with the climate protest group to explain their plans for the environment. He added: “The Tory Party really need to listen. “I have hope for political change - it can happen but they have a duty to the country and they’re not doing it. “I expected we would get a meeting before now.” The protest group have met with deputy leaders of Labour and the Liberal Democrats and had a one-hour meeting with the deputy leader and other senior members of the Green Party, but are still waiting to meet the party leaders. The Conservatives have not acknowledged the group.  Peter, who worked as a professor of respiratory medicine, said the soaring number of UK deaths from pollution levels have kept him coming to protest in the cold each day. Up to , people in the UK die as a result of air pollution every year. He said: “Air pollution is killing children. It’s maiming children who are growing up with lung damage that will affect them for the rest of their lives. “I’m worried for my grandchildren. They are the main thing I think about when I’m sat here.” The keen dancer said he would much rather spend his time dancing Argentine Tango than protest or working on research with other doctors but the climate crisis was “too important”. Peter and fellow hunger striker and grandfather Marko Stepanov, , yesterday sent a letter to Boris Johnson pressing him to act. It read: “We are both grandfathers who feel we have no option but to take this drastic action to highlight the gravity of the climate and ecological catastrophe that we are all facing.

It was discovered off the coast of a Greek island - and it had some unexpected cargo on board. The boat was being held down with jugs used to store wine and food, it has been claimed. The well-preserved containers, known as amphorae, were probably carrying olive oil and grains as well. The jars have been analysed by experts who determined when they were used by the Greeks and the Romans. The vessel is understood to measure m inand m in width. Researchers believe the ship to have been in operation between the first century BC and the first century AD. Dr George Ferentinos of the University of Patras is excited by the find. The wreck was found using sonar imaging to search the seabed around the island of Cephalonia, according to the Journal of Archaeological Science.

Two men were set upon by security guards in front of families queuing at enter Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park on Sunday night. One wearing a white coat was wrestled to the ground by three men in high vis jackets as he pleaded with them to “leave me alone”. At the same time the other man is led out of sight. One security guard pinned the victim’s arms to the ground as the other swung a hard fast kick to his exposed head.  Immediately after, another guard pinned his head to the floor with his elbow as the guard attempted to kick him again. Onlookers concerned for the victimaposs wellbeing attempt to intervene, with one man in the background shouting “hey security - don’t hit him”. The video ends with other staff members and security rushing to the maleaposs aid - after seemingly being alerted to the incident. A Winter Wonderland spokesperson confirmed a bouncer was sacked and another suspended following the incident. They told The Mirror: “We are aware of an incident that took place on Sunday evening, which saw members of the security team respond.  “Whilst handling this security issue, members of the security team acted inappropriately. A full investigation is underway and a security team member has been released from his post. Another has been suspended.” Met Police confirmed three people were arrested for public order offences, though it isn’t clearit was in connection with this fight. Katie Louise, , who travelled from Guildford to visit Winter Wonderland, said security guards dragged two males involved in and earlier incident behind a fence and began to beat them”.  She said: Fair enough there was a fight that should not have happened but to me what happened after, behind the scenes, was  times worse. Katie added that she could hear the victim on the ground saying he couldnapost breathe and said she saw one security guard putting a hand over his mouth to hold him down, MyLondon reports. After the footage was posted to social media, horried viewers slammed the behaviour of the guards. Keith Loscher tweeted: aposWhat animals! Four grown men around that lad, fair enough he needs to be restrained but kicking and punching him on the ground, terrible!apos Barry Cleugh wrote: aposIs it acceptable for anyone to be kicked in the head  Disgusting, regardless of what theyaposve done.  The incident occurred following a fight between two men throwing punches at each other. It is thought the fight broke out in a massive queue gathering outside the main beer hall of Winter Wonderland’s Baian village. The huge crowd formed outside the hall as it had been shut for an hour and was just re-opening.

The footage shows an area in Birminghamaposs Jewellery Quarter cordoned off with orange cones, while a man can be seen moving into the middle of the road. The clip was taken on a nearby shopaposs CCTV shortly before .am on Friday, December . Yesterday, the artist confirmed on Instagram the reindeer artwork that appeared on a railway bridge on Vyse Street was his work. The piece was reportedly vandalised just hours after the unveiling - with big red noses. A jewellery store owner who caught the footage of the dark figure on their camera said they were delighted that the artist had chosen to install his latest work in the Jewellery Quarter.The store owner said: Itaposs good. I have heard of him but didnapost know too much about him until now. The area has been a bit quiet recently. Because heaposs famous hopefully it will bring people to the area and theyaposll come in more. Itaposs great to have it on our doorstep and weaposre really pleased that Banksy came here. The artwork depicts a poignant message about homelessness this Christmas.  A video the fabled artist posted on his Instagram page tells an emotional story of a homeless man called Ryan. As Birmingham Live reports, Ryan has a drink in the footage and settles down on the bench by the wall. The camera pans outwards and show a pair reindeers appearing to spirit him away into the star-filled sky. It is believed Banksy disguised himself as a workman to complete the installation.  Martin Clarke, a jeweller at nearby Vault , said: I saw a small tent with a couple lads in high-vis vests early in the morning on Friday. I thought they were from the council and were just doing a bit of upkeep. About half six I looked out the window and the tent had gone as had the lads. Then I saw it. I thought it was great. We werenapost sure what it was at first or who did it but we had a good idea. A message on the artist’s Instagram said: God bless Birmingham.  In the  minutes we filmed Ryan on this bench passers-by gave him a hot drink, two chocolate bars and a lighter - without him ever asking for anything. #Banksy. Other business owners and Twitter users shared their joy. Phil Simpkin, manager of the Stone Room, said: Itaposs fantastic for the area and a big boost. Hopefully more people will come to the Jewellery Quarter to see the mural.  Stand Agency tweeted: “Drawing attention to homelessness this #Christmas in Birmingham in his trademark hard-hitting fashion. It’s also heart-warming to hear about the kindness and generosity of people walking past as this was being filmed. Another account said: God Bless #Birmingham #Banksy highlights #homelessness. However shortly after it was unveiled, the work was aposdefaced by a vandalapos who reportedly shouted out shall I tag it  and added red noses to the reindeer.  Darren Hawkins, from The Unseen Scene Magazine, told BirminghamLive how he was the last person to be pictured on the bench before it was spray painted. The incident happened at around pm as Darren said people aposbegged the man not to do itapos. He said: This guy was there with a tin of red spray paint in his hand. He kept asking saying aposshall I tag it apos People were saying aposno donapost do it.apos He then went up to the mural and sprayed both of the reindeer noses red to turn them into Rudolf. It was gutting to see him do it. He then ran off. He was quite a scruffy guy, aged between  and  and had a hood up. Police arrived shortly after. A woman from Jewellery Quarter Bid was trying to remove the sprayed graffiti. A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said they werenapost aware of the vandal attack but officers had been sent to the scene.

We saw it this week with the hack and leak of the NHS trade documents between the US and the UK, which look asthey were thrown online in a manner consistent with previous Russian “covert” info-ops. It was asthe perpetrators were begging to be identied. Or there’s yesterday’s news about Russian sports teams being done for doping in a fashion so crass it’s flabbergasting. As a result Russia is set to miss the  Tokyo Olympics and the  FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency.  WADA ruled Russia should be punished for manipulating laboratory data after the doping scandal. Then there is the “covert” control over separatist armies in Ukraine, which is obvious to anyone with the faintest knowledge of the situation or the outrageous denials of bombing civilians in Syria or the social media campaigns in the US where Russian trolls posed as Americans to help push the vote for Trump. The root of this behaviour is in the s, when the Kremlin’s leaders felt weaker than ever at home, let alone internationally. Kremlin spin doctors who worked on President Yeltsin’s and Putin’s victorious presidential campaigns told me their overarching aim was to resurrect the idea of the strong state, even though it had all but come apart. They figured they could make a weak Kremlin seem strong domestically by spreading the impression everywhere in the information flows and media landscapes of people’s lives. Thus they focused intently in taking control of television.  In more subtle ways, the Putin regime in the s made a big show of blatantly rigging the elections: the aim to convince people the government was so powerful it could pull off anything. The ultimate aim became, in the words of the spin doctor Gleb Pavlovsky, to convince people there was “no alternative to Putin”. In a recent book Pavlovsky argued Putin simulates global influence by purposefully leaving the fingerprints of his hackers and information operations all over the world. He said: “It’s all just theatre for a world audience.” As Trump and countless net trolls have worked out, gaining attention is power. And the easiest way to get attention is to be self-scandalising, whether you’re Nasty Nick in Big Brother or Putin in Ukraine.  Putin long ago proved to domestic audiences there is “no alternative” to him, but to do it on the world stage he needs to show the rules constraining his international behaviour mean nothing and the West’s strength is hollow. All the time he must ensure any push-back from Western countries will be mere sanctions and not the sort of strong military response where his weakness would become apparent. Thus the focus on operations that constantly push the West, or the thing once known as the West, into dilemma situations: large enough to generate attention, small enough to make sure the response remains non-military. So far he’s usually successful. Even his most violent actions, such as in Syria, came after a long period of testing the waters to ensure there would be no direct confrontation with a superior power. Now he can undertake a bombing operation that is low-risk for him but makes Russia look like a giant in the Middle East. At home the sanctions and verbal push-back from the “international community” help Putin argue that the West is all words and no real action.  Meanwhile he builds a siege mentality everyone had better go along with as, both domestically and internationally, there really does seem “no alternative to Putin”. The faltering upholders of the global order are in a double-bind: Not to respond to the Kremlin’s jabs looks weak responding plays into Putin’s promotion of the siege mentality. We see this in action with the WADA ban. It might be the right thing to do, but it’s being spun mercilessly inside Russia as what the Russian Prime Minister has called “anti-Russian hysteria”.

Whakatane, on the North Islandaposs east coast, is the main base for tours to White Island, about  kmoff the coast. Around  people were earlier evacuated from the island, many with burns. Tourists from Australia, the United States, Britain, China and Malaysia as well as New Zealanders were among the missing and injured, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has told media. New Zealand police said today the eight people still unaccounted for are likely dead. I would strongly suggest that there is no one that has survived on the island, New Zealand Deputy Commission John Tims told reporters in Wellington.  Victims of New Zealandaposs deadly volcanic eruption off White Island were covered in ash and appeared to have been badly burned, said a helicopter rescue pilot who flew them to hospital, as he recounted his experience on Tuesday. They were in a fairly serious condition, James Tayler, who flew some victims from Whakatane to hospitals in Auckland and Hamilton, said. They were pretty poorly ... but covered in ash, looking quite badly burned, said Tayler, adding that the ash had obscured the details of injuries.  Mr Tayler, who works with the Auckland Westpac Rescue Helicopter emergency service which joined the rescue effort, said: The biggest hazard was the signicant amount of dust still swirling in the air. The main concern wouldaposve been for any follow-up eruptions. Tourists caught in the deadly blast were there despite a recent increase in volcanic activity, although experts said precise predictions on eruptions were all but impossible.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay.

No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually. There is a lot of work going on, but I think we can do more.The next general elections hustings are set to take place on Monday.At .am, BBC Scotland will host a hustings at Heart of Hawick, while in the evening a second hustings, organised by Selkirk Community Council, will take place at Victoria Halls, Selkirk, at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"musical-instruments-ready-collect-peebles-high","story":"MUSICAL instruments left behind after last weeks fire are now ready to collect.All instruments have been collected from Peebles High School after the fire which has forced the High School to close until after Christmas.The instruments have been transported to Priorsford Primary School and will be available until pm today .Scottish Borders Council are making arrangements for further opportunities to collect belongings and instruments tomorrow , details of which will be released in due course.For all updates on the fire, visithttps:www.scotborders.gov.uk PHSfireHave you been impacted by the fire  Get in touch.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"The election no one wanted with the politicians no one trusts","story":"Channel  confirmed that the age of deference is truly over by refusing to accept the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Gove, as a stand in for Boris Johnson in their climate change debate. To the Conservative Partys dismay, the TV regulator, Ofcom, sided with the block of ice.Elsewhere on the dial, the BBC has been the target of unprecedented criticism for alleged bias in favour of the Conservatives. Two editing errors, one of which removed laughter from a clip of Boris Johnson in an earlier debate, became the justication for a social media tirade against the corporation. The clips have been watched and shared many times more than any of the TV debates.The BBCs political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has been widely portrayed, unfairly, as a Government spokeswoman. Contrariwise, Andrew Neil, who used to be attacked for having right-wing views, became an unlikely Twitter hero when his piece to camera condemning Boris Johnsons non-appearance on his show went viral. The block of ice, it seems, was otherwise engaged.Social media had been encroaching on the conventional press and media in the last two elections this time it came close to eclipsing them altogether. Analysis by Research Reality suggests that people are increasingly consuming political news through fragmented and partisan clips on their mobile phones, rather than from watching TV debates or reading articles. Politics has merged with entertainment. Comedians are now as influential as journalists or even politicians in shaping attitudes.Young people derive their political information almost exclusively from the internet, with its preoccupations about race and gender identity. Labour, with its media-savvy Momentum shock-troops, has dominated the new medium, churning out memes, jokes and provocative videos. If this were an election for the under-s, Jeremy Corbyn would already be measuring the curtains in Number . Hes called ldquothe absolute boy.Boris Johnson is portrayed as a Bullingdon blowhard, a racist, misogynist and, above all, a liar. Each speech and interview is tracked by a flotilla of ldquofact check posts of ying quality demonstrating that his pants are on fire. These are amplied by comedians and commentators condemning the Tories for being in the pockets of billionaires, letting children starve and for harbouring Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Eton-educated Leader of the House has been kept well away from microphones since his suggestion that people consumed in the Grenfell Tower blaze lacked common sense.Labour has had its own image problems, of course, not least the charge of anti-Semitism that simply wont go away. Last week an extraordinary dossier of allegations from  Labour current party staff, compiled for the forthcoming Equalities Commission investigation into anti-Semitism, was leaked at a crucial moment in Labourrsquos campaign. The leaders of all the major UK religious faiths had earlier condemned Jeremy Corbyn for failing to stamp out hatred towards Jews in Labour ranks. A succession of Labour candidates have been dumped for trading in anti-Semitic imagery and tropes.Mind you, a number of Tory and SNP candidates have also been dropped over anti-Semitism. One of the SNP casualties, Neale Hanvey, in the key target seat of Kirkcaldy, has not gone quietly. He enlisted the support of many in the Yes movement, including the outspoken nationalist blogger Wings Over Scotland, aka Stuart Campbell, who has urged supporters to vote for Hanvey on Thursday.Then, in a bizarre twist, the SNPs conduct investigator on the Hanvey case, Denise Findlay, also resigned. Someone revealed that she too had tweeted last year that: ldquoIt is not anti-Semitic to call Israel a Nazi state. Many of Campbellrsquos readers believe these candidates have been casualties of a growing factional ision in SNP ranks, mainly fought on social media, between transgender activists and members, like Hanvey and Findlay, who oppose self-ID.This winnowing of candidates would have been unimaginable in previous elections. It demonstrates again how social media has become a parallel battleground even at constituency level. Candidates social media accounts are ransacked for dodgy remarks. Twitter has taken on the character of a McCarthyite inquisition.The Big Issues, like taxation and spending, have taken a back seat. Labour evidently decided that it was no longer necessary in the social media age to be cautious about spending pledges. In for a penny in for a billion. The Labour manesto is bold and radical, and has been compared to the  Labour manesto of Clement Attlee. It also involves the biggest peacetime increase in Government spending.Labour is planning to spend and invest a grand total of pound billion over five years, to be financed, improbably, by a % tax on those earning over pound, . And this is only for its declared spending. The Labour manesto ldquoGrey Book did not include the cost of a four-day week, freezing the pension age or nationalising a raft of industries like energy and rail.It is easy to pick holes in the Labour programme, not least in the uncosted poundbn that Labour belatedly offered to the so-called Waspi women, who feel they lost out when the pension age for women was equalised with that of men. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was scathing about the Labour programme in general and that in particular.However, the influential IFS was scathing about all the parties programmes. It said the Tories promise of no increase in income tax, VAT or National Insurance is unsustainable. It also criticised the SNPs proposals, adding that independence would lead to greater austerity than under the Conservatives. This blanket condemnation of the respective parties numbers meant that the spending issue was largely neutralised as the campaign progressed. In the social media scrum, fiscal issues have hardly registered.Focus groups suggest that most voters do not believe Labours promises are credible, however. There has been an air of desperation about Corbyn offering free broadband, cheap rail tickets, lower rents, free childcare, free elderly care, cheaper fuel etc. Labour claimed this week that families will gain pound, a yearthey win the election. Its a shameless exercise in retail politics, but that doesnt mean it isnt effective.The Conservative manesto, by contrast, offers thin gruel. It does include increases in spending but only around poundbn a year, mainly on health, police and gigabit broadband. But the increases mostly restore the cuts made by the Tories in these areas since . The proposal for  new hospitals looks provisional at best and the promise of , nurses includes ,  already employed by the NHS.If you want free stuff, and are prepared to suspend disbelief, Labour certainly sounds attractive ndashyou live in England, that is. Most of the headline measures like free personal care, free tuition fees, free childcare and higher health spending, are already in place in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon said, with some justication, that Labours manesto was a ldquocut and paste job of the SNPs record in office.However, not even the SNP has proposed borrowing on the scale Labour envisage. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, wants to spend poundbn alone on retooling the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. Electrication of transport, planting two billion trees, investing in green industries. There has been a greater tolerance of government borrowing in this campaign, largely because the Conservatives have stopped using their old language of austerity: of ldquospending what we can afford.Both main parties are saying, in effect, that now is the time to invest because the cost of borrowing has signicantly reduced. Indeed, with near-zero interest rates, money is almost free right now. The UK deficit is only .% of GDP. However, the absolute debt pile is higher than ever.It has already increased from pound trillion to pound. trillion since the Conservatives came to office. This debt will eventually have to be repaid, andthere is an increase in interest rates ndash historically averaging % ndash then there could be a huge bill for millennials to pay. This on top of their present burden of tuition debt , high housing costs, insecure work and low pay.The generational ide has never been more apparent than in this general election. ldquoOK Boomer and ldquogammon have become widely-used terms of abuse on social media, directed at those born in the decades after the Second World War. The over-s are, of course, the generation that overwhelmingly voted for Brexit.This was supposed to be a Brexit election, but Europe has for much of the campaign been crowded out by other relatively trivial issues. In the final days it will no doubt , with the Tories repeating their mantra of ldquoget Brexit done beyond pain threshold. Jeremy Corbyn will be defending his much-criticised pretence that he has no view on the most important issue facing the country in  years.The Liberal Democrats, whove had a disastrous election, will be trying to remind us of their existence. Their leader, Jo Swinson, has been called a marmite politician ndashno-one liked marmite. Nicola Sturgeon still wants a referendum on independence next year and is expected to gain many seats.But this is a binary election for a non-binary age: between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. For good or ill, one of them alone will be entering Number  on Friday.

One-third of all UK greenhouse gas emissions comes from heating and yet itrsquos often overlooked.ldquoBut, in order to effectively tackle the climate crisis, finding ways to warm our homes and buildings with low carbon heat must be a priority.ldquoWhatrsquos so exciting about this report is that it not only offers a way to kick-start a society built on clean heat, it offers both economic and health benefits at the same time.

The five of them spend more hours online than there are in the day ndash the Mitchells clocked up a combined  digital hours per day. The first thing mum Ruth looks at in the morning is her phone.

We know tech is disruptive ndash it kills the high street, wipes out retailers, changes how we read newspapers or order a taxi ndash but the most disruptive aspect of technology is its effect on us. Wersquore losing the ability to relate to each other. Love is being disrupted. Technology is killing what makes us human.Like countless families, the Mitchells are ldquoalone together. They may sit in a room together, ghostly white light from their devices illuminating their faces, but no-one is talking. Itrsquos asthey donrsquot exist for each other. Theyrsquore isolated yet together. Itrsquos painful and sad to watch.The film-makers tell me they got the idea for the documentary when they learned that the average person touches their phone  times a day and that medical experts think giving a screen to a child is equivalent to a gram of cocaine in terms of the neurological effect on the brain.The Mitchells seem drugged by their devices. Dad Jason spent . hours a day online ndash as much as most of us sleep. Six-year-old Danielle was on a screen four and a half hours a day.Mum and dad have wasted years of their lives online which could have been spent with their children. The documentary uncovers how the couple have lost three years with eight-year-old Charlotte, two with Danielle, and one year with Alfie. Theyrsquove also wasted much of their own relationship. The Mitchells have been together ten years, but a third of that was spent on screens.In the film, the family agree to an intervention. Their devices are removed for five days. They blossom ndash they play games, talk, instead of a screen at bedtime the kids get playtime. Therersquos lots of closeness, hugs, kisses, eye contact. Before, they were like the living dead. Now, far from being bored, they feel alive.Within minutes of getting their devices back, though, the Mitchells are all staring blankly at screens. Ghosts to each other again.

At this time of year my inner child executes a daring Steve McQueen-style prison break to go on an eggnog fuelled rampage that doesnrsquot end until December the th.However, itrsquos my other child, the phone-loving dude who goes by the name of Ben, who Irsquom really hoping will enjoy this eveningrsquos entertainment. Although therersquos a sizable risk he wonrsquot be impressed at all. And not just because the night doesnrsquot involve any YouTube celebrities.Elfingrove has become a controversial topic on social media, with a number of mums and dads complaining that itrsquos overpriced and under-imagined. Of course social media doesnrsquot always provide the most balanced of forums. Take a reasonable comment, pluck it from its moorings and drop it in the Twittersphere and strange things start to happen. Like Dr Jekyll gulping down a pint of bubbling green potion, that same innocent statement will rapidly morph into something a lot less innocuous. It soon becomes a snarling, cackling, half-crazed, ldquoWit-you-lookin-at-pal  screech of unbridled rage.So perhaps social media manufactured the entire #elfingroveiseffinrubbish brouhaha.That doesnrsquot stop me feeling a tad trepidatious as Ben and I scurry through a west end thatrsquos being relentlessly rained upon by a mob of heckling storm clouds that are clearly on the side of Twitter and Facebook when it comes to the Elfingrove altercation.Benrsquos not making me feel any better. The daggers hersquos flashing me are the only thing illuminating the night sky. Until we reach Kelvingrove Museum, that is. Suddenly therersquos light everywhere. The entire faccedilade of the building has been turned into a modernist canvas, with spotlights painting wild patterns on the brickwork. Irsquom impressed, and sois Ben.Things improve even more when we reach the grounds of Kelvingrove, where a Christmas market has been rolled out. Readers of last weekrsquos Diary at Large may recall that I was disappointed with the Christmas market in Glasgow city centre. This onersquos smaller, though better, with more of a cosy Crimbo feel.Tents have been erected, similar to Native American teepees. Inside therersquos good cheer and drink. Opposite the teepees are food stalls and wood-burning fires for roasting marshmallows on sticks.Therersquos also a silent disco tent, which intrigues Ben, though wersquove no time to pause as wersquore racing up the steps into the museum. Awaiting us inside is an elf. Actually itrsquos an actor in an elf suitthough I donrsquot tell Ben this, not wanting to spoil the momentrsquos magic.ldquoOh look, itrsquos an actor in an elf suit, says Ben. Sometimes I forget hersquos . Almost a middle-aged bloke. Any moment now hersquoll be smoking a pipe, griping about the youth of today and voting to bring back hanging.Though hersquos not there yet, and I can tell that he is , ,starting to enjoy himself. Though obviously he doesnrsquot tell me that, as it would ruin his cool. The actor elf informs us shersquos in charge of elf and safety.She also gives us a card to guide us through the museum. It lists a number of elves wersquoll meet on the way, to be ticked-off on the card as we spot them.And so we head into the bowels of the museum. First up, therersquos a series of sculpted heads hanging from the cavernous ceiling in the main hall. Regular visitors to the museum will know this installation predates Elfingrove by quite a few years and was created by the artist Sophie Cave. However, for Elfingrove the heads have been brought to le. Almost. While spotlights flash upon them Queenrsquos Bohemian Rhapsody booms out, making it appear as though the heads are belting out the lyrics.Upstairs we come across more elves and more playful content. Therersquos an elf in charge of wrapping, although on this occasion thatrsquos been updated to mean rapping. Yrsquoknow, like P. Diddy and Emimem. This particular elf isnrsquot the best rapper Irsquove heard, though that doesnrsquot seem to bother the kids. Theyrsquore mostly primary school age, so probably arenrsquot well-versed in the traditional rapping lore of hook-ups, hold-ups and hustles. Though even a mature fellow like Ben is enjoying the performance.He also gets into the spirit of things in ious other rooms, dutully writing a letter to Santa which he slides down a chute.Then therersquos a Christmas Knight Out, with a pair of armoured knights battling in a corridor in a scrap to the death. Or at least until theyrsquore thoroughly knackered, which they seem to be already.Next up, we meet Rudolf. Though in this case hersquos not a reindeer but a roaring, robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex. We also come across a dancing fairy and some massive brussels sprouts hanging from a ceiling.An attempt has been made to enliven the spitfire that dangles from the museumrsquos western court. Flashing lights streak along the planersquos wings, and the roaring noise of engines create the illusion the planersquos in flight.Clearly a great deal of ambition, creativity and hard graft has gone into creating Elfingrove. So are the grumpy parents on social media being meanspirited  Not entirely.Some of the elf actors are a little bit awkward and amateurish, though Irsquom guessing the cream of the local acting talent are hamming it up in panto, this time of year.The major set pieces, such as the singing heads and flying spitfire, are impressive. Though not especially Christmas flavoured. Meanwhile the more intimate happenings lack a certain level of razzle-dazzle, and could almost have been cobbled together by a particularly energetic primary school teacher, well-versed in the wonders of glue, string, sticky-tape and papier-macirccheacute.Now Irsquom starting to sound like one of those Twitter tantrum types. So Irsquoll also add that the younger kids seemed to be having a ball. Plus a few of the older ones, too...ldquoTime to go home, I inform Ben, after wersquove roamed the museum for a couple of hours. ldquoBut I havenrsquot been in the silent disco yet! says Ben. ldquoAnd therersquos still a few rooms in the museum Irsquove got to seehellipHe shakes his head in disappointment as I guide him towards the exit gate.And so, because of me, the poor wee fellow only got to enjoy the singing heads, the flying spitfire, a mountain of marshmallows plus a few other quirky moments of minor magic.I told you I wasnrsquot much cop as a dad.

Aberdeenshire Council to ensure voters have a clear route as they head for the polls later this week.With the General Election taking place on Thursdaythe Roads, Landscape and Waste Service has been reviewing its winter service arrangements and preparing a contingency plan which can be implemented in the event of severe weather occurring in the days before or during polling day.The service has been working closely with the council’s election team in the preparation of the plan which includes scenario planning for dferent levels of severe weather events, how that might impact on access to polling stations and what resources would be required in order to respond to severe weather.At this time, no specic information has been issued by the Met Office suggesting particularly severe weather, with Wednesday forecast to be largely dry with some light snow on very high ground from noon on Thursday through to midnight. However, forecasts will be reviewed daily over the next few days as we approach polling day.The council’s Roads and Landscape Services manager Derek Murray said: “Should we be in a period of severe weather on the day of the election one of key tasks for the Roads, Landscape and Waste Service will be to ensure that the electorate can access all the polling stations on roads that are as safe as reasonably possible throughout polling day.“The service has placed additional resources on stand-by on December - to ensure that the maximum available staff, plant and equipment can respond where necessary.”The location of each polling station has been carefully considered and road and footway treatments routes in the vicinity have been adjusted to suit as necessary.Car parks at or near polling stations will also be treated where possible and bagged salt has been provided to every polling station for use around access doors and paths.The council’s list of farmers and contractors are also being contacted so that the council is in the best possible position to respond to severe weather.Meanwhile, normal operating hours for the council’s gritting crews between .am and pm may be extended to ensure polling stations can be accessed safely between am and pm and in order that ballot boxes can be safely delivered to the count in Aberdeen after the polls close.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"If you have fancied trying indoor rock climbing why not Gie it a Go \"  \"Gie it a Go\" this Christmas viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire msp backs small businesses","story":"Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin has backed the annual Small Business Saturday campaign.Small Business Saturday  takes place tomorrowand is designed to support, inspire and promote small businesses during the busiest shopping period of the year.The North-east MSP will visit local businesses promoting environmentally friendly trade including Bare at Ellon and Apothocary Coffee Shop.

That is why it is so important for our team to come together to celebrate our successes, learn from each other and connect as an organisation.“We’re incredibly proud to have supported over , people in the last year, more than half of which were new clients.

It’s a fantastic opportunity to thank everyone who helps make this possible and to motivate everyone to continue and surpass the excellent levels of support they provide across the region.“The number of cancers being diagnosed continues to rise, and every year it is estimated that over , people in Scotland are told they have cancer. However, more people than ever are living beyond a cancer diagnosis, which places even greater need for CLAN’s wellbeing, emotional and practical support services.”CLAN Cancer Support is an independent charity which provides comfort, support and information, free of charge, for anyone, of any age, affected by any type of cancer.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yet nothing is certain. Boris Johnson could still miss the goal spectacularly like Diana Ross famously missed that penalty at the ‘ World Cup opening ceremony.He undoubtedly has flair and talent, but can he be trusted to deliver  That has been the central issue that has limited his undoubted appeal and held him back from achieving an unassailable lead.At the outset of the campaign I argued that the election was Boris Johnson’s to lose. The danger facing him was that having benefitted from the public’s growing sense of grievance about Parliament obstructing the deliverance of Brexit he might be drawn into fighting on the ground of his opponents choosing where he could be more easily beaten. He might lose points on the NHS, he might be outflanked on social care or ridiculed for increasing police numbers that his party originally cut. Whatever the issue, Johnson had to remind the public that the general election had been called earlier than should be expected, and thatthey truly wanted to end their boredom and exhaustion with Brexit they must make a choice between giving him a majority – or sending him packing.In the end, from my own admittedly subjective viewpoint, Johnson has managed to hold on to a diminished lead because his main opponents have been unable to land any signicant blows. Indeed the very question of being able to trust Johnson that has been levelled at him by other leaders such as Corbyn, Sturgeon and Swinson has only raised the questions of trust in them.Labour’s revered Aunt Sally – the threat posed to the NHS by the dreaded Tories – becomes less convincing each time she is wheeled out in her bathchair. Thanks to the changing demographics a lot more demand is putting a strain on resources and with changing technology the costs rise further. NHS costs keep going up and this will not change whichever party governs the nation. Labour can argue you can’t trust the Tories on the NHS all it wants but it rings hollow when we know they say this every election and that every time they are in office they increase spending on the NHS – even during the period of austerity when other departments had their budgets cut.Nor do the attacks from Labour and the SNP about the threat of privatisation of NHS services have credibility.Their idea was to use President Trump as a bogey man but my MEP colleague Henrik Overgaard-Nin, a practising dentist and former head of the General Dental Practice Committee, utterly demolished this thesis last week by categorising how it has been the European Union forcing the growth of private provision of services in the NHS. Likewise it is the EU that was pushing a trade deal with President Obama that could have opened up the NHS further.In all of these points it is those such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson who by fighting to deliver Brexit are the real defenders of the NHS remaining accountable to the British electorate.In Scotland, the claims of Nicola Sturgeon are especially weak. The scandals of the tragic and avoidable deaths of children in Glasgow’s new infirmary due to contaminated water, and the unopened Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh costing an extra £ million that leaves her especially vulnerable to an accusation of rank hypocrisy. Claims about trust on law and order under Johnson – made after his promise to recruit , more police in England when it was the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats who originally reduced their numbers following the great recession – have no value when put by other parties who have their own records to feel ashamed about. This week in London the th murder was committed, surpassing last year’s total of  with three weeks of  still to go. The comparison of Johnson’s record as London mayor against the current Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, puts labour in the dock, not the Tories. Likewise the state of Scottish policing was brought into sharp focus by the resignation of Susan Deacon as the chair of the Scottish Police Authority claiming its governance and accountability is fundamentally flawed.While the issue of trust has undoubtedly undermined the Boris Johnson campaign it has not been a knockout blow, for sadly too many politicians come with the same reputational challenge about trust. Nicola Sturgeon promised the  independence referendum was “once in a generation” then “once in a letime” vote but started campaigning for a second referendum practically from the moment her campaign was defeated. At first she was careful enough to suggest it might take a few years but now, five years on and she has been pressing incessantly for a second vote – certainly not a generation later.Corbyn has his reputational problem with past associations with terrorist groups and now wishes to take our industrial relations back to the unrest of the seventies. Then there is labour’s ant-Semitism problem. Do people really trust Jeremy Corbyn The largest issue of trust for me is Johnson’s claim that only he can “get Brexit done”. It is proving a convincing slogan with the public fit to burst over the incessant parliamentary infighting and sharp practices to deliver a deal that suits the EU and leaves our country ided. I do not accept Boris’s “deal’ is anything other than an attempt to move the issue out of the public eye and play down the further capitulations of the UK’s interest that are yet to come. I fully expect the Prime Minister to get his majority and therefore get his deal through parliament – but I do not expect him to secure anything like the free trade deal with the EU that he claims is within his gt, nor do I expect him to go for leaving without a deal – so I foresee yet another extension to our membership after the end of .That’s why we need Brexit Party MPs to press Johnson to deliver, without them millions will have no voice.

These must be concluded more speedily than any similar deal in political history andthe shambolic UK negotiating team fails – by accident or by design – the inhabitants of Britain will face the same “no deal” clf edge next Christmas that was supposedly seen off in .This much we know. Every news bulletin and parliamentary debate will continue to be dominated by Brexit in . Uncertainty will blight investment, job security, le-plans, recruitment and the quality of public services. The unbelievable total of , nursing vacancies in the English NHS will not diminish but increase as EU workers finally depart for good. There will be no Golden Age for public services – why should there be when the new boss is actually the old boss  At a deeper level, how can Brexit ever “get done” when leaving is bitterly opposed by millions of voters who will neither abandon their commitment to European identity, nor be accommodated in any way by the new Prime Minister. Thus, Europe will only become more isive and totemic as an issue and will continue to distract from the seismic issues of inequality, climate crisis, and democratic modernisation the entire British political system has chosen to ignore. Most Tory voters and even Brexit supporters know this in their hearts.They back Boris, not to get Brexit done but because he’s the one who lets them dream a while longer, indulges make-believe, allows disorientated people to take respite from the bleakness and empty affluence his party has created with the vain hope of making Britain great again. No harsh realities, dficult choices or tough reappraisals from Santa Johnson. You only have to believe in his magical powers, his innate superiority and his bona fides. Or pretend. It’s like an electoral version of the Stockholm syndrome. Some depressing yet powerful human dynamics are at work.So, a Boris win is likely – but looking on the bright side, a Tory majority would change the thrust of political debate in early .Firstly, it would rob Boris Johnson of the chance to keep posing as the champion of The People against an evil, unresponsive, high-handed Remainer Parliament. If he becomes Prime Minister again, that “self-serving political elite” will largely be his own hand-picked “do or die” foot-soldiers. Any mistakes, delays, crassness or missed deadlines will be entirely and demonstrably his fault and no-one ’s. Alienated Tory big beasts like John Major will join with expelled grandees like Michael Heseltine to rub the new leader’s nose in it – and he must watch for signs of mutiny amongst hisloyal band of lieutenants Gove, Hancock, Javid and Raab – all of whom wanted to be leader themselves. At the first sign of trouble they could try to challenge Johnson, supported by Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May on the backbenches, nursing their wrath to keep it piping hot.Boris may be the darling of the Tory Party membership, but he will have very few friends in Parliament or , in the capital city. Is Johnson an accomplished political tightrope walker – we may soon find out.Secondly, an overall majority would probably also rob Boris of his best recruiting sergeant – Jeremy Corbyn. Not even Teflon Tony could have withstood the sustained and concerted hatchet-job Corbyn has faced every waking day for the last five weeks. The Labour leader has made the media’s job easier than it needed to be, but he’s also overseen a much-needed policy alignment. If Labour’s popular programme of renationalisation and public ownership is wedded to a new, more articulate and assertive leader – Boris will face real, spirited political opposition every inch of the way in . Thirdly, a Boris working majority would also end the absurdity of Arlene Foster and the DUP \u2028representing the views of Remain voting Northern Ireland. Greens and other small parties won’t stand against some Alliance and SDLP candidates, so there’s a chance Ms Foster’s personal authority will be seriously clipped – and that this could precipitate the much-predicted break-up of Britain.Astonishingly, it’s influential parts of the London media who’ve decided that’s on the cards.Channel Four anchor Jon Snow is travelling around the Celtic nations, making a series of films about dissatisfaction in the devolved nations. Radio Four’s flagship World this Weekend is planning an hour-long debate on the future of the United Kingdom for next week. Doubtless, more is planned.It’s ironic. The Conservatives have won elections in the teeth of fierce opposition from Scots for decades. But Brexit has finally thrown that crushing unfairness into sharp relief and a supportive media spotlight. So too have recent opinion polls which suggest a majority of Scots would support independenceBoris Johnson triggers withdrawal from the EU. London’s sudden interest in Scotland’s constitutional bind is welcome, but dangerous too. Enthusiasm may soon waneScots don’t live up to our newfound billing as the Remain rebels who Won’t Stand For Brexit. Unfairly, since no smaller member of this “family of nations” has yet found a way to exercise authority or be heard. But the British media doesn’t do fair, patient, marginal or incremental. So, the pressure will not relent. Brexit won’t get doneBoris wins the vote. And an SNP-supported Corbyn government is still a much better bet.

I am a new Tory. And until I joined the party, I had never voted Tory, I was for the most part a Labour voter.

And nothing on Islamophobia within the Conservative Party.Admittedly the splash headline “Corbyn has made Labour a welcoming refuge for anti-Semites” was legitimate. It was taken from the Jewish Labour Movement’s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commissioninquiry. And what a damning submission it was.It said the party to which its members belonged “promotes anti-Semites to positions of power does not take actionagainst those guilty of abhorrent anti-Semitism victimises those who speak out against anti-Semitism fails to protect Jewish members from anti-Semitism allows Jewish MPs to be hounded out of their political home and derides the issue of anti-Semitism to the extent that its very existence within the party is denied.” Such criticism was not unexpected. In the past decade Corbyn has been involved in a succession of incidents – from his defence of an anti-Semitic mural in Tower Hamlets to the glowing foreword he wrote to a book laden with anti-Semitic tropes – which appeared to validate suggestions he was fostering a culture of racism. To understand the impact this has had on Jewish members one need only look as far as East Renfrewshire – home to the largest Jewish community in Scotland. For more than  years this constituency ed Jim Murphy, Blairite and one-time member of the Labour Friends of Israel group, as its MP. Last week, the current Labour candidate Carolann Davidson told a Glasgow Jewish Representative Councilhustings the Labour Party did not deserve their vote. She said she’d only come to reassure them some Labour politicians refused to surrender to racism.With Jewish MPs including Luciana Berger forced out, you would have to be a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist to believe Corbyn was being ly smeared . You might wonderfive full pages on the EHRC investigation and no pages on – for example – the poverty that is blighting the lives of hundreds of thousands of children at Christmas – was politically motivated. And you might go on to surmise that, while all racism is equally bad, some forms of racism are less equally bad than others.While Corbyn is suffering as a result of his failure to address anti-Semitism, Boris Johnson is shrugging off quite blatant Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, such as Sally-Ann Hart’s claim that learning disabled people should earn less because “they don’t understand money.”We know Johnson is racist, because racist sentiments so often pop out of his racist mouth. He has talked about “piccaninnies with water melon smiles” and compared Muslim women to letter boxes. In , he described Islamophobia as the natural reaction to Islam, while in  he suggested Malaysian women coming to UK universities were looking for a man to marry.Like Corbyn, he has promised to root out the problem while continuing to support those who embody it. He promoted Zac Goldsmith to his cabinet despite Goldsmith’s Islamophobic London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan, and he continues to employ Tommy Robinson’s pal Chloe Westley as an aide.You can detect the same notes of betrayal in the voices of Berger and Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi, who described the past four years as like being in an abusive relationship. She spoke after discovering a promised internal investigation into Islamophobia was to be watered down to “an investigation into prejudice of all kinds”.The incidents of Islamophobia go all the way down into the grassroots of the party. Earlier this year, the Conservatives suspended  party members for a string of abusive social media posts, including one that called for all Muslims to be turfed out of public office.Then, last month,  sitting and former Tory councillors were suspended in another social media scandal in which one poster referred to Muslims as “the enemy within”.The party insists such suspensions are evidence of a zero tolerance approach. What, then, are we to make of ministers Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom and Thérèse Coffey, who have been out on the campaign trail supporting candidates facing claims of Islamophobia  Meanwhile Channel ’s misquoting of Johnson – it claimed he uttered he words: “people of colour” when, in fact, he said “people of talent” – is \u2028being touted as evidence he is not prejudiced. In fact it is merely evidence that, now and again, he remembers not to gt-wrap racist ideology in racist rhetoric.This “talent” quote is a sanitised expression of an immigration policy that created a hostile environment for asylum seekers and deported British citizens back to the West Indies. Let’s not get too outraged with C for mishearing something that, to most people, seemed entirely plausible. And, while criticising Corbyn for failing to apologise for anti-Semitism during his Andrew Neil interview, let’s not forget Johnson wouldn’t submit to the Neil interrogation. And that his response to questions about Islamophobia in the latest leaders’ debate was to change the subject back to Brexit.All this measuring of Labour and Tory sins should not be reduced to whataboutery. But it very often is. The way in which the partiesturn examples of their rivals’ racism into anti-ballistic missile systems capable of combating their own is demoralising This election should not be a game of bigotry Top Trumps. The Conservative Party’s racism does nothing to dilute the Labour Party’s nor ought there to be some hierarchy of hatred. Still, it is worth asking why there is so much focus on one type of racism, while another is seen as more trivial. And why – when the concept of anti-Semitism is rightly sacrosanct – the Spectator and other right-wing publications feel free to carry columns suggesting Islamophobia is a fiction created to silence criticism of fundamentalism  The consequences of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are almost identical: fear, hurt, and radicalisation within affected communities, and a rise in hate crime towards them. Othering is othering is othering. Whether you are a Hasidic Jew visiting the synagogue in Gfnock or a bearded Muslim attending a mosque in Pollokshields, the misery of being insulted, spat at or attacked is the same. It is to be hoped the EHRC launches an investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party as it has into anti-Semitism in Labour to reinforce that any form of racial discrimination is unacceptable and must be rooted out. And that – instead of posturing and preicating and pointing to each others’ flaws – all the parties will come to a consensus on the iniquity of religious ethnic hatred: for the sake of social cohesion and so their own exiled members canto the fold.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a1 motorway in east lothian closed as lorries blown over in high winds","story":"The road has been shut off between Torness and Innerwick junctions in both directions while emergency services deal with the incident and ersions are set up.window.twttr : Major disruption on Scotlands roads as wind and heavy rain blasts countryIn a statement, Road Policing Scotland said: \"Emergency service personnel are working under challenging circumstances due to the high winds.

Also, the suggestion that the true purpose of art is to wind up the middle classes is blinkered nonsense.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/001WH2911NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 29th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people.

While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult.

Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster admits to mistakes in leadership that has seen some dark moments","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Asked on BBC Radio s Today programme about the sense of some in the unionist community that Mr Johnsons deal was a \"betrayal\", she said: \"I think it is right for the leadership of unionism in Northern Ireland to try to work with the Prime Minister of the day to get the best deal for Northern Ireland. \"We will always do that. We will continue to do that. I think it says more about the person who broke their word than me and the leadership of the ... Democratic Unionist Party.\" But Mr Aiken said Mrs Foster needed to win back voters trust. He said: \"Her statement begs the question, how can anyone take Arlene Foster at her word again  On December , , Arlene Foster stated that the DUP would not accept any form of regulatory ergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the United Kingdom. \"Yet on October , , Arlene Foster warmly welcomed Boris Johnsons proposals for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea by describing them as a serious and sensible way forward.\"Arlene Foster may not have been across every jot and tittle of detail in the past, but the least the Northern Ireland electorate can expect is an explanation of the reason for the DUP U-turn on such a fundamental principle of a regulatory border in the Irish Sea rather than denials which dont bear scrutiny.\"DUP Lagan Valley candidate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Mr Aikens attack was \"out of step with the vast majority of unionists\". \"I want to see unionists working together in opposition to the Prime Ministers deal. Indeed, it was the DUPs  votes which blocked that bad deal being forced on us,\" he said.\"Only a strong team of DUP MPs will have the influence in a hung Parliament. Votes from Northern Ireland MPs could once again be crucial in Parliament following this election.\"Speaking on Radio , Mrs Foster said the DUP had been told by tax officials before the PM announced his deal that there would be checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. She said a lack of free-flowing trade would cause \"economic instability in Northern Ireland\". Her comments came after a leaked Treasury report last week concluded customs checks and possibly even tarfs could be required on goods travelling in both directions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. But Mr Johnson said over the weekend that the report was \"wrong\" and repeated his claim that NI would have \"unfettered access\" to the UK market. Yesterday, Tanaiste Simon Covney said it was \"clear\" that the new deal includes checks.\"The EU has made it clear they want to minimise the impact on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but at the same time goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will need to have some checks to ensure that the EU knows what is potentially coming into their market through Northern Ireland.\"He said goods going from NI to Great Britain \"will probably be limited to an export declaration\"."},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile a tough tussle looms in south antrim as three parties believe they can win it","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Read MoreConstituency Profile: DUPs Shannon all but certain to see off Alliance in StrangfordAds for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.Paul MaskeyThe mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Frank McCoubreyMr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Gerry CarrollMr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Its by no means purely an SDLP team. Two Green Party activists and two former Womens Coalition members are there.The candidate needs to secure support from outside her partys usual voting base, and the evidence from the doors is that shes doing that.\"I normally vote Alliance, but youll get my preference this time because I think youre the person to oust our current Westminster representative\" a man tells her.\"If you lend me your vote, Ill look after it,\" Hanna pledges.A Co Armagh teacher says: \"I usually vote People Before Profit, but Im with you in this election.

Many know her from the school gates or parks. Others have seen her whizzing about the area on her bike.One woman asks who will succeed her as South Belfast MLAshes elected to Westminster. \"There will be an internal party contest. Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.MichaelThe compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw talks to a constituent as she canvasses in Newtownbreda\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.Paula Bradshaw\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable.

In this election, we have an opportunity to send voices and votes to Westminster that can stand up for us and stand against the DUP. \"In this election we simply cant afford the luxury of voicing a strong protest.

When Sylvia Hermon spoke, she spoke for all of us. None of us viewed her through the silos of the traditional ide in Northern Ireland - she was our remain voice and she will be badly missed.\"Mr Eastwood said the election \"is a chance to maximise the Remain representation across Northern Ireland\". \"That is what motivated the SDLP to take a lead in making that ambition a reality and removing as many damaging DUP votes as possible,\" he said.\"That was a choice not about pacts but about protection - protecting us from Boris Johnson and protecting us from Brexit.\"The choice made by the SDLP was to be strategic, not selfish.\"Mr Eastwood dismissed suggestions from Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald that nothing could be gained by sitting in the Commons.He added: \"History doesnt judge those who dont turn up at defining moments - it casts a far harsher verdict. It simply doesnt mention them because they make no dference. You only make a dference by being there.\"He pointed to a number of issues - including fair employment legislation, creation of the PSNI, and pension rights for factory workers - all secured, he said, by his party being present on the green benches.He added: \"Ask anybody who can countthere is going to be a dference made by MPs sitting in Westminster. \"This thing could be decided on the basis of a couple of votes.

They have refused to provide the Nolan Show with an intervieweePosted by Stephen Nolan on Monday, December , He highlighted how the DUP had been dragging its feet over committing to an interview ahead of Thursdays General Election. He said party officials only said they were \"looking at it\".\"And here we are, no DUP,\" he told his legion of listeners saying it was through the licence fee he was able to hold politicians to account so they could justy their actions.\"Thats why this is important,\" he said.\"Usually political parties fight for an opportunity to be on the BBC to sell their manestos.\"Every single party who were asked to have their manesto scrutinised by the Nolan show, have agreed a date, except one.\"We think it is important to scrutinise their manesto whether they are here or not.\"He said he \"deeply regretted\" the party would not appear on his show to answer his questions.On Facebook the show broadcast live an image of an empty chair with the DUP manesto sitting on it.Arlene FosterIn recent weeks broadcasters have taken the decision to empty chair politicians over their refusal to appear on shows during election campaigning. Sky News presenter Kay Burleys interrogation of an empty chair pulled in more viewers than any interview the absent Conservative chairman James Cleverly would have achieved had he appeared.And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism for his refusal to be interviewed by the BBCs Andrew Neil.In all, Stephen Nolan dedicated an entire hour to the DUP manesto with contributions from BBC political and business editors and callers to the programme.He said the DUP could have reached out to his over , listeners but \"theyve chosen not to do that\".\"There are so many questions I have for the DUP on your behalf and do you know what  I am going to ask them.\"He askedthe party was \"embarrassed\" about how Prime Minister Boris Johnson had treated them,its pursuit of Brexit had damaged the Union and why they were not ruling out working with the Conservative leader in the future given his treatment of the party which lauded him as a \"friend of unionism\".Pointing to recent polling which suggests the majority of unionists are now pro-remain he said he would have asked the party on it.Read MoreWho were the winners and losers  Suzanne Breens verdict on UTV election debateDUP accuses Boris Johnson of breaking his word on union commitmentThe presenter spoke for almost  minutes on what he wanted to ask the party, breaking up his monologue with prolonged silences.He asked about social issues such as health and how the party could convince the next generation of unionism why it was \"best in class\" on those matters beyond the traditional green and orange stances taken.On the money secured by the party for health Mr Nolan said he wanted to ask how how it prioritised the matter andit was further down the order than \"preventing an Irish language act\" in reference to the ongoing political impasse which has seen Northern Ireland go without local government for almost three years.Mr Nolan said it would have been interesting to hear the partys thoughts on that political deadlock and - given the ongoing healthcare workers industrial action - its thoughts on the millions spent on MLA salaries.He also askedthe party regretted breaking pay parity between Northern Ireland and GB health staff which helped bring about the current industrial action crippling healthcare.Stephen NolanOn the partys outreach to \"as wide a base as possible\" he askedthat included gay people andthe DUP was prepared to apologise for comments made by some of its members in the past on homosexuality andsimilar comments could be made again.\"Because politicians are being held to account in this election, they are answering questions about their past words,\" he continued.\"You say in your manesto you want to protect animals better - might you be minded to protect gay people better - and should they vote for you this time around \"Callers to the show congratulated Mr Nolan on proceeding with his show in the absence of the party.He confirmed Sinn Fein would be appearing on his show on Tuesday morning.\"The details of any manesto is important - every other political party has consented to me scrutinising the detail within their promises - except the DUP,\" said Mr Nolan.Sammy WilsonThe DUP has denied holding a boycott over the show although Sammy Wilson admitted it came to a \"collective decision\" to not appear on the show \"as the best way of hurting him\".\"I would just say to the DUP,there is no Nolan show boycott, why are you not here \" asked Mr Nolan.\"If it is even possible for people to think you cant face up to me - how have you got what it takes to face down Boris Johnson or Mary Lou McDonald when your voters need you to \"He added: \"There are loads of articulate, seasoned politicians who could have come in this morning that could have answered these questions - possibly quite well, possibly attracting you to vote for them - instead my questions on your behalf are met with silence.\"I hope I have been able to bring you some of the questions I would have asked the DUP and I deeply regret that I could not convince them to answer them.\"The DUP did not respond to a request for comment.A BBC spokeswoman added: \"In the run up to the election, the Nolan show has been examining manestos and bringing listeners its trademark political interviews with representatives from the main political parties. The DUP was invited on to the programme but did not provide a representative. Stephen will continue to scrutinise manestos and drill down into the issues that matter to the public, as his listeners expect, in the run up to polling day on Thursday.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38765173.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/E%20081219KB1%20%200013.jpg","title":"who were the winners and losers suzanne breens verdict on utv election debate","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His media performances have been first-class, and this was no exception.Two SDLP advisers accompanied him to the debate, but he didn’t need them. From start to finish he was passionate, polished and professional. He was streets ahead of Michelle O’Neill. While he scored countless points against her, it wasn’t in a destructive way.His most successful moments were when he challenged Sinn Fein on abstentionism from a pragmatic, not ideological, position.He blew away the argument that going to Westminster made no practical dference.Whether we liked it or not, massive decisions were taken there, and MPs had already stopped Brexit several times. “We need to be there fighting against Boris Johnson, locking him out of Downing Street,” Eastwood said.He brushed off claims that this stance was at odds with pulling out of North Belfast for an abstentionist Sinn Fein candidate.“I’d much rather have John Finucane sitting in his house than Nigel Dodds sitting in the House of Commons,” he replied.There was a stinging one-liner to the DUP about how “no amount of Ulster Hall meetings or banging drums” would change things on Brexit. Eastwood’s words will have secured him no friends among unionists. But his eyes are focused on Foyle, and he may well have won over soft Sinn Fein voters with this sparky performance.Emma Little-Pengelly, DUPEmma Little-Pengelly DUP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.The word was that Nigel Dodds would stand in for Arlene Foster in this debate but the DUP opted for Emma Little-Pengelly as a substitute.She is fighting to retain her Westminster seat from the SDLP so prime-time media exposure helps. The outgoing South Belfast MP performed well given that she has considerably less experience than her rivals in such scenarios.Her opening statement was excellent. Her brief was obviously to mention the DUP’s £.bn confidence-and-supply money for Northern Ireland as often as possible. The repetition does get a little tedious. Naomi Long at one stage said the money was “a drop in the ocean” of what was needed to turn around public services here.Little-Pengelly didn’t have answers for some of the criticism her rivals made. On a Brexit plan, the best the DUP can come up with is that a hung Parliament is likely and it will exert its influence againholding the balance of power.Little-Pengelly did handle Steve Aiken’s assertive approach expertly. Her barrister training clearly helps.She came across as moderate and measured, and that will do her no harm in South Belfast.She held up her party’s manesto twice near the end of the debate. That is aimed not at the DUP’s core voters but at the middle-class unionist constituency whom the party wants to win over with its policy detail.Naomi Long, AllianceNaomi Long Alliance at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Naomi Long started nervously, and that is not like her. She and Steve Aiken were the only leaders to look at their notes during their opening statements.But from there on the Alliance leader was in top form. She tackled both the DUP and Sinn Fein very successfully several times.There were some stinging one-liners. Long insisted it wasn’t a choice between dealing with health and an Irish Language Act — “we can walk and chew gum at the same time”.In the health discussion, she raised Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and Little-Pengelly’s husband, which clearly is uncomfortable territory for the DUP.Less successful was Long’s metaphor about Brexit unicorns and donkeys. She has used it too many times and it has lost its appeal.The Alliance leader was totally honest about our NHS crisis, admitting there isn’t “a silver bullet or magic wand”.She was taking no prisoners regarding the DUP and Sinn Fein’s record of government at Stormont. Alliance, the SDLP and UUP sat around the Executive table while the two big parties sat in another room and carved things out between them, she said.Long came across as that rare breed — a straight-talking politician with integrity. This performance strengthens her image as someone who wants to get things done here but is frustrated by the obstinacy of others.Michelle O’Neill, Sinn FeinMichelle ONeill Sinn Fein at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.This was a typical Michelle O’Neill performance. She didn’t drop the ball, but neither did she run with it and score.Sinn Fein prefers script over spontaneity, and its vice-president stuck to that approach. Tory austerity was a get out-of-jail card whenever her party’s own record was raised.Her best line came when accusing DUP politicians of initial over-excitement about their influence at Westminster. “They’re now sobering up to the reality thatyou’re bought, you can be sold,” she said. The image of a drunk DUP will have raised smiles in a fair few homes. O’Neill’s weakest moment came when she was asked why there was only a single line in Sinn Fein’s manesto about health. “This election is all about Brexit,” she said.Neither had O’Neill answers as to why as Health Minister she didn’t reverse the DUP’s decision to end pay parity for health service workers here. In her favour, she came across as pleasant, and someone who can definitely do business with unionists. She is no bogeywoman..jpg\" title\"Sinn Fein Deputy leader Michelle ONeilland DUP South Belfast Candidate Emma Little-Pengelly during the recording of UTV election debate at the Queens Film studio in Belfast.

Indeed, with so much gusto that he faced allegations of aggression from Emma Little-Pengelly.There was an awkward moment during the Brexit segment when the DUP candidate tried to cut across the UUP leader. “Wait!,” he said firmly, and put up his hand. A male politician saying that to a female one just doesn’t look good, whatever the intention. It wasn’t helped by Aiken then saying to her: “Don’t tell me I’m wrong!”The UUP is taking an assertive approach towards its DUP rival in this election and that is tactically no bad thing. But the tone of this particular exchange was perhaps not the wisest. The substance of what Aiken said, unlike the delivery, was actually very good.The point that a border down the Irish Sea appeared on the DUP’s watch and “Arlene Foster, Nigel Dodds, Sammy Wilson and you Emma” bear responsibility will hurt the DUP. Although it may not lose that party support, as grassroots unionists seem to blame Boris Johnson alone for the Brexit betrayal. Aiken called for a health emergency to be declared here by London rather than waiting for theof devolution.He pointed out that when the UUP held Stormont’s Health Ministry there were , on our waiting list compared to , now. But his whole performance, unfortunately, just didn’t hang together."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland among worstperforming european countries for climate action report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Climate Change Performance Index, launched on Tuesday at the UN Climate Conferencein Madrid, shows that although Ireland has slightly improved its position since last year, it still ranks among some of the worst-performing countries in Europe.Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network publish the Index annually.In this year’s index, using data from , Ireland ranked st out of  countries worldwide, moving up from the group of “very low” to “low” performers.In greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland ranked third from bottom for EU countries.The Government must go much further in implementing policies across all sectors that drive sustained emissions reductions over the next decade Climate Change Performance Index reportThe ranking is an improvement on last year, moving up by seven places, after Ireland was ranked the worst EU performer.The report reads: “Ireland’s GHGper capita emissions remain at a relatively high level, and signicant challenges lie ahead in closing Ireland’s emissions gap, meeting the target and aligning Ireland’s emissions trajectory with a net zero goal for .“Therefore, the country still ranks among the bottom ten performers in this indicator.”The report also criticises “the signicant lack of progress in decarbonising key parts of the economy, mainly in agriculture, road transport and the residential sector”.It said: “The Government must go much further in implementing policies across all sectors that drive sustained emissions reductions over the next decade.”On a positive note for the Government, the index report welcomed Ireland’s new proposals set out in the  Climate Action Plan, including putting the  target into law and introducing legally binding five-year carbon budgets.Campaigners have long criticised Environment Minister Richard Bruton’s policies on the climate emergency, which they say do not go far enough to tackle the issues.Catherine Devitt, head of policy at the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition, said: “Ireland’s polluting emissions remain on an upward trend, the Government has yet to join other member states in calling for the EU to urgently raise its ambition in line with the Paris Agreement, and the scale of % emissions cuts per year presented in the Government’s action plan is wholly inadequate.If the Government is serious about wanting to improve its reputation on climate change and to do its fair share of the global effort, there needs to be a frontloading of concrete action across all sectors to ensure the scale of reductions needed can be deliveredCatherine Devitt, Stop Climate Chaos Coalition“The science and the mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that we need far-reaching transformation across all aspects of society.“If the Government is serious about wanting to improve its reputation on climate change and to do its fair share of the global effort, there needs to be a frontloading of concrete action across all sectors to ensure the scale of reductions needed can be delivered.”The publication of the CCPI report comes as Mr Bruton is expected to participate in the high level segment on December  and  at COP, where heads of state and government will make national statements on increasing their targets.A spokesperson for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment said the report does not take into account its new policy arrangements for climate, adding: “This report, prepared by a German climate NGO, based on  data and interviews from other NGOs, highlights the urgency of the work the Government are doing with the Climate Action Plan.“The Climate Action Plan, launched earlier this year, will ensure Ireland will reach our  targets and will put us on the right trajectory to meet net zero emissions by .“The plan have actions across all sectors of society and will have timelines with clear lines of responsibility.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein brings rent freeze measure to the dail","story":" Hi

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Indeed, it is fair to say that our group have been strong supporters of the initiative long before many of the current UU administration ever heard of it. Unfortunately, our city-region has so focused its attentions on this new school – which,UU ever gets its necessary permissions and finance, will have  students by  – that we have completely lost sight of the much bigger picture. Higher Education provision North West is at a catastrophically low level, it has been this way for  years, and our failure to address this crisis is resulting in lasting generational damage. googletag.cmd.push Moreover, the minimal university provision that is located here is controlled and taxed by Belfast and of no economic benefit to our region. Things have gotten so bad that our own Council was recently caught inflating student numbers on a trade mission in a bid to put a gloss on a very bad picture. UU, meanwhile, have spent the past decade playing a bizarre game of push-halfpenny, moving courses in and out of Magee in rapid succession in a bid to create the faccedilade of expansion. But the figures published by the Derry News last month show their manoeuvring to be nothing but a cynical exercise – we had fewer than  full-time university students in  and we still have fewer than  today. googletag.cmd.push And forget any meaningful UU expansion over the next  years. After spending, and borrowing, poundm-plus for the new white elephant campus in North Belfast, there is no money left for Derry. Not a doily. UU will predictably move a few le sciences courses here from Coleraine, for the short-term, to support their case for the medical school. Expect an announcement on this in the New Year to take the heat off the fact that the medical school is in limbo. But what they won’t mention is that within the last few years they emptied the campus of Psychology and Sociology courses – to the tune of  students. Now they’ve discovered they need numbers back in Derry. But what will be the next to go when our backs are turned  God knows, the priority is to fill Belfast at all costs. They even had the temerity to remove INCORE, an institution developed and rooted in the North West. So don’t ever think anything is sacred – and particularly not the new medical school.   A three-line business case As campaigners we are often challenged by well-meaning supporters and patronising critics to put our money where our mouth is and produce a business case for a new university. And in our previous incarnation we did that, wasting tens of thousands of pounds, and several years, preparing a meticulousproposal that politicians, civil servants and UU blithely ignored in favour of a series of empty promises from each other. Let’s not mince words, the business case is blindingly obvious – and anyone asking for it is really just asking to stall. It can be delivered in just three lines: a The North West has some of the worst social indices on these islands as regards health, education and employment, and our need for HE provision has been established since . b A standalone university of , students, delivering accredited courses from the National University of Ireland’s ten facultiesbefore research earnings are taken into account. On top of this, each student will then spend somewhere between pound and pound to the North West economy per year, bringing in additional annual revenue of between poundm and poundm to the region. c If we don’t move immediately on a standalone university, orwe sit back and expect delivery from UU, Stormont and the NI Civil Service – all of which have failed us and bled our city-region dry for decades – we will inflict decades more of poverty and emigration on the generations to come. We can’t NOT do this. The dficulty is not and has never been, the business case. The dficulty is political will and fear thatwe ‘rock the boat’ we will get nothing. It shows the poverty of ambition in the North West that the election debate in Foyle has been dominated by discussion over who will get credit for a -seat faculty we were first promised almost two decades ago. Every single one of our representatives, political or civil, is too frightened to speak out and demand the wholesale changes we need in case they get blamed for delaying the medical school. It is nothing less than Stockholm Syndrome. It is aswe have talked so long without response about how shockingly discriminatory the situation is, and has always been, that we doubt our own case. Despite that, there is huge support from outside the region from those who can see clearly that the North West’s claim to have its own university is unassailable. Local government in the North West, in partnership with civic society, must take responsibility for the development and scrutiny of all existing and future university development. We cannot allow others, whose interests are not those of the North West, to take the lead. It is reckless of us not to look where for university partners. We are putting the futures of our children at risk. We have American partners, Irish partners and British partners who are interested now in helping us develop a standalone institution. It is time to pull them together and build. We have been led by the nose for too long. Our new MP to be elected this week has a big job ahead of her him. If Derry is to undergo the revival it needs, s he must start by demonstrating the political will to deliver us the new university we deserve. Next week talks will begin to re-establish Stormont. Again, our agenda should be blindingly obvious here. Except, this time, it can be summed up in one line:you want us to have faith in the Belfast institutions, build us a standalone, regional university that puts an end to a century of discrimination respects and reflects our Irish, British and European identity and marks the beginning of a new equal society in northwest Ireland.

So instead of saying ‘no, no no!”, ‘don’t touch’ or spending hours re-doing them every night, why not give your child a Christmas box  Simply fill a shoe box or a large cloth bag,with the decorations you don’t want any more, decorations donated from a friend or cheap ones bought from a bargain shop. Just make sure they aren’t dangerous, can’t be choked upon etc and let your little one feel the textures, enjoy the sparkly colours, see and touch the glittery baubles, the soft Father Christmas or sparkly beads, maybe you could even buy a little cheap tree for them to decorate! Add to your Christmas box wrapping paper, bows and ribbon to feel and crinkle and of course to wrap ‘presents up’ too , and of course Christmas cards to write on!Salt dough, to make snowman ornaments or baby hand prints to sprinkle with glitter and nish, just remember to add a hole before you bake them so they can hang on your tree. .Shake  Snow, wash an old jar and it’s lid and allow to dry. Stick a Christmas ornament to the lid , pour glitter, sequins or pretend snowinto the jar. Fill about   way with water, add approximately two tablespoons of glycerin and stir. Put on the lid and shake - fabulous! .Christmas cards, who doesn’t like a home made card! Here are a few suggestions For baby - paint their feet, print onto card and write mistletoes! For toddlers - paint their hand white and print onto cardstick on a Christmas hat, add two black finger print eyes and a smile of course!. For older children paint their hand brown, cut it out and stick onto card, add google eyes, have the finger part pointing downwards as the legs and the thumb as the face, draw on antlers and a red nose and decorate Rudolph with sparkles! Christmas cutting, children love to look at pictures of toys they’d like, younger children love to cut and toddlers love to glue and stick. So pick up a toy catalogue next time you are out and let them, or help them to make a Christmas stocking picture of what they might like! Great for practising cutting and fine motor skills, may also give you a few ideas too! Quick tip, plastic scissors are awful to learn to cut with so do buy a normal pair BUT do watch your little one with the scissors as you don’t want your child to have a ‘home done’ hair cut at Christmas!Christmas tree, easy, easy easy - simply cut out a Christmas tree shape, let your child decorate it however they want , stick the back of it onto a toilet roll and there you have it a stand up tree!Christmas biscuits, mmmm. Make simple biscuits and use a cutter to turn them into snowmen, decorate with icing, smarties and sweet laces for a smile, then deliver to your parent and toddler group or nursery class. . Just remember these activities are meant to be fun, so don’t take over, let your child do it - not you,you want you can make one too !Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

The Foyle Ambassadors, a group of young environmentalists, completed a clean up on the upstream bank of the River Foyle near Strabane Canal with the help of TV presenter, Derry man Joe Mahon and his production crew who were filming in the area. The young people, and Joe, did a great job with over a dozen bags of rubbish removed. A team of Ulster Bank branch managers completed litter pick on the banks of the River Foyle, close to the mouth of the old Strabane Canal. Local director, Chris McGuiness, said “even though the amount of plastic waste was shocking this was an enjoyable and very worthwhile activity for our team. “We would definitely be interested in doing of this sort of environmental activity in the future.” Finally, a group of volunteers from Seagate took part in bank downstream of Strabane Canal. The volunteers could not believe how much plastic waste had accumulated in such a beautul location. Close to  bags of rubbish were removed. The Loughs Agency’s community engagement officer, Allan Bogle, said afterwards “this is the most rubbish I have seen collected during a volunteer litter pick. It is a great feeling tothis natural area to the way it is supposed to look.”Sharon McMahon, chief executive at the Loughs Agency said ‘rivers are an important habitat for fish and wildle. “Sadly, pollution, including litter and plastic gather in and along the rivers, often in remote places. River clean ups are a great way to improve our rivers and make them a more enjoyable place to visit. “As part of our community engagement programmes we are pleased to facilitate opportunities which enable the local community to take an active part in improving their environment.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He imposed all the suspended sentences concurrently and imposed a six month sentence on the latest charges.  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creative industry businesses in Derry are encouraged to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to add to their teams.Funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the programme will provide part funding to cover wage costs for employers who create the new jobs and hire a young person aged -.Run by Creative  Cultural Skills NI, the project aims to support the next generation of arts and cultural professionals and enable the growth of the sector by directly addressing skills gaps and shortages.“We want to offer greater paid opportunities to young people with the aim of eventually eradicating unpaid internships, which are so prevalent in this sector. Budgets are very tight in this sector so by offering additional funding, this programme will not only help organisations create new, exciting positions but also allow for fairer opportunities to young people,” explained Sarah Jones of Creative  Cultural Skills NI.NICEP ran as a two year pilot programme initially and this highlighted the demand for support by both industry and iniduals with  creative businesses creating  apprentices and paid intern opportunities over that period.Meacuteabh Rooney was a past participant on the programme, securing an internship with the NI Science Festival as a Marketing and Events Intern in . With a university degree in geography, she was working in retail when she spotted the post and applied for it.“The programme gave me a chance to get my first job in the creative sector. I never would have thought of event management as a career but I love it. I was hired back in  and for the upcoming festival and this year they are giving me the opportunity to take the lead in programming two big events so I’m continually learning and developing,” she explained.The organisation also benefitted from the NICEP funding and support. Chris McCreery, director of the Science Festival, explained: “We simply could never have done this without the support. It’s been hugely beneficial to us not just to have an extra team member but to have a new perspective by this smart, engaged young person. She quickly became a valued member of the team who has contributed so much to the festival.”The programme will support new jobs from a wide range of fields including music, dance, drama, literature, visual arts, craft, festivals, arts venues, community arts, galleries, museums, circus and carnival arts but will also accept applications from the wider creative sector including digital, film and TV. Employers looking to grow their staff teams and offer an opportunity to a young person, should contact the NI Creative Employment Programme team for more information.Roisin McDonough, Chief Executive of the Arts Council, said: “We want to encourage our talented young people to see the working in the arts as an attractive career option. The NI Creative Employment Programme was created to provide quality training and mentoring opportunities, to give fair access to careers in the creative and cultural industries, and help bolster the creative sector by harnessing the talent of the next generation.”For more information go to www.ccskills.org.uk or email nicep@ccskills.org.uk googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creative industry businesses in Derry are encouraged to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to add to their teams.Funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the programme will provide part funding to cover wage costs for employers who create the new jobs and hire a young person aged -.Run by Creative  Cultural Skills NI, the project aims to support the next generation of arts and cultural professionals and enable the growth of the sector by directly addressing skills gaps and shortages.“We want to offer greater paid opportunities to young people with the aim of eventually eradicating unpaid internships, which are so prevalent in this sector. Budgets are very tight in this sector so by offering additional funding, this programme will not only help organisations create new, exciting positions but also allow for fairer opportunities to young people,” explained Sarah Jones of Creative  Cultural Skills NI.NICEP ran as a two year pilot programme initially and this highlighted the demand for support by both industry and iniduals with  creative businesses creating  apprentices and paid intern opportunities over that period.Meacuteabh Rooney was a past participant on the programme, securing an internship with the NI Science Festival as a Marketing and Events Intern in . With a university degree in geography, she was working in retail when she spotted the post and applied for it.“The programme gave me a chance to get my first job in the creative sector. I never would have thought of event management as a career but I love it. I was hired back in  and for the upcoming festival and this year they are giving me the opportunity to take the lead in programming two big events so I’m continually learning and developing,” she explained.The organisation also benefitted from the NICEP funding and support. Chris McCreery, director of the Science Festival, explained: “We simply could never have done this without the support. It’s been hugely beneficial to us not just to have an extra team member but to have a new perspective by this smart, engaged young person. She quickly became a valued member of the team who has contributed so much to the festival.”The programme will support new jobs from a wide range of fields including music, dance, drama, literature, visual arts, craft, festivals, arts venues, community arts, galleries, museums, circus and carnival arts but will also accept applications from the wider creative sector including digital, film and TV. Employers looking to grow their staff teams and offer an opportunity to a young person, should contact the NI Creative Employment Programme team for more information.Roisin McDonough, Chief Executive of the Arts Council, said: “We want to encourage our talented young people to see the working in the arts as an attractive career option. The NI Creative Employment Programme was created to provide quality training and mentoring opportunities, to give fair access to careers in the creative and cultural industries, and help bolster the creative sector by harnessing the talent of the next generation.”For more information go to www.ccskills.org.uk or email nicep@ccskills.org.uk googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With his Colchester contract up next summer, Junior is taking his time to work out his next move, especially given his unexpected success at the Brandywell.“Im still on a break but Ive started a little gym programme so Im hoping to be back around the end of December,” he explained. “I definitely needed it. My body was in bits. You know how tough it is in the League of Ireland. Near the end I was struggling with knocks so it was nice to have a break. Ive never had anything like that. Im used to playing a season and having the break in the summer so its weird to find myself not playing at this time of year, but it was needed.”Returning to his parent club as the top scorer in Ireland has given Junior a strong base for negotiations in the coming weeks and months. Whilst reluctant to discuss his future at present, he did admit that he wouldnt rule out ato Derry City.“It helps me in a way but I still have got to go in and work hard and show what I can do and see what happens,” he continued. “I feel good and obviously it has given me a lot of confidence going forward but I still feel good. Im looking to see what happens in the future. “I really enjoyed my time at Derry and the people were great with me, especially the fans, my team mates and the coaching staff, they were all so good to me so I could never rule out Derry. “Its like a second home to me and it was really nice being there. I cant rule it out but Im not sure whats going to happen.” googletag.cmd.push Unknown entityJunior admits that the League of Ireland was an unknown entity to him this time last year but after huge success here, he admitted that he would recommend the league to any English player struggling to get a foothold in the English game.“The way football is played there is very good and positive and I would recommend it to any youngster who is maybe looking to kickstart their career,” he stated. “Maybe the league is a bit dferent here because of the football played, but the League of Ireland is a very good place to go and enjoy your football. “I never knew what to expect,” he insisted. “In my head I just thought it would probably by physical and hard-working.,I didnt expect a lot of teams there to be ball playing or as technical as it was. It was a big surprise but I enjoyed it. “Playing on the wing I learned a lot from that position, not just playing but scoring from that position as well. It taught me a lot and gave me a lot of confidence. It did a lot for me and it was a massive experience for me,” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held. For the first time in the history of the society one judge travelled from England to adjudicate.SHRIGLEY mdash A quantity of leather coats valued at pound, were stolen when the offices of the Ulster Leather Company at Shrigley were broken into. The thieves gained entry by smashing a window and made off with  coats.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar War Memorial Hall was packed to capacity for a concert organised by Wellington Memorial Silver Band.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
