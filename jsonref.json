She denied Amazon searched for places with low local business rates to avoid paying as much tax as competitors.Clayton Hirst, from John Lewis, told the committee that businesses like his face much higher business rates and taxes for employees compared to online-only retailers.Committee chairman Mr Betts made a formal request on the Amazon boss to provide her business rate figures and sales figures.Ms Smith said she would \u0027seek advice\u0027 before handing over the company\u0027s figures.She was questioned after shocking new statistics revealed 93,000 retail jobs have been lost in the past year amid a crunch on the high street.                                                    She added: \u0027A retailer issuing a profit warning this close to Christmas is never a good thing, but seeing one as big as Asos issuing one is quite a clubbing for an industry that has already taken a battering.\u0027Neil Wilson, who is chief market analyst at Markets.com, said the warning from Asos showed the strife extended \u0027well beyond the high street\u0027.Laura Ashley has announced it is to close 40 stores – one in four – in a \u0027challenging environment\u0027. Clothing chains Primark and Superdry have also warned of weak sales.Clayton Hirst of John Lewis said the retail sector was facing a \u0027perfect storm\u0027 of factors including falling consumer confidence and oversupply of shops, both online and physical.MPs on the Commons housing, communities and local government committee yesterday heard evidence on the future of the high street.The panel\u0027s chairman, Labour MP Clive Betts, suggested to Amazon policy chief Lesley Smith that her firm was \u0027single-handedly killing the high street\u0027.She pointed out that 82 per cent of retail sales are through bricks and mortar stores.And she argued that Amazon helped small firms – many of them with physical outlets – sell through its site.She added: \u0027People want to shop for the same things they always have done, which is price, choice and convenience. \u0027Some of that they are finding online, and that is a great opportunity, but they are also finding a lot of innovation on the high street.\u0027Mr Mulcahy told MPs that technological change was key.\u0027The problem we have here is a 20th century infrastructure in a 21st century world,\u0027 he said.\u0027It just has not adapted fast enough to the fact the internet is the main way people engage with stuff.\u0027Debenhams told the committee that it was looking to close 50 of its 166 British stores over the next three to five years as customers move online.Director of investor relations Katharine Wynne said the company was pushing \u0027click and collect\u0027 services – with changing rooms next to collection points so shoppers can try on things they have bought online and return them immediately if they do not fit.The department store chain recently turned down the offer of a £40million loan from Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct tycoon who owns one of its main competitors, House of Fraser.He is the biggest shareholder in Debenhams and has suggested the two rivals could work together.Last November Asos\u0027s stock market value topped £5billion, putting it ahead of M\u0026ampS. Yesterday it was languishing at just £2.1billion.The company said its problems were not restricted to the UK and conditions in Germany and France were becoming more challenging.

She denied Amazon searched for places with low local business rates to avoid paying as much tax as competitors.Clayton Hirst, from John Lewis, told the committee that businesses like his face much higher business rates and taxes for employees compared to online-only retailers.Committee chairman Mr Betts made a formal request on the Amazon boss to provide her business rate figures and sales figures.Ms Smith said she would \u0027seek advice\u0027 before handing over the company\u0027s figures.She was questioned after shocking new statistics revealed 93,000 retail jobs have been lost in the past year amid a crunch on the high street.                                                    She added: \u0027A retailer issuing a profit warning this close to Christmas is never a good thing, but seeing one as big as Asos issuing one is quite a clubbing for an industry that has already taken a battering.\u0027Neil Wilson, who is chief market analyst at Markets.com, said the warning from Asos showed the strife extended \u0027well beyond the high street\u0027.Laura Ashley has announced it is to close 40 stores – one in four – in a \u0027challenging environment\u0027. Clothing chains Primark and Superdry have also warned of weak sales.Clayton Hirst of John Lewis said the retail sector was facing a \u0027perfect storm\u0027 of factors including falling consumer confidence and oversupply of shops, both online and physical.MPs on the Commons housing, communities and local government committee yesterday heard evidence on the future of the high street.The panel\u0027s chairman, Labour MP Clive Betts, suggested to Amazon policy chief Lesley Smith that her firm was \u0027single-handedly killing the high street\u0027.She pointed out that 82 per cent of retail sales are through bricks and mortar stores.And she argued that Amazon helped small firms – many of them with physical outlets – sell through its site.She added: \u0027People want to shop for the same things they always have done, which is price, choice and convenience. \u0027Some of that they are finding online, and that is a great opportunity, but they are also finding a lot of innovation on the high street.\u0027Mr Mulcahy told MPs that technological change was key.\u0027The problem we have here is a 20th century infrastructure in a 21st century world,\u0027 he said.\u0027It just has not adapted fast enough to the fact the internet is the main way people engage with stuff.\u0027Debenhams told the committee that it was looking to close 50 of its 166 British stores over the next three to five years as customers move online.Director of investor relations Katharine Wynne said the company was pushing \u0027click and collect\u0027 services – with changing rooms next to collection points so shoppers can try on things they have bought online and return them immediately if they do not fit.The department store chain recently turned down the offer of a £40million loan from Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct tycoon who owns one of its main competitors, House of Fraser.He is the biggest shareholder in Debenhams and has suggested the two rivals could work together.Last November Asos\u0027s stock market value topped £5billion, putting it ahead of M\u0026ampS. Yesterday it was languishing at just £2.1billion.The company said its problems were not restricted to the UK and conditions in Germany and France were becoming more challenging.

Then, trembling, she called her mother and the police.Of course, by the time officers arrived the burglars had long gone. The policemen reassured the schoolgirl they would do everything they could to catch the intruders, who had broken in through the conservatory.Whether that actually happens, only time will tell. But her experience — brief as it was — has already had a profound impact. \u0027I just don\u0027t want to be by myself and can\u0027t sleep very well,\u0027 said Sophie. \u0027I have been having bad dreams and am scared they might come back.\u0027It\u0027s just the thought of what they might have done. It just keeps playing in mind . . . the way he looked into my eyes.\u0027Her mother Laura, meanwhile, who runs a car sales company, says: \u0027I can\u0027t even go into a shop and leave her in the car. At night she\u0027s been coming into my bed. I\u0027m not surprised — I would be the same. If the house had been empty and they\u0027d come in and stolen a couple of TVs it wouldn\u0027t have mattered. It\u0027s the fact that she was there when someone broke in that\u0027s so scary.\u0027What makes the break-in so astonishing is the sheer audacity of it. Not only did it happen in broad daylight, but there are four CCTV cameras (they weren\u0027t working at the time because the front of the house was being decorated, but the burglars didn\u0027t know that).Yet break-ins like these are becoming more common. The latest figures show that 58 per cent of burglaries occurred when the property was occupied — up from 53 per cent five years ago. At the same time, only one in ten crimes committed in England and Wales ends with anyone being charged.With budgets under pressure many forces no longer routinely investigate crimes such as burglaries, thefts and minor assaults. Which, it is claimed, sends out a message to criminals that they can go about their illicit business with little fear of being brought to book.Earlier this month pensioner Maureen Whale, 77, collapsed as she was on the phone reporting a gang of burglars who were ransacking her home in Barnet, North London, while she was inside. She died the following day.And on Sunday, an elderly wheelchair user died days after being assaulted during a burglary at his home. The 69-year-old man suffered injuries to his face and body following the break-in at his flat in Birmingham on December 10.In some ways Sophie and her mother are among the \u0027lucky\u0027 ones. Northumbria Police found a screwdriver left by the burglars. It has been sent away for DNA analysis while a number of neighbours have also come forward with descriptions, which detectives are probing.But the lasting psychological effect of such an incident cannot be underestimated. Consider the spine-chilling words of a woman whose home in Wolverhampton was broken into in the early hours last year.She was awoken by the sound of breaking glass and stayed hidden as the thief shone a torch into the downstairs room where she and her four-year-old son were asleep. Her daughter, ten, was asleep upstairs.\u0027Every second was fear, panic and shock — I have struggled with flashbacks of the night ever since,\u0027 said the 29-year-old in a witness impact statement delivered to a court last month, ahead of the intruder being sentenced to three years in jail.\u0027When he entered I hid under the covers with my son trying to call the police and praying that I could get help. I heard him go upstairs and into my daughter\u0027s room — this is something that still makes my blood run cold.\u0027My instincts were to chase him upstairs, but I couldn\u0027t as I didn\u0027t know at this stage if the police were on their way. I couldn\u0027t leave my son.\u0027And she added: \u0027Mentally we have been to hell and back.\u0027How do you tell a child they are safe to go to sleep when they know this might not be true?\u0027While in this instance the burglar was traced thanks to DNA left at the scene on a baseball cap, elsewhere victims of crime say police are all too often reluctant to carry out anything but the most superficial enquiries.It was reported last month that Britain\u0027s biggest police force is dismissing about a third of all reported crimes after only one telephone call with the victim.Burglaries, low-level assaults, criminal damage, theft and affray can all be dismissed without being investigated under a policy introduced by the Met Police last year.The danger of this approach, say experts, is that it both sends out the wrong message to criminals and leaves victims feeling abandoned.          Laura Thompson whose daughter Sophie, 14, disturbed two burglars who had broken into her home in Annitsford, NorthumberlandBarbara Oakley, operations manager at Victim Support, says: \u0027You want someone to come along and say: \u0027This is what you\u0027ll do next, this is what we will do next.\u0027\u0027You don\u0027t just want to make a phone call and then be left to tidy up the mess, and with all the fear. I think an officer turning up, taking you seriously, goes a long way with the public. Burglary is seen as one of the most personal crimes, because it is your information or your personal space that has been invaded.\u0027Indeed, according to a survey by alarm company Verisure 17 per cent of burglary victims are so badly affected by the experience they move home.Among them is chef Anthony Mercer, who was living with his sister near Rochdale when his house was broken into last summer. As the pair slept upstairs, a burglar or burglars broke in through a window.The following morning they woke up and came downstairs to discover the television, camera equipment, an Xbox and computer hard-drives worth thousands of pounds had been taken. Also missing was 36-year-old Mr Mercer\u0027s car, a Vauxhall Corsa, into which the gang had loaded up the stolen goods.The following day, police stopped the car, arresting the driver who was also found to be in possession of an imitation Samurai sword. Despite being caught red-handed, Mr Mercer was informed by police that the youth was subsequently dealt with by a youth rehabilitation order.\u0027If he had a weapon then you can only assume he had it when he broke into the house,\u0027 said Mr Mercer. \u0027It\u0027s terrifying. At the end of the day your home is your safe-haven. You presume that you are safe. Not feeling safe in your own house is an horrific thing.\u0027Now if there is any kind of noise, I\u0027m awake, bolt upright in bed, looking out the windows to see what\u0027s going on. You worry — is it happening again? I\u0027ve suffered from sleeplessness, fearfulness, general uneasiness.\u0027 Indeed, Mr Mercer has since moved to a \u0027quieter\u0027 area.As an emergency services worker Lucy Mackcracken knows the financial pressures the police are under. But when her house was burgled at the end of June as she slept upstairs with her husband James and five-year-old daughter Emilia, she expected the family would at least get a visit from police.Intruders had forced open the lock of a downstairs door at the detached property in Birmingham, entering the kitchen and taking the keys for her brand-new A Class Mercedes.The family slept through the raid, only discovering the car had gone the following morningHaving dialled 101 to report the crime, they received a visit from a forensics officer. They were then told that they would also have a visit from police who would investigate the crime. But no one came that day — or any other.\u0027In the end they said they were so busy they couldn\u0027t get to us,\u0027 said Mrs Mackcracken, who works in human resources for the ambulance service and was heavily pregnant at the time of the burglary.\u0027They told us they were going to knock on neighbours\u0027 doors but we didn\u0027t see them do that and none of our neighbours said they have done that. I was really disappointed and felt very vulnerable.\u0027For my daughter to have seen that something bad happened and the police haven\u0027t come to help us, it\u0027s left a bit of a mark in her mind.\u0027Police forces across the country have experienced big cuts in government funding that have led to a fall of more than 20,000 officers over the past eight years.And yet there are concerns that priorities have become distorted — with \u0027core policing\u0027 duties such as investigating burglaries and violent crimes being ignored in the drive to tackle hate crime. An offence becomes classified as a hate crime when the victim considers it to have been driven by hostility against their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity.Since 2013 the number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled to 94,000 last year. Recently, a raft of senior police officers have voiced their concerns. Sara Thornton, who chairs the National Police Chiefs Council, said forces lack the manpower to pursue or even record every issue raised. \u0027I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes,\u0027 she said.          Maureen Whale collapsed as burglars were ransacking her home in LondonShe was backed by Cressida Dick, commissioner of the MetPolice, who backed calls to return to \u0027traditional values\u0027 and priorities.Consider, by way of example, a couple of cases dealt with recently by Thames Valley Police.This is a force which closes investigations without identifying a suspect in seven out of ten household burglaries and reported vehicle thefts. And yet it recently emerged it had spent three years and thousands of pounds on a case involving a 70-year-old woman accused of beeping her horn at a black woman during a disagreement at a petrol station.Despite part-time charity worker Jane Savidge denying she had even known who was at the wheel of the vehicle, she was accused of racial abuse, something she vehemently denies. Yet Thames Valley Police have still recorded what had happened as a racially motivated \u0027hate crime\u0027.Outraged that her version of events has been ignored, and fearing the slur of being branded racist would affect her charitable work, she has been fighting the force for three years to get them to change their records — to no avail.The force\u0027s diligence in that matter does not play well with 57-year-old David Holley, who lives near Bicester in Oxfordshire. In January his £12,000 caravan was stolen from in front of his house in the early hours. Although the criminals didn\u0027t enter his property, knowing they were just outside his front door still frightens David.\u0027I called the police immediately, and told them the thieves had left behind broken locks that could be of interest forensically and that there was CCTV footage of the them coming and going in a car.\u0027But it was almost a week before the first officer visited the scene, and almost three weeks before they checked CCTV and carried out house-to-house enquiries. He says he was told that the delay did not matter because \u0027the number plates would almost certainly be false\u0027.NASA engineer comes up with epic revenge package to catch...A Bronx tale of redemption? \u0027Hollywood loves a good...Share this articleUnsurprisingly, no arrests were made, prompting Mr Holley to complain about the force\u0027s \u0027unwillingness to investigate\u0027.Mr Holley, who works for a private bank, says: \u0027There was no attempt to do anything to recover the property I\u0027d had stolen. I feel very, very badly let down.\u0027 But Thames Valley Police rejected his complaint, and a subsequent appeal.\u0027This does not come down to an unwillingness to investigate, it comes down to the number of resources we as a service have to deploy,\u0027 an officer wrote to Mr Holley. \u0027We can\u0027t investigate every theft and difficult choices have to be made.\u0027Talking of the two cases, a spokesman added: \u0027The way hate incidents are investigated, and the way burglaries are investigated, are clearly very different, but as with all offences, Thames Valley Police has a duty to investigate. The investigation of hate-related crimes and incidents does not have any impact on the investigation of burglaries or any other crimes.\u0027Whether such assurances will deter those intent on spoiling someone else\u0027s Christmas by burgling homes and stealing possessions — whether they\u0027re in the property or not — is another matter."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/18/10/432CB97200000578-0-A_new_referendum_would_take_almost_six_months_at_least_to_pass_t-a-2_1545130183102.jpg","title":"Fifty GLORIOUS years Mac joyous celebration Daily Mail legendary cartoonist","story":"Stan \u0027Mac\u0027 McMurty,  \u0027a Daily Mail legend whose warmth and wit made him Britain’s greatest cartoonist\u0027Back in the mid-Seventies, the American actor John Wayne announced that he was coming to the UK to make a film called Brannigan. My cartoon in the Daily Mail the next day captured the excitement of The Duke’s arrival.After it was published, his agent got in touch, saying that Mr Wayne would like the original cartoon. I asked if I could hand it over personally. ‘OK,’ said the agent. ‘Be at the Connaught hotel at twelve tomorrow.’ My editor thought this was a great photo-opportunity, so he sent a photographer with me.A similar request had been made to the cartoonist of the Evening News, Bernard Cookson, so he with his photographer and I with mine turned up at the Connaught.‘Guys,’ his agent said as we met in the foyer, ‘I have bad news. The Duke has been called to the TV studios so he isn’t able to meet you.’Seeing our disappointment, he said: ‘But the Duke feels so badly about it he wants to buy you lunch. So go up to his apartment and room service will attend to whatever you want.’The idiot! Letting four journalists loose in John Wayne’s apartment? We were in there nearly all afternoon. We ate a sumptuous lunch, washed down with copious amounts of wine. We smoked his cigars and ended up with a brandy or two.I kept expecting John Wayne to appear in the doorway as he had in so many Westerns, and blast us all with his six-guns. So if his former agent is still alive and reading this, I apologise for taking such advantage of his hospitality. Unforgivable!          If you’d told me when I was a young man that this was the kind of adventure I’d enjoy as a Fleet Street cartoonist, I would have taken it with a very large pinch of salt. Back then I was grateful to find any kind of gainful employment at all.Almost exactly 62 years ago, at the age of 20, I was nearing the end of a two-year stint in the Army and wondering what I should do with myself when I became a civilian once more.Although I’d been to art college before my National Service, there didn’t seem to be any job prospects in the offing. But quite honestly, looking back, I can’t remember being overly worried about being out of work.I’ve always embraced the philosophy that ‘something will turn up’ and, as it turned out, I was right. With about a month to go before I was penniless, I received a letter from an old friend telling me her son was starting a cartoon animation company in Henley-on-Thames, and was looking for young artists to train as animators.I applied, got the job and, thanks to the skill, patience and friendship of my new boss, Nick Spargo, took my first steps into the world of cartooning.MAC on... the failed Tory coup  Sonic the Hedgehog fans get prickly after the SEGA video...Share this articleNick turned me from a lazy slob into a hardworking, eager-to-learn slob, and two or three years later I became one of his key animators. I wasn’t earning much money but was enjoying every minute.After a film was completed, there would often be a three or four-week gap while we waited for a new commission, and I used that spare time, sometimes working well into the night, to send gag cartoons off to any newspaper or magazine that carried cartoons.It took four years of bombarding the Press with my humble offerings — and accumulating hundreds of reject slips — before one brave publisher bought a cartoon. At last!I was sent a cheque for eleven pounds and ten shillings — a huge amount of money for one rather bad drawing, considering that at that time I was only earning ten pounds a week as an animator. I decided there and then that this was what I wanted to do: become a newspaper cartoonist.          That meant leaving the animation studio and becoming a freelancer — a step into the unknown. To pay the rent and feed my family, I drew three pages a week for children’s comics. I illustrated articles in various magazines written by scientists, golfers, squash players, joggers, chess masters and any other grey page of print that needed brightening up. I tried my hand at cards for birthdays, weddings, Valentine’s, births and getting well soon. Anything to earn a crust.But my priority was to get known as a gag cartoonist, and I think it was through my work in Punch magazine that I was noticed by the editor of the Daily Sketch (a sister paper of the Daily Mail), who got in touch and asked if I’d like to have a go at being that paper’s social and political cartoonist.It was an offer too good to refuse, and for me a dream come true. That was 50 years ago. Two years later, The Daily Sketch was closed down and absorbed by the Daily Mail. I was one of the lucky ones who moved over to the more popular paper.Despite all that, for me it has been the most remarkable half a century. I still can’t quite believe so many decades have slipped by. It has been a thrilling ride. I have worked, and still do, with some wonderfully gifted journalists who have become friends as well as colleagues. Doors have been unexpectedly opened for me, small privileges granted and excitements provided.I remember drawing a cartoon of the Beatles when they were the most famous band in the world. At the time I enjoyed their music but thought they, like most pop groups, would have a limited time in the limelight, then be forgotten. So I wasn’t overexcited when their agent got in touch to ask for the original drawing.      I sent it to him, then forgot about it. Two weeks later a crate of Glenfiddich whisky arrived at my office, together with the fab four’s Abbey Road LP, signed by each of the Beatles.Among the many other highlights were being asked for a drawing by Frank Sinatra and receiving a signed thank-you letter, being sent theatre tickets by Sir Laurence Olivier and stripping off at a nudist colony to hand over an original.I have also been invited to Downing Street by Margaret Thatcher, awarded ‘Cartoonist of the year’ seven times, written a successful children’s book and, best of all, been presented with an MBE — and had a friendly chat — with Her Majesty The Queen.Regular readers of the Daily Mail will probably know that for many years I have drawn within each cartoon a small sketch of my wife Liz’s face. She is always hidden somewhere in the daily drawing — perhaps in the pattern of a curtain, in a puddle or in the branches of a tree. She has become so popular that I am sent cuttings by readers who have had difficulty finding her, asking me to pinpoint where she is hidden.Sadly, my darling wife passed away in 2017 from motor neurone disease, so in her memory I have continued to include her each day in my cartoon.Dear readers, it has been a wonderful 50 years. Full of challenges, remarkable stories, fun and laughter. So what have I learnt? That older people are much easier to draw: more lines, fewer teeth! Golda Meir, the former Israeli prime minister, was a good example, and Donald Trump was a gift from heaven for cartoonists.David Cameron, with his shiny face, was fairly easy. So, too, were Ted Heath, Harold Wilson with his pipe and Margaret Thatcher with her bouffant hairstyle.          I always struggle with beautiful young women . . . let me rephrase that. I always find them harder to draw. Not only young women but young men, too. Tony Blair was difficult when he was first elected but somehow became easier as he grew older.But all good things come to an end, and I have reluctantly decided to hang up my pencil. After this week, a wonderful new cartoonist will be taking my place, and I’m sure you’ll enjoy his work. Thank you for the support and all the delightful letters and emails you’ve sent me over the years. Have a great Christmas and a healthy, happy New Year. Goodbye!             Did YOU spot the love of his life hidden  in each cartoon?It was the parlour game we all loved to play — in every cartoon he ever drew, Mac cleverly disguised an outline drawing of his beloved wife Liz. Some were harder to find than others — like the ones we’ve circled on this page...

It has two swimming pools, two spas and five restaurants.The voyage will begin at Dover on June 2, and the vessel will sail to D-Day events on the South Coast before heading over to Normandy on the anniversary itself, June 6.The full programme, including events in France, will be announced in the New Year.Bob Gamble, of the Royal British Legion, said: ‘Seventy-five years ago, the largest seaborne invasion force in history set sail for France on a mission to liberate Europe.‘Today we stand in awe of their achievement and salute their bravery and sacrifice.’Veteran Alan King, 95, a tank radio operator with the East Riding Yeomanry, said: ‘I’m looking forward to marking the anniversary with the prospect of travelling on the Legion’s chartered ship.          The 880-passenger cruise ship the Boudicca, owned by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, will ferry 300 veterans and a guest or carer each to the beaches on which they battled in 1944‘It provides me with the opportunity to meet other veterans and also ensure I can visit the grave, as I do every year, of my tank commander who was killed in action. I place my beret on his grave and salute him.’Peter Deer, of Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, which owns Boudicca, said next June’s charter would be ‘poignant and moving’.He added: ‘The voyage will follow the same path as the ships involved on this momentous day, and we hope that Boudicca will provide a comfortable setting in which to retrace those important steps.’Other veterans will be returning to Normandy next year courtesy of the D-Day Revisited scheme, which has been organising pilgrimages for ten years.The Allied invasion of Normandy, known as D-Day, took place on June 6, 1944, and involved more than 80,000 British and Canadian troops alongside US forces.          On June 6 1944 Operation Overload - the land invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe - involved more than 80,000 British, Canadian and Commonwealth troops alongside US forcesThe invasion was the first stage in the liberation of Europe from Nazi occupation, which ultimately led to victory for the Allies in 1945.On the 70th anniversary in 2014, veteran Bernard Jordan, 89, won the hearts of the nation by making his very own Great Escape, slipping out of his East Sussex care home and catching a ferry to Normandy to honour his fallen ‘mates’. Mr Jordan died aged 90 in 2015. Veterans interested in travelling on the cruise liner should contact the Legion for an application form, to be returned by Monday, February 4. Each veteran will be entitled to travel with one guest or carer.A ballot will be held if more applications from eligible veterans are received than the number of available spaces on the ship. "},{"url":null,"title":"On brink Polar bears tip toe edge melting Arctic iceberg","story":"One the brink of extinction: Tip-toeing on the edge of a melting Arctic iceberg cliff, two polar bears dice with death in their dwindling natural habitat.

He had a major influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson and on American transcendentalism. He was renowned for The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and made reference to his home town in his work Frost at Midnight.Coleridge spent the last eighteen years of his life at Highgate as a patient under the care of Dr James Gillman.It was then that he wrote several works which were to have tremendous influence on the future course of English thought in many fields.This included Biographia literaria (1817), Lay Sermons (1817), Aids to Reflection (1825), and The Constitution of Church and State (1829).Coleridge died in 1834 at Highgate, leaving behind notes that scholars of the mid-twentieth century found and began editing.

Putin discussed a host of important political and diplomatic issues in the marathon press conference.Here, we round up some of his most important answers: On America\u0027s threat to quit the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty\u0027We are essentially witnessing the breakdown of the international arms control order and (the start of) an arms race.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s very hard to imagine how the situation will develop (if the US quits). If these missiles appear in Europe what should we do? Of course, we\u0027ll have to ensure our own security.\u0027On western sanctions\u0027Russia throughout almost all of its history has been under some sort of sanctions... This is to do with the growth of Russia\u0027s power and its ability to compete. A new player has appeared which must be taken into consideration.\u0027\u0027Our economy has adapted to these external constraints... And look, there\u0027s also some advantages to this sanctions story. In what sense? It has forced us to switch on our brains in relation to many things.\u0027On UK-Russia ties and Brexit \u0027It is in the interests of both countries, both governments to get out of this deadlock.\u0027\u0027In terms of Brexit, if it is carried through to the end, I can understand the prime minister\u0027s (Theresa May\u0027s) position... There was a referendum after all. What can she do? She must enact the will of the people, expressed during the referendum.\u0027          Russian double agent Sergei Skripal (pictured) was left in critical condition after two Russian spies poisoned him in SalisburyOn meeting Trump soon\u0027I don\u0027t know if such a meeting will happen or not.\u0027\u0027Will he be able to enter direct dialogue with Russia? I don\u0027t know, you need to ask them.\u0027\u0027We must normalise our bilateral relations, we are ready for this, as soon as the other side is ready too.\u0027On Maria Butina and Skripal poisoning cases On Maria Butina, accused in the United States of being a Russian agent of influence: \u0027I don\u0027t understand what she is supposed to confess to. She did not carry out any orders from Russian security services. I don\u0027t understand why she was jailed, there are no grounds for it.\u0027On former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, who was poisoned in Britain with his daughter Yulia: \u0027It\u0027s good that he wasn\u0027t killed... Thank God, Skripal is alive.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s simply an excuse to organise yet another attack on Russia. If there were no Skripals, they would have come up with something else, that\u0027s clear to me.\u0027On Russian capture of Ukrainian sailors  \u0027Provocations are always bad. A provocation aims to escalate the situation. Why do our Ukrainian partners need this development? They need to escalate the situation around the elections, to raise the rating of one candidate for the post. Did the provocation achieve its aims? In terms of raising ratings, maybe.\u0027          Ukrainian army reservists use an anti-aircraft gun as they take part in military exercises in the Army Training Center on WednesdayOn conflict with Ukraine in Azov Sea  \u0027We have an agreement from 2003... We are ready to stick to these agreements and not announce one-sided actions.\u0027\u0027When it comes to military vessels, they have to be in touch with our border guards... In the context of martial law I find it difficult to imagine, how military vessels will roam around. But overall, we would like to normalise everything (in the Azov Sea).\u0027On growth and the economy \u0027Inflation remains at levels that we welcome... We will go outside the Central Bank\u0027s 4 percent reference point somewhat.\u0027\u0027We can\u0027t create GDP growth for the breakthrough we need without changing the structure of our economy. That\u0027s what our national goals are geared towards... to giving the economic structure an innovative character.\u0027\u0027From 2021, the government is planning for 3 percent growth, even more perhaps.\u0027          The Russian president\u0027s annual news conference is a chance for reporters to quiz him on pressing issues such as new laws, economic growth and global relationsOn a VAT rise and inflation \u0027I expect that this (the increase in prices) will be a one-off... Recently, they (the central bank) decided to increase the (key) rate by 0.25 percentage points. There are pluses and minuses but this is done also to avoid an increase in inflation and prices. So in general I think that the decision (to raise VAT) was right.\u0027On use of the dollar \u0027The volume of our gold and currency reserves in dollars has fallen.\u0027\u0027De-dollarisation is exclusively to do with transactions in between economic agents, not citizens.\u0027\u0027There has been and will be no (ban on the use of the dollar).\u0027\u0027The exchange rate needs to be stable. And overall we have been managing to do this lately.\u0027On grain and agriculture \u0027We retain and have even grown our grain export potential to 52.5 million tonnes. We will fulfil all of our responsibilities and contracts.\u0027          Putin said he agrees with Trump that ISIS has been defeated. Pictured: The ruined Syrian city of Raqqa, the one time capital of the Islamic State caliphateOn Kurils territorial dispute with Japan\u0027The U.S. base on Okinawa has been there for decades now... We don\u0027t understand the level of sovereignty Japan has when such decisions are made.\u0027What will happen after a peace agreement is signed, we don\u0027t know. But without an answer to this question, it will be very difficult for us to take any major decisions.\u0027On announcement of US withdrawal from Syria\u0027In terms of the victory over Islamic State, overall I agree with President Trump.\u0027\u0027In terms of the withdrawal of U.S. troops, I don\u0027t know what this is about. The U.S. has had a presence in Afghanistan for 17 years, let\u0027s say? And almost every year it says that it is withdrawing troops from there. But they are still present there.\u0027\u0027We don\u0027t see any indication of U.S. withdrawing troops as of yet but I accept that it may be happening.\u0027On private military contractors\u0027Everyone must remain within the bounds of the law... I repeat, they are not breaking Russian law and have the right to work and promote their business interests wherever they like in the world.\u0027\u0027If this Wagner Group (name of Russian military contractor) is breaking any laws, the prosecutor\u0027s office must give its legal opinion.\u0027On Ukraine setting up its own church\u0027Undoubtedly it has a political rationale.

deals that helped bring in new users and, as a result, drove up its advertising revenue. Facebook\u0027s \u0027People You May Know\u0027, a friend suggestion tool on the site, was one such feature in which the social media giant utilized data acquired by its partners. The tool has been controversial since it was introduced in 2008, sometimes suggesting connections between estranged family members or even a victim and their harasser.   Facebook\u0027s business partners were exempted from the site\u0027s usual privacy rules through the deals, according to internal records. The deals - made with tech businesses, online retailers, automakers, entertainment sites, and media organizations - date back to 2010 and all were still active in 2017. Some still remained in effect this year, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal plagued Facebook and raised numerous concerns about how it was handling its users\u0027 data. Following the controversy, Zuckerberg told Congress in April that Facebook users now \u0027have complete control\u0027 over everything they share on the site.           Amazon was allowed to obtain users\u0027 names and contact information through their friends, and Yahoo could view streams of friends\u0027 postsBut an extensive investigation by the Times has revealed that wasn\u0027t the case as it interviewed more than 50 former Facebook employees and government officials and reviewed more than 270 pages of the company\u0027s internal documents. The Times also performed a number of technical tests to determine exactly what information was being passed between Facebook to its partner websites. Facebook made deals with over 60 makers of smartphones, including Apple. Records show that Apple devices could access users\u0027 contact numbers and calendar entries, even if those same users had disabled all sharing. Apple was also given the ability to hide the fact that its devices were asking for data from Facebook\u0027s users. And Yandex, a Russian social media company  accused of having ties to the Kremlin, could access Facebook users\u0027 unique IDs as recently as 2017 - despite the fact that Facebook had stopped sharing them with other applications for years due to security concerns. Facebook began dabbling in data sharing in 2009, suddenly making some of the information of 400 million of its users available to all of the World Wide Web. It also began sharing information about its users, including their locations and religion, to partners such as Microsoft. Facebook claimed this practice - which it dubbed \u0027instant personalization\u0027 - would help customize the internet to people\u0027s preferences and make the online world a more enjoyable and personal experience for everyone. But the FTC soon caught wind of what Facebook was doing and found that the social media giant had defied promises to keep its users\u0027 information private. Facebook entered into the consent agreement with the FTC, even hiring chief privacy officers and auditor Privewaterhouse Coopers to oversee its practices. But still, records show, the deals that Facebook had made with major companies persisted. Some were even vetted by Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Two years after the consent agreement, Facebook had agreed to so many partnerships that a tool was built to turn this special access on and off.            The shocking expose comes as Sheryl Sandberg (pictured Tuesday) was doing damage control after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential electionFormer employees revealed that the same privacy team touted to the FTC only had a limited ability to review these data-sharing partnerships. Facebook has claimed that most of these data partnerships were exempted from the FTC agreement because they were only working \u0027for and at the direction of\u0027 the social media site.   But that claim has been disputed by a number of former FTC officials.\u0027The only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth in an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u0027 said former FTC chief technologist Ashkan Soltani. \u0027This is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u0027 added David Vladeck, who ran the FTC consumer protection bureau. \u0027I don\u0027t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u0027 Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says the company needs to do...Mark Zuckerberg lost $15BILLION during a year of...Share this articleA Netflix spokesman said: \u0027Over the years we have tried various ways to make Netflix more social.

Don’t panic – our guide will help you get organised, giving you more time to relax and enjoy the festive season. Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets.

Should we blame evolution or the advent of 24-hour shopping? The experts explain … With our busy lives, Christmas often seems to creep up on us – but the truth is we all know it’s coming. So why is it that just days before, we find ourselves stationed in an unlikely department store aisle, frozen to the spot in a state of panic over what we’re supposed to be buying? Despite the frequent jolly jingles and festive reminders that December is upon us, many of us still find ourselves among the unprepared each and every year. Why do we do it? We asked the experts to explain …Blame our ancestorsAt a basic level, it could all be down to evolutionary psychology, explains Prof Craig Jackson, head of psychology at Birmingham City University. “Evolutionary psychology looks at our behaviour thousands of years ago, and whether any of those primitive basic behaviours exist today,” he says. “Consumer and crowd psychology – the way we make decisions as shoppers and behave in crowds – is a behaviour that has evolved and helped keep us alive. You’ll see it come into play if there is a scarcity of resources – when stocks of a popular children’s toy or beauty product that everybody is clamouring for run low, for example.” In which case, reckons Jackson, an impulse is triggered in us to “get” that resource. “That’s when we behave irrationally – buying quickly, and often paying more for the security of having that item safely, without really thinking about why we’re doing it, or whether it’s a good idea.” It’s all beginning to make sense.What a gift really meansThere’s also the fact that a gift isn’t just a gift, is it? According to therapist Sally Baker, anxiety over how the gift will be viewed and judged means we find ourselves procrastinating over purchases further. “We’re frozen into inactivity because, in 2018, a gift needs to speak volumes. Current economic uncertainty increases financial stress and we’re also increasingly time-poor, which leaves us panicking over the perfect way to express our love and gratitude towards those around us,” she says. Is it any wonder we’re all leaving it until the last minute?Panic stationsEver thought about the shopping process? It only adds to our panic, explains Jackson. “Present buying at Christmas time means we’re heavily influenced by crowd behaviour, since everybody is shopping at once. That behaviour can be irrational, spontaneous and hard to predict,” he says. “You just have to watch an old-fashioned market trader to realise how effectively crowds can influence behaviour – with a couple of ‘plants’ in the crowd, ‘demand’ suddenly creates mass hysteria, leading to a huge surge in panic buying.” It’s not just IRL shopping either. “Online shopping creates a sense of urgency and panic too,” he says. “You’ll often see reminders of how many minutes you have left before your purchase leaves your basket, or pop-ups telling you how many people are looking at the same product, and how many are in stock.”Timing is crucialAnother reason we’re making bad decisions when it comes to those special gifts is down to when we’re actually making those purchases, says Jackson. “Internet shopping is open 247, which means we’re able to buy items at any point during the day – or night. This undoubtedly makes life more efficient, but it also means many of us are buying when our mind isn’t at its most logical – perhaps at 2am when we’re tired, lonely, upset or feeling irrational (or worse, when we’ve had a drink).”How to nail itSo what’s the answer? If you are planning ahead and are considering a laptop as a present, for example, and are unsure about which model to go for, one of the next-generation designs is a safe bet (see below). These laptops use Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, for increased performance and better battery life.Ultimately, according to Baker, nailing present buying is really about listening to those around us. “Make notes throughout the year – if somebody mentions they love a perfume you’re wearing, jot it down so you don’t forget. Gifts are about really listening to people and showing you’ve considered their feelings – whether it’s a colour they like, or a soundtrack or designer that brings them joy.” And keeping tabs on what your loved ones would appreciate throughout the year means less shopping drama when the festivities do finally arrive. Which means more time for mulled wine and mince pies ...If a next-generation laptop is on your Christmas shopping list, then look out for one of the latest models. They’re thinner, lighter and faster than previous versions, and the models listed below are all available from AO.Acer Swift 5 14” (£999)If you want a laptop that is really portable, the Acer Swift 5 could be the answer – a thin and ultra-lightweight model that is great for taking out and about.

Here’s how to nix itWhen it comes to enjoyable Christmas activities, gift shopping is up there with an 8am meeting the morning after your festive work bash. The problem is that – very much like turkey on its third day – some recipients are tough.Jeff Galak, associate professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, studies gift-giving behaviour, and finds most of us make two key mistakes. First, believing the amount we spend is directly proportionate to how much it will be liked. “Research shows recipients typically don’t care how expensive a gift was,” he says. Second, we go off-list. “Givers think the best gifts are unrequested, spontaneous and novel. In reality, most recipients want what they want.” So, if in doubt, ask. But if you’re met with “I don’t know” (as disappointing a comeback as “No, I don’t have the receipt”), follow this expert-sourced list to win over Christmas’s trickiest customers.Challenge 1: Your boss or clientThe tongue-in-cheek gift you think they’ll see the funny side of? Put it back – unless you like your nut roast with a side of P45. “Beware of getting something that makes the relationship too familiar,” warns Galak, who suggests going traditional and work-related: a nice pen, a monogrammed leather notebook, high-end stationery. “Everyone eats and drinks, so that’s a safe bet, too,” adds Katie Shapley, managing director of The Organisers, a bespoke personal assistant and shopping service.Challenge 2: The person who has everything“My rule is always quality over quantity,” explains Milda Chellingsworth, founder of personal shopping and stylist service Styling for You. An example? If their hobby is cooking, buy them a cookery course. If they have a favourite author, get a signed edition. If you can’t speak to them before they’ve had caffeine, invest in a state-of-the-art coffee machine (see below) – there are bean-to-cup options for every budget. “The worst thing is to buy a load of knick-knacks as they’ll end up dumped in the drawer. I hear time and time again from clients: ‘Oh, it’s so-and-so’s birthday coming up, so I’ll just re-gift that thing I never use.’”Challenge 3: Secret SantaThe £10 budget cap might be easy on the wallet, but for your brain it’s the gift equivalent of an eggnog hangover. “One of the big challenges in workplace gift exchanges is that they are often seen as a competition,” says Galak. Plus, you might not know that person particularly well. “It’s a situation where we feel self-conscious (since everyone knows what everyone gets).” At group present-opening parties, an easy hit is an activity that can be done together, such as photo-booth props or the Donald Trump “fake news” game, where you guess if certain quotes came from him.Challenge 4: The person you’ve bought for a million times before“When I ask male clients for information about their wife, I always hear: ‘She loves handbags,’” says Chellingsworth. “But how many handbags must she already own? Does she really want another one that she hasn’t picked herself? I ask them to tell me something more. And that’s when I hear: ‘Oh yeah, she did mention this new place that she wants to go to.’ That’s perfect. Make gifting an opportunity to spend time together.”Ask what they want. “If this feels taboo, ask a close friend of the recipient – this way you get the benefit of giving the right gift, as well as the benefit of it being a surprise,” advises Galak.Don’t pad a gift out. A US study (Presenter’s Paradox) found that adding a small stocking filler to an expensive gift actually reduced how much the recipient thought someone had spent.Make a list. “Because sales start so early now, you go into a shop, buy loads of stuff and then think: ‘Who can I give this to?’” explains Chellingsworth. “It’s less overwhelming to spend an hour thinking of a present for each person, and then shop.”If you fancy controlling your espresso from your smartphone or prefer to make bean-to-cup coffee, look no further than this selection of De’Longhi machines (check online for the latest prices).De’Longhi PrimadonaFor the coffee aficionado.

Then will Father Christmas die too?” The story has been handed down the generations like a recipe for plum pudding, savoured for the deft way it knits the novelist and the midwinter festival together into one cosy stocking. Just the phrase “costermonger’s daughter” suggests all sorts of Dickensian themes – city grime, cheap street food, the capacity of innocent children to rise lispingly above the squalor of their circumstance. But what often gets missed is the way that the little girl’s question – if she really existed, if she ever said it – assumes how vulnerable Christmas is. Just like Mr Dickens, it could be snatched away at a moment’s notice.It is 175 years since Dickens published A Christmas Carol, the 28,000-word novella that lay down the template for how we now celebrate (or make a point of resisting) Christmas. Prince Albert and his imported fir tree of 1841 made a contribution, of course, and so did Henry Cole and his Christmas cards of 1843, and a London sweet-maker called Tom Smith who came up with crackers in 1847. But Christmas was pulled together, codified, made visible in story and painted in sound by Dickens who dashed down A Christmas Carol in six weeks in the autumn of 1843. The book, published on 19 December of that year, famously tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a bitter old miser who is given a chance to redeem himself when he is visited in turn by four ghosts on Christmas Eve. As a result of their warning about what will happen if he fails to change his ways, the grasping old skinflint repents of his life-denying selfishness. Flushed with goodwill, he lavishes a delicious Christmas dinner on the family of his shabby and exploited clerk, Bob Cratchit.To mark the anniversary of A Christmas Carol, the Charles Dickens Museum in Clerkenwell, London, has mounted an exhibition that is replete with all the signifiers of what has become known as a “Dickensian Christmas” but which is also, simultaneously, Dickens’s Christmas. From 1837 to 1839 Charles, his wife Catherine and their growing brood lived at 48 Doughty Street in a solid late-Georgian terrace. On display you will find the silver punch ladles with which the master of the house liked to spoon out the boozy, lemony festive drink that he made each year according to his own recipe. In the back kitchen you can see the family “copper” – a built-in brick water heater – in which Mrs Dickens simmered the plum pudding, just as frazzled Mrs Cratchit does in A Christmas Carol (since the copper was mostly used for boiling laundry it’s no surprise that the Cratchits’ pudding comes out smelling slightly of soapy old sheets). The drawing room at Doughty Street, meanwhile, is decked with the boughs of holly and mistletoe that gleam so brightly in Chapter 28 of The Pickwick Papers when Mr Pickwick, Sam Weller and their posse descend on Dingly Dell on 22 December for a fortnight of mid-winter frolic.It was at Doughty Street, and later at the nearby addresses to which he moved his family, that Dickens would habitually enact his version of the festival. “Christmas was always a time which in our home was looked forward to with eagerness and delight,” recalled his eldest daughter, Mamie, who was born at Doughty Street. Younger brother Henry chimed in: “My father was always at his best, a splendid host, bright and jolly as a boy and throwing his heart and soul into everything.” Guests would be offered a turkey dinner followed by a dazzling display of magic tricks courtesy of Boz himself. Dickens had only to wave his hands over a gentleman’s top hat for a steaming plum pudding to emerge a box of bran was transformed into a live guinea pig. Even Jane Carlyle, a regular guest who could generally be counted on to say something spiky, was obliged to admit that Mr Dickens was “the best conjuror I ever saw (and I have paid money to see several)”.Yet, as this thoughtful exhibition hints, Dickens’s hectic high spirits – at one point, says Mrs Carlyle, the naturally abstemious novelist appeared positively drunk with delight at his own sleights of hand – were driven by something darker. You have only to look at the novels to see how Christmas is often skating on thin ice. In Great Expectations Pip passes on a pork pie intended for Christmas dinner to the escaped convict Magwitch, a good deed that will blight his life. In The Mystery of Edwin Drood, the young hero goes missing on Christmas Eve, leaving behind several clues that he has been murdered by his uncle. Saddest of all, in A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is forced by the Ghost of Christmas Past to observe himself as a boy abandoned at school over the festive season, and weeps “to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be”.The real-life roots of Dickens’s affinity with hunger, dispossession and cancelled Christmases have been identified many times. One nightmarish year when he was 12, young Charles was deprived of a home life following his feckless father’s imprisonment for debt. Wrenched out of school, the boy was set to work in a rat-infested blacking factory on the banks of the Thames, returning each night to grim lodgings in Camden Town. Permanently ravenous, on his daily stomach-rumbling walk to work he would stop in Tottenham Court Road to spend his precious dinner money on a stale half-price pastry. So great was the trauma of this shameful year that as an adult Dickens ulged the details only to his best friend John Forster and Catherine. It is all there, though, in David Copperfield, his autobiographical novel of 1849-50, as well as in the narratives of those other fledgling boy heroes who have fallen out of the familial nest and now live unloved and hungry: Nicholas Nickleby, forced to drink watered-down milk by his schoolmaster, Oliver Twist daring to ask the workhouse beadle for more.This disintegration of Dickens’s early family became a psychic wound that he felt compelled to heal again and again. Hence the continual, one might say compulsive, need to assert his adult domestic happiness to both friends and strangers. Dinner parties chez Dickens amounted to a kind of theatrical performance. The curtain went up punctually – guests were typically asked to arrive for dinner “at ¼ before 7 o’clock” – and a minute’s lateness was greeted with a disproportionate coldness. The props too were a tad stagey, putting one in mind of the nouveau riche Veneerings from Our Mutual Friend: “everything about the Veneerings was spick and  new. All their furniture was new and “the surface smelt a little too much of the workshop and was a trifle sticky”. Even kindly Mrs Gaskell couldn’t help repeating a rumour she’d heard about the Dickenses’ dinner service being solid gold. It wasn’t, of course, but there were monograms on everything, including the fish slice, which struck some guests as a bit of an over-reach for the son of a bankrupt naval clerk.There was something oppressive, too, about the elaborate courtesy with which the guests were garnished. Besides each place-setting there was a nosegay for the ladies and a buttonhole for the men. There were “quantities of artificial flowers” (snide Jane Carlyle again) up and down the table, which was itself groaning with “overloaded desert! Pyramids of figs, raisins, oranges”. William Thackeray, yet to hit pay dirt with Vanity Fair and therefore feeling murderous about his literary rival’s sudden access to cash, couldn’t resist bitching to his mother about Mrs Dickens’s penchant for “pink satin” and her dandyish husband’s suspiciously ringleted hair. The couple, he reported gleefully on another occasion, were “abominably coarse” and “vulgar”.The particularly observant guest might have noticed other signs that something was amiss in the Dickenses’ strenuous performance of middle-class domestic bliss. According to the gender codes of the mid-19th century, married couples were expected to organise themselves around the principle of “separate spheres”. For the lady of the house that meant running her increasingly lavish home “like the Commander of an Army” (Mrs Beeton), supervising servants and ordering food. The master meanwhile busied himself earning enough money to pay the bills for all those curtains, carpets, housemaids and fish slices that were now considered bare necessities for anyone who aspired to a certain level of bourgeois gentility.But it didn’t work that way in the Dickens household. Documents, including some on display at Doughty Street, reveal that it was he, rather than Catherine, who ran the household. It is Mr, not Mrs, Dickens who frets about ordering a hamper from Fortnum \u0026amp Mason, who drools over a fine piece of venison at the butchers, who sacks a sulky cook. Rumours about Dickens’s control freakery, in particular his habit of compulsively rearranging the furniture, had long circulated around literary London. But this appropriation of an active housekeeping role struck observers as downright weird. Nathaniel Hawthorne wondered out loud about Dickens “making bargains at butchers and bakers, and doing, as far as he could, whatever pertained to an English wife”.All this might have been understandable had Catherine been a slapdash housekeeper or a terrible cook. But the evidence to hand suggests the exact opposite. In 1851 she pseudonymously published What Shall We Have for Dinner?, a highly useful and popular – four reprints followed quickly – set of meal plans that encompassed everything from a smart dinner for 20 to modest family suppers. Ten years before Mrs Beeton, Mrs Dickens was organising her Bills of Fare according to what was seasonal (for which read good, wholesome and cheap) and which combinations of food would cook best on an open range, a complicated piece of kit which required a precise choreography of pots, pans and naked flame. What Shall We Have for Dinner? was a manual for real housewives who had real budgets: showy spectaculars such as “Grenadine of Veal” and “Charlotte Russe” are balanced out with plenty of suet dumplings, raspberry jam sandwiches and endless mashed potato. The busy housewife, getting supper without the benefit of a professional cook at her elbow, would also be thankful for Mrs Dickens’s many suggestions for cold beef and lamb, not to mention the variety of ‘made dishes’ knocked up from yesterday’s left overs.Everything suggests that Charles Dickens was fully behind What Shall We Have for Dinner?, a rare surviving copy of which can be seen at Doughty Street. He wrote the pseudonymous introduction and arranged for the book to come out with his own publishers. So it is unnerving to discover that, behind such a ringing endorsement of domestic theology, Dickens was busy retreating from the whole confected caper. In his introduction he issues a warning that, if women don’t learn to be better housekeepers, they have only themselves to blame if their menfolk start spending evenings on the town and at their clubs. Which, it turns out, is exactly what he was doing himself. It was during the Doughty Street years that Dickens secured election to both the Garrick and the Athenaeum, gentlemen’s club for men who preferred a home-away-from-home rather than Home itself. Then, from the early 1850s, it was noticeable that Dickens was presiding over fewer dinner parties with Catherine, preferring instead to invite people to supper at his “gipsey tent” AKA the Covent Garden office of Household Words, the weekly magazine that he edited. Crates of champagne and claret were ordered in advance, and the food was sent in from the hotel around the corner. “I loathe domestic hearths, I yearn to be a vagabond!” he wrote to a friend in 1848, in what was supposed to be a joke but sounds like a cri de coeur.When the final marriage separation came, in 1858, Dickens was quick to put it about that the relationship had failed because Catherine was a bad housekeeper and even worse mother. To one friend he wrote of his wife and the children that she “has never attached one of them to herself, never played with them in their infancy, never attracted their confidence as they have grown older”. The fact that he had fallen in love with another woman and wanted to be free to embark on an affair was apparently neither here nor there. Instead, opprobrium was heaped on Catherine by the Dickens camp, led by Forster, who managed to imply, without quite saying, that Mrs Dickens’s increasingly large girth and what Dickens termed her “mental disorder” was the result not of 12 pregnancies and accompanying postnatal depression, but rather a failure to keep her appetites within bounds. Catherine’s enjoyment of food was used as a weapon against her for many years, with one influential literary biographer even attributing the “famous breach” partly to her being too fond of her own recipes and becoming, while still young, “mountainously fat”.So it should come as no surprise that A Christmas Carol, with its message about family cohesion, the forgiving of slights and, above all, the sacramental quality of a really plump turkey, is a text that everywhere strains with ambivalence. For one thing, there’s the obvious conundrum that a tale written to preach about the blighting effect of financial profit and loss on human relations was actually conceived as a money spinner. By the autumn of 1843 Dickens, who at 31 no longer counted as a boy wonder, was having to face the fact that his early commercial and critical success were over. In contrast to the great triumphs of Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby, his current novel, Martin Chuzzlewit, wasn’t selling. It even looked as if the Great Boz might be required to pay back some of his handsome advance to his publishers Chapman \u0026amp Hall. His home life wasn’t easy either. Catherine was expecting her fifth child, Dickens’s father, the Micawberish John Dickens, was sponging off his son, and the rent on the new family house at Devonshire Terrace was proving punitive.So Dickens made a shrewd, calculated attempt at writing what today we’d call a Christmas stocking filler. The publishing market had been changing its rhythms radically in recent years, with the festive period now emerging as the peak time to release new titles, partly as a consequence of the way that cheap print allowed ordinary working people to give books as presents. Dickens was also clear that he didn’t want to be in the position of having to split the profits with anyone, so he decided to publish at his own expense, bypassing Chapman \u0026amp Hall completely.We know how the story ends. Ebenezer Scrooge learns that relationships are not about paying the least you can get away with and shutting yourself up in the prison of your lonely heart until you crumble into dust. He learns to love, not in the romantic sense (there will be no Mrs Scrooge), but in the familial sense of giving away his affection to his estranged nephew and his impoverished clerk’s family, expecting nothing in return, and yet gaining everything in this new universe of feeling.But there is another story here, and we know how that one ends, too. Dickens may have conceived of A Christmas Carol as a quick and clear-sighted punt on the British public’s increasing hunger for novelty books, but that doesn’t mean that it didn’t work its own transformative magic on him as well. Forster reported that he “wept over it, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself to an extraordinary degree”. “He walked thinking of it fifteen and twenty miles about the black streets of London”, often at very late hours of the night. That year he kept Christmas with an extraordinary zest “such dinings, such dancings, such conjurings, such blind-man’s buffings, such theatre-goings, such kissing-out of old years and kissing-in of new ones, never took place in these parts before”. For one brief midwinter moment Dickens seemed to have healed his relationship with his traumatic past and a present that was beginning to show hairline fractures by plunging into warm Christmas cheer, a cheer that he worked hard to conjure into being. It couldn’t last of course, and it didn’t.• Food Glorious Food: Dinner with Dickens, curated by Pen Vogler, is at the Charles Dickens Museum, London WC1N, until 22 April.

Tablet magazine’s Yair Rosenberg called the book highlighted by Walker “an unhinged antisemitic conspiracy tract written by one of Britain’s most notorious antisemites”.In an interview with the paper pegged to the outrage over Walker’s recommendation of Icke, Pamela Paul, the editor of the New York Times Book Review, said that the interview had been conducted by email, and that the paper never condenses answers or questions contributors on their choices.“The people’s answers are a reflection of their opinions, tastes and judgment. As with any interview, their words tell us something about them. The intention for By the Book is to be a portrait of someone through his or her reading life. What people choose to read or not read and what books they find to be influential or meaningful say a lot about who they are,” she said. “We’ve also faced criticism when a writer only named white authors, or male authors. My response to that is the same as in this case: Does that answer tell you something about the subject? I think it does, and now readers know it because we’ve informed you.”Despite the reaction, Paul said she would not have done things differently. “If someone mentioned a favourite novel that we thought was terrible, we wouldn’t include a note saying, ‘Actually, that book is awful.’ Likewise, we would never add that a book is factually inaccurate, or that the author is a serial predator, or any kind of judgment on the work or the writer. We do not issue a verdict on people’s opinions,” she said. “If people espouse beliefs that anyone at The Times finds to be dangerous or immoral, it’s important for readers to be aware that they hold those beliefs. The public deserves to know. That’s news.”Writing on her website, Walker also responded to the backlash. “I find Icke’s work to be very important to humanity’s conversation, especially at this time. I do not believe he is antisemitic or anti-Jewish. I do believe he is brave enough to ask the questions others fear to ask, and to speak his own understanding of the truth wherever it might lead.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:“All human wisdom is contained in these two words: ‘wait’ and ‘hope’”Cheery news from jimitron5000, who is reading Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk:There are deaths (probably murder), heavy snow, melted snow, William Blake, a car with a name, a lot of moustachioed men, an outdoor dentist that uses booze as an anaesthetic and a main character is delightfully eccentric - calling people by qualities she sees in them rather than their name for example, and a whole lot more. All in all, thoroughly enjoyable thus far.Also looking on the bright side of life is Thomas75164 who is reading Thomas Hardy’s Far From The Madding Crowd:I am enjoying the visit to Hardy country again. Such a wonderfully evocative writer with the constant threat of doom lurking.American Tabloid by James Ellroy has given Tom Mooney a good going over:No one but Ellroy could pull this off. This is a takedown of the Kennedys. Of Jack and Bobby, and Joe too. An expose of the lurid collusion between the mob, the CIA, the FBI, the teamsters and the government. It’s 10 books of plot rammed into 600 frantic, bloody, filthy pages.It’s genius. But now I’m worn out and tired. I feel like I got a shakedown from Pete Bondurant. Until next time, Mr Ellroy.Reading A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution from 1891-1924 by Orlando Figes has been an “effort” for greenmill, but “worth it”:I now feel that I have a reasonable purchase both on the events and the historical context in which they occurred. The book, although not a recent publication, also goes some way to explaining how Russia got to be the way it is in 2018. Highly recommended.The Soviet state has also been occupying rgilyead, who has just finished Serhii Plotsky’s Chernobyl:A serious historian’s view of what lead up to, and what followed from, the nuclear power station catastrophe. What is clear is that the instinctive secrecy of the Soviet state not only contributed to the causes of the disaster but also alienated the people of Ukraine and Belarus who were worst affected. This had a direct bearing on the rise of nationalistic political movements and the break up of the Soviet Union. The book may have a serious subject but the writing style is easy to read and rather compelling.“Another rather splendid work”, The Great American Novel by Philip Roth, has impressed julian6:An exuberant ode to baseball - a pastime with mythic status in the States. As a dabbler in softball - baseball’s gentler handmaiden - I do have quite a close rapport with this. With a joking nod to Moby Dick, Roth presents a gallery of absurd narratives about an impossibly strange and inept baseball team - the Ruppert Mundys. A wild satire and a wild ride, Roth’s liberating transgressive brio is a stunning tonic for our pinch-faced times.Finally, ChronicExpat has a good tip for reading beside the fire this Christmas:A couple of days ago I read Dickens’s The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton. This is actually an excerpt from The Pickwick Papers but is included as a free-standing short story (13 pages) in the Penguin Classics edition of A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings. It struck me that this might be a brilliant thing for reading aloud – lots of opportunities for funny and scary voices, etc. I have no children, nieces, nephews or grandchildren upon which to test this hypothesis but if you do, it might be one to keep in mind for Christmas ghost story reading.Please report back if you do test it!If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

And the near-term outlook for growth has weakened.It also said that rising tensions for the world economy, amid a weakening outlook for global growth, had influenced its decision.It said that businesses were delaying their investment decisions and the outlook was “likely to remain weak” in the near term should parliament remain unable to break the deadlock.While saying that it would likely need to raise interest rates over the next three years to keep a lid on inflation should Brexit pass smoothly, the central bank warned that it stood ready to cut rates or raise the cost of borrowing to protect the economy in the event of a disorderly and damaging departure from the EU.The Bank had previously warned that crashing out of the EU without a deal next year could trigger an immediate recession worse than the 2008 financial crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12700db45469e106aab6b46b5154cad8d3bd1362/0_319_5815_3489/master/5815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=196e733440b95c11afb5d7d4389201c6","title":"the banks decision to hold interest rates was inevitable","story":"Rate rises are off the agenda due to Brexit uncertainty and mothballed investment By now, had things turned out differently, Theresa May would have secured the passage of her Brexit withdrawal bill through parliament and the UK would unquestionably be on course to leave the EU at the end of March.In those circumstances, the Bank of England would be taking a very different view of the prospects for the economy and a much more hawkish view about interest rates. There would have been a good chance that at the December meeting of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, at least one member would have voted for an immediate tightening of policy.The fact that May is still struggling to get enough MPs to sign up to her deal and that businesses are being forced to plan for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit meant it was inevitable that the MPC would leave borrowing costs unchanged this month.Forward-looking business surveys show Brexit uncertainty has increased since the Bank’s last quarterly inflation report in November. Investment has been mothballed and there are signs – notwithstanding upbeat official data for the high street in November – that retail spending is cooling. In those circumstances, rate rises are clearly off the agenda.But if one message from the MPC was that the short-term risks to the economy have increased, a second was that it won’t delay long in raising rates should those risks fail to materialise.By the time of its February meeting, the Bank will know whether Brexit will be smooth or not. If it is, the short-term result will be higher investment, higher employment, higher wages and higher interest rates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b4d7fa56bdec3ad6b0d3255018ae2c5d92461f/0_290_5643_3386/master/5643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ec898dca15f76210c9941013488abaa","title":"from autobahn anomaly to motorway marvel berlin roadside grandstands","story":"An ambitious and unusual renovation project plans to transform former racetrack grandstands overlooking a motorway by 2021Hamid Djadda is leaning out over the handrail on the stepped concrete grandstands of what was once one of the most famous raceways in Germany.Opened in 1921, it was a marvel of the burgeoning automotive age: two long straights, capped by a hairpin turn and a wide arc just before the finish line. On race days, up to 4,000 people watched daring racing car drivers pilot the latest advancements in auto engineering, breaking land speed records – or crashing to their deaths trying.After nearly a century hosting sporting events including motorcycle races and Formula One, the Automobil-Verkehrs und Übungsstraße (Automobile Traffic and Practice Road, or Avus) held its last race in 1998, and the concrete grandstands were left to slowly disintegrate.But 20 years later, the cars still zoom by: the racetrack is now part of the 115 autobahn in west Berlin, and for passing motorists the grandstands are a roadside head-turning oddity, fenced off, crumbling and covered in graffiti.“It’s a unique building worldwide,” Djadda says over the roaring traffic, “because you’re so close. Look!” He jabs his arm at a huge truck passing in the near lane. It’s almost near enough to touch. “You cannot just tear it down.”Nearly three years ago, Djadda bought this roadside anomaly – which is now a listed historical building – and with Hamburg architect Christoph Janiesch has devised an ambitious plan to revive the grandstands. Djadda wants to turn the decrepit hall and announcer’s box into a glass-walled event venue and bar overlooking the autobahn. Offices are to be built into the voids beneath, lit by a dozen skylights in the stands. These will double as large vitrines lining the structure’s 240-metre length, and will display vintage automobiles where the crowds once sat, like a high-speed drive-by museum of the history of the car.The finished building will be a motoring spectacle, but the construction of the project itself will be a lesson in ingenuity. Work began earlier this year with the removal of the rotting wooden roof, which Djadda plans to replace in the spring. Due to the grandstands’ proximity to traffic, construction is only allowed during certain short windows and completion is targeted for the racetrack’s centenary in 2021.Christoph Rauhut, director of the Berlin state conservation authority, welcomes the project. “These are difficult buildings to protect,” he says. “What is planned is not so much a massive intervention but really a rediscovery of the original quality of the building.”“It has a high symbolic value,” agrees Richard Vahrenkamp, a logistics expert who has written extensively about German transportation.Although Vahrenkamp is hopeful Djadda’s project will preserve this piece of autobahn history, he remains sceptical about the business model: “There’s so much traffic, it’s not really a nice place for events.”Plenty of people expressed doubts during the two years it took to secure building permits, says Djadda. “People warned me, of course. And some said ‘you’re completely crazy’. I’m not the typical real estate developer.” Born in Iran and raised in Hamburg, Djadda ran a crystal glass business in Thailand for two decades before returning to Germany, where he is involved in businesses ranging from marzipan confections to tin signs. Although he describes the grandstands’ purchase price as “not so much”, Djadda expects the renovation to cost between €5m and €7m (£4.5m-£6.3m).He says the passing traffic is precisely the site’s appeal: the grandstands naturally draw a lot of attention: “I see this much more as a marketing place. Don’t forget, there are 93,000 cars every day driving by.”Conceived in 1913, the Avus was a privately funded effort to support the German automobile industry. Progress stalled by the first world war, but building resumed in 1919 and the first race was held in September 1921. On days without races, it was used as a toll road: wealthy Berliners paid 10 Deutsche Marks for a quick route to their lakeside homes along what is considered to be Europe’s first controlled-access motorway.Vahrenkamp says the road was also used as a testing ground for new materials such as macadam, asphalt and concrete. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, lessons learned on the Avus guided the development of the national freeway network. “It was the example for autobahn planning and design,” Vahrenkamp says. Later integrated into the autobahn system, the Avus went on to host both races and regular vehicle traffic through the 1990s.The racetrack’s observation tower is now a truckstop restaurant.“For some people it is an important, historic place,” says employee Manuela Mattner as she points out black-and-white racing photos plastered on the tabletops. “It’s the first thing you see when you drive into Berlin.”Djadda is betting on the value of that unique location.“Right now, due to the regulations, I cannot put any advertisements here,” he says. “It would distract from the driving. But once you have autonomous cars, then I can put anything I want. Then it’s a huge value. In that world, I would use it for advertisement.”Whether that world materialises any time soon is an open question, but Djadda is confident the project will succeed: “This will be even more monumental, I think, once we have only self-driving cars.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af62b74a0b627b9896eed0421cfdf6d683a1c86a/0_217_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9aafd3ff4ea8637d164eb84834a850c","title":"government stupid labour brexit referendum jeremy corbyn","story":"This is Britain’s stupidest hour – the age of crass, world-beating idiocy. History might, rather politely, record it as “the parliament of stupids”. As it departs today, many will think: good riddance to them, and to our stupid, obstinate, pig-headed prime minister.The shock is that Wednesday’s uproar in the Commons was government-initiated pandemonium. The seasoned observer Paul Waugh, of HuffPost, called it, “more anarchy than I’ve ever seen in 20 years of sitting in the press gallery … in part orchestrated by the Tory whips”. The speaker rapidly lost control – and the attacks from the Tory frontbench turned on John Bercow, the one the Brexiters yearn to chase away. Stupid is the wrong word for deadly-dangerous behaviour from an out-of-control government.How dare they depart leaving Brexit in limbo – no vote, no idea what happens next. On The Today Programme on BBC Radio 4, the leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, blithely confirmed with great sanguinity that if there is no agreement then the legal position is that no-deal prevails. That’s a “managed no-deal”, she said, stupidly. Managing with the army on the streets, the NHS squandering millions on fridges for rationed medicines, some businesses stockpiling and most exporters simply despairing, while the border force and port authorities keep reminding the cabinet that there is no way to stop gridlock.Even households are told to prepare. That’s an open invitation to the sort of panic-buying Mrs Thatcher boasted of in the year of the three-day week, when she revealed to a magazine in 1974 that she had filled two larders with tins of ham, tongue and fish, and jars of fruit, jam, marmalade and coffee – plus five bags of sugar, in the middle of a panic-buying sugar shortage. When criticised, she called it, “simply prudent housekeeping”. The three-day week was another entirely homegrown, artificial, Tory-created national crisis, which, incidentally, brought down Edward Heath’s government. Such an emergency would bring down this one too. But the Tory Brextremists driving the cabinet to Cobra-level alarmism have passed beyond the stage of rational political calculation.The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt (yet another implausible leadership contender), reportedly told the cabinet her department should take control because it has experience in emergency provision. Get ready for air-dropped food parcels and water purification tablets, with soldiers guarding supermarket shelves from food riots. Only a dangerously stupid cabinet can have sat around seriously discussing their intention to create a national emergency.How stupid is Theresa May? I enjoyed John Crace’s four possibilities this week: she’s psychotically delusional, consumed with personal ambition (I doubt that one), a sleeper for a foreign power bent on destroying us – or totally incompetent.What Jeremy Corbyn muttered was unparliamentary: he should have quickly apologised and not worsened it with the unlikely explanation he said “stupid people” not “stupid woman”. But the brouhaha pumped up by the Tories was beyond stupid for its nakedly synthetic indignation about nothing much, an assault on the speaker and an orchestrated distraction from their Brexit disaster.But there is, alas, plenty of stupidity to go round. In those awesomely awful PMQ confrontations, Corbyn’s own stupid obduracy curiously mirrors May’s, as they both repeat their wooden mantras, both avoiding Brexit votes. They share the same rigidity and lack of agility.Corbyn still cleaves to the Len McCluskey opposition to a referendum a few days away from his entourage of McCluskey people may give Corbyn a chance to think again. Unlike John McDonnell, Corbyn seems not greatly influenced by the need to win elections.Well, that’s just a poll. But Kellner knows his stuff. Labour top brass should go away and rethink their deadlocked stasis on the most important question of a generation. Labour supporters everywhere are driven to distraction by their party’s failure to seize the initiative from this most dangerous government in living memory. The pretence that Labour can renegotiate Brexit was blown out of the water by the EU itself, unless a stop is put on the 29 March Article 50 deadline and another referendum called.If Labour comes back in January parroting the same empty, fixed phrases we hear daily from the shadow cabinet, it really will be as stupid as the notoriously stupid party nominally in power. But that’s far too mild an epithet for this destructive government. Add your own lexicon for lunacy and ill-intent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/271921377eae5a5f51b1a40f8ab848ed002d79cf/287_40_2885_1731/master/2885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a357389b26892bdadf1cf1e3aef895e1","title":"lewis hamilton stevenage slums","story":"Stevenage was not built for speed. With all the confidence of the government and the generation that won a war and created the welfare state and the NHS, those who planned the town resolved that traffic flow would be best managed not by traffic lights but roundabouts. There are close to two dozen of them, making directions from London to the house I grew up in quite straightforward: count six roundabouts off the A1 and then take the first right.So the idea that the town would produce the Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has always been amusing to me because every half a mile or so you have to stop and give way. Hamilton is Stevenage’s most famous son, which made his comments at the Sports Personality of the Year awards on Sunday all the more hurtful to some. Speaking live, Hamilton said: “It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums.”He immediately corrected himself. “Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.” But the offence was out there. Message boards lit up the mayor expressed her “disappointment” plans to name a new council complex the Lewis Hamilton Hub are now being questioned.There is a legitimate grievance here, even if it is blown out of proportion by social media. Stevenage rarely gets national, let alone international attention, and here is its most famous son disparaging it, if only for a moment.The next day Hamilton said sorry on Instagram. The mayor accepted his “gracious apology”. Here’s hoping that moment has now passed. In an era when the mic is always on, someone is always recording and everyone can publish and distribute, everyone should have the space to misspeak, be corrected, apologise and move on. Everyone must take responsibility for what they say but no one should be defined solely on the basis of an unscripted comment. There is a lack of generosity when it comes to gaffes that denies human fallibility, the capacity for iniduals to grow and for us all to learn something.And in this moment when our political class is paralysed by its own fecklessness, homelessness is growing, one in five patients waits two weeks to see their GP, and disabled people are having their benefits cut, there’s a lot we can learn from my home town. Because there are no slums in Stevenage. Indeed, that was the point. It was created in 1946 by a government that did not see its purpose as merely survival but as a transformative agent to radically improve ordinary people’s lives. Responding to a housing crisis brought about by the war in particular and inequality in general, it built a town almost entirely of council houses. It was ambitious. “Stevenage will in a short time become world-famous,” said Lewis Silkin, the minister for town and country planning, in 1946. “People from all over the world will come to Stevenage to see how we, here in this country, are building for the new way of life.”They didn’t. And there is a concrete functionality to the town, roundabouts and all, that many would not have liked if they did. I always felt jealous, as a child, of those who grew up around the natural beauty of the Lake District, the West Country or the Cotswolds (we didn’t have a car, so the charm of some of the nearby villages mostly passed me by) and those who felt a strong sense of attachment to where they lived, whether it was beautiful or not. Stevenage was new. Most of my friends’ parents, like my own, did not come from there. We couldn’t really draw on a local identity because we were busy creating one.This had some benefits. There was no shortage of racism in Stevenage. But the town simply hadn’t been around long enough for that racism to embed itself institutionally, which is one of the two main reasons why I think it has produced so many successful black people, of whom Hamilton is just one.Stevenage was also home to the Manchester United and England footballer Ashley Young and the actor Giles Terera, Olivier award winner this year for best actor in a musical for his performance in Hamilton (no relation). It has also had two black mayors and this year saw a black woman appointed to chief inspector of police. This would be pretty impressive in any town of 88,000, but the black community in Stevenage is small enough that we’re mostly talking about one degree of separation. Young went to the same school and was in the same year as Hamilton, whose dad often used to chat with my brother as they commuted to London about how his son was getting on with his go-karting. My brother babysat for Terera, who was godson to my mother, who knew the second black mayor’s parents well and has an award named after her and the first black mayor.But the other reason is government. There were no no-go areas. No community, categorised by race, place or religion, had been written off. There was poverty but there were no slums. There was little to nothing you could assume about anyone from where they lived. There were no sink estates. The schools were good. It was a working-class town where people could find work. The young could get apprenticeships the old had liveable pensions.If you were young enough or earned little enough you could do college courses for free – as my whole family did. It was integrated in the proper sense of the word. Among the 14 or so families who lived on our row there was a policeman, a dinner lady, a contractor, a couple of painters and decorators, a couple of pensioners and an unemployed couple. Government made that possible.Of course, if you take government away from a place that owes its existence to government, that will have an effect. Thatcherism was rooted in the notion that there is no such thing as society Stevenage was founded on the opposite. Over time the underfunding of local councils, the loosening of planning regulations and austerity have taken their toll. When they simultaneously prevented councils from building council houses and allowed people to buy out the council stock, things changed. Stevenage is not the place it was. Few places are.But in the week that a homeless man was found dead near the Houses of Parliament, it’s important to realise both government’s role and potential, and that those basic social advances we have won can also be lost. Stevenage has no slums. Let’s keep it that way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e6376285d44114ba754ed6162f70d3db0364fa/24_0_3204_1923/master/3204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dfe98a4d81bed671b977cc7a05ce387","title":"parliament mps john bercow commons brexit","story":"It is a superbly theatrical tableau of passion. As MPs harangue the Speaker during this week’s row in the House of Commons over what Jeremy Corbyn did or didn’t say about Theresa May, their gestures and facial expressions are so eloquent and contrived it is hard to believe the picture wasn’t elaborately staged by some great history painter. That is because everyone in this photograph is fluent in a language of gesture and facial expression that goes back to ancient Roman oratory, and was used by artists including Titian, Caravaggio and David to communicate heightened drama.Let’s start with the hands. They are displayed with a studied and effective eloquence. At the far left a cupped palm facing upwards emerges from a jacket sleeve much as it might have done, 2,000 years ago, from a Roman senator’s toga. Meanwhile two hands in the middle of the scene are presented in a formal act of supplication. John Bercow himself uses his hands to suggest both strength and consideration of the plea: he makes a fist towards the crowd while at the same time holding out the fingers of his left hand as if counting off points in an argument.The faces are equally on-message. We see, from left to right, a head hung pessimistically as if to say there’s no point in asking for justice: an incredulous near-smile a half-ironic look of solicitation and a world-weary smirk. One mouth hangs open in dumbstruck wonder.So this is what they call a great parliamentary moment. The reason this frozen tableau of high feeling looks like a figurative painting is that these MPs are practiced rhetoricians. Or to put it another way, bloody good actors. For anyone taking a purely partisan line, that might be case closed. Here are Tory MPs caught using the classical rhetorical debating style they learned at public school to create a contrived fracas.But it’s stranger than that, and worse than that. What we see here is a 400-year history of parliamentary democracy trying to ignore the brick wall it’s heading for. Terrified by the impotence conferred on it by an EU referendum that’s smashed the very idea of representative government and replaced it with the blunt rule of plebiscite, the House of Commons retreats in this scene into its own forms, rituals, atmosphere. Look at the wood, the leather. These stagey perfomers are not just trying to catch Corbyn out. They are trying to pretend the Commons is still the stage where British history is made. Think of the legendary moments of parliamentary drama that fill history books and films, from Charles I bringing troops into the House to try and arrest his critics to Pitt the Elder’s seizure in the chamber to Arthur Greenwood speaking for England in 1939. Is this where it all ends – not with a bang but with an argument about a whisper?All the sense of history, all the decorous debating skill of parliament are on display – but it’s so trivial and tiny compared with the realities that need to be addressed. Not because a potential misogynist slur against the prime minister doesn’t matter, or is somehow OK if it was uttered by a socialist against a Tory. But because the hour is truly desperate, and with the executive staggering towards a no-deal Brexit, the Commons appears in this photograph to find its own theatricality more interesting than seeking a way out of the nation’s terrifying impasse.This picture shows what we love and hate about parliament – its aura of history. To anyone who’s considered that long history, things are now looking scary. The scale of our crisis, with Brexit theatening to consume the very way we govern ourselves, resembles the kind of breakdown last seen in the 17th-century civil war. If MPs can’t solve this, their fate may be sealed. They will be locked up in their chamber to have their meaningless impassioned arguments while the country move on – to what? A citizen’s assembly, say optimists. But it’s hard to see how the destruction, by plebiscite, of the world’s most enduring representative system is somehow going to result in a new dawn for democracy. This picture shows us MPs fiddling while British democracy burns.• Jonathan Jones writes on art for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d333868df3256845f50b6fd7139bb3202537d4ca/0_209_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf2b2c5d7923c18358eddf2d0ac327e2","title":"polls stay eu yougov brexit peoples vote","story":"With deadlock in Westminster over how to move forward with Brexit, what are the polls saying about people’s changing attitudes towards leaving the EU?

A foreign ministry official confirmed “all options are on the table but nothing formal has been decided yet”.Conservation campaigners welcomed the possible end to whaling in the Southern Ocean but warned that by withdrawing from the IWC, Japan risked becoming a “pirate whaling nation”.“We would like to wholeheartedly celebrate an end to Japan’s whaling in the Southern Ocean, but if Japan leaves the International Whaling Commission and continues killing whales in the north Pacific it will be operating completely outside the bounds of international law,” said Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns at Humane Society International in Australia.“This is the path of a pirate whaling nation, with a troubling disregard for international rule.”Darren Kindleysides, chief executive of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said: “Leaving the IWC would set a very dangerous precedent for other international treaties and conventions. Not satisfied with harpooning whales, it now looks like Japan is threatening to harpoon the future of the IWC.“The IWC has become the driving force for global whale conservation efforts in the 21st century. If Japan is serious about the future of the world’s whales, they would not leave the IWC.”Japan has previously threatened to quit the IWC, arguing that the moratorium was supposed to be a temporary measure and accusing the IWC of abandoning its original purpose – managing the sustainable use of global whale stocks.Japanese officials claim that populations of certain types of whale – such as the minke – have recovered sufficiently to allow the resumption of “sustainable” hunting.At September’s IWC meeting in Florianópolis, Brazil, anti-whaling nations led by Australia, the European Union and the US voted down a Japanese proposal to change the decision-making process – a move that would have made it easier for Japan to secure enough votes to end the commercial whaling ban.The defeat prompted Japan’s IWC commissioner, Joji Morishita, to warn that the country’s differences with anti-whaling nations were “very clear” and that it would plan its “next step”.Japan has been able to use a clause in the IWC moratorium allowing it to conduct “research” hunts every year and to sell whale meat on the open market, although consumption has plummeted in recent decades.Japan faced criticism earlier this year after reporting that its whaling fleet had killed 122 pregnant whales during its annual research hunt in the Southern Ocean last winter. Of the 333 minke whales caught during the four-month expedition, 181 were female – including 53 juveniles.In 2014, the international court of justice ordered Japan to halt its annual hunts in the Southern Ocean after concluding that they were not, as Japanese officials had claimed, conducted for scientific research.But Japan resumed whaling in the region two years later under a revamped programme that included reducing its catch quota by about two-thirds.Japan would join Iceland and Norway in openly defying the ban on commercial whale hunting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af12ce7f2fb3db229b6d8e827de714683ac1030d/0_0_3903_2341/master/3903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22be9f0198a811eb39f5cf5d105f25e","title":"leave no traces thomasin mckenzie the bees have left the deepest mark on me","story":"The young star of Leave No Trace (one of the ’s top-ranked films of the year) talks about the survival skills she learned for the role – and her passion for the wildYou filmed Leave No Trace early in 2017 and it has been nearly a year since it was in festivals. Does it feel like another world ago?It does, partly because I have shot four other films since then and they have each taken me into very different cultures, time-zones and experiences. But my actual life has quite a lot in common with the life of Tom in Leave No Trace. I have a forest right next to my house and I go there a lot with my dog – though in New Zealand we call it the bush. And I have continued my passion for bees back home. They need a lot of help worldwide right now. I guess Leave No Trace planted a lot of seeds in my life that I want to continue, so yes, it is always with me and always will be.You spend quite a lot of the film getting rained on in freezing cold forests. Was it as challenging to shoot as it looked?Did you learn real-life survival skills to prepare for the film?The survivalist lifestyle comes so naturally to your character Tom. How do you think you would fare in her shoes?Pretty good, I think! I mean, we learned those skills for real. I can build a fire, I can farrow sticks – that’s my favourite skill we learned. I can collect fresh rainwater, identify plants to eat and use for medicine, navigate a path. I have a sense of adventure. Some of these things come naturally because I am from New Zealand and I have spent a lot of time in the bush, but Leave No Trace has certainly lifted my life-skills for ever.Do you see an attraction to the off-grid life of Will and Tom?Where I come from it is not so unusual to live like Will and Tom. Maybe not quite so intensely as they do … but being able to spend time in the bush and by the sea and to live simply, away from the internet, climbing trees, reading books and eating plainly, these things are what me and my friends aspire to do in our summer at Christmas-time and through new year. I am vegan so I live pretty simply and mindfully anyway. You are from a family of actors and screenwriters. Did you always see yourself entering the business?No, I hated acting when I was a kid, even though I did it sometimes. It was a part-time job that enabled me to buy Bratz dolls and stuff. It was relentless in my family. My parents, my three siblings, are all actors, writers, directors – even my 91-year-old grandmother is an actress who is still working. She and I share an apartment downstairs, away from everyone else in the family. Acting, acting, acting – it was the last thing I wanted to do. But when I was 13, I played a real-life person called Louise Nicholas in a film called Consent and I realised that acting is a pathway to be able to tell a story that will make a difference. Louise is still a mentor and friend for me.One of the film’s most memorable scenes sees you handling a hive of honeybees with your bare hands. How scary was it?Not so much scary as amazing … I think the bees are what have left the deepest mark on me from Leave No Trace. Standing there in front of the hive and feeling the warmth and hearing the noise of that hive was a deep experience for me. These little creatures had the power to band together and kill me if they decided to. I just had to trust them as they settled on my bare hands, and be open to their power. Watching them work together in such an intricate pattern was profound. Actually – it was a lot like watching a really great film crew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857a48a293994c05d2919fab066924cc32c4c3b3/0_145_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10e19845f3cf64a61e35d9fbc38bd116","title":"steve mcqueen i experience racism every day","story":"The director’s Widows is the ’s eighth best film of the year. He explains why some male white critics didn’t really get itYou first watched Lynda La Plante’s ITV series Widows as a 13-year-old in 1983. Do you think it’s harder for people to overcome stereotypes – as the women in the series and your film do – in Brexit Britain than in Thatcher’s Britain?No. Nothing much has changed at all. I don’t know what has happened but we have taken two steps backwards. Nationalism absolutely has a part to play. The day after Brexit, my mother went to her favourite high-street shop. She had a new credit card with her and was struggling to remember the pin. The guy behind the till said: “It’s four digits in this country.” My daughter was with her at the time and said: “Granny, why didn’t you say anything?” She replied: “When they go low, we go high.” But the day before Brexit you wouldn’t have even thought about saying that. Apparently, you’re allowed to now.Have you personally experienced more racism since Brexit?Every day, mate. Yes, of course! Wolves come in sheep’s clothing. You deal with it. You have to or you go mad. So long as you put one foot in front of the other, you’re good.You’ve spoken about how audiences watching Widows seem to welcome the chance for some catharsis that they seem paralysed in the current political situation. How can they seize agency?We really do have the power. As iniduals we don’t, but as a collective, absolutely we do. We can change the course of events. Sometimes we just need a reminder – and cinema is one of those tools that can actually do that.Do you think Widows is getting the acclaim it deserves?I don’t know. I don’t expect it anyway. If it comes: fantastic. If it doesn’t: whatever. It is what it is.You’ve said you think it might be being misunderstood by some male film critics …It depends if you’re sensitive enough to understand what other people go through, if you’re a male white critic. It’s one of those things that’s kind of obvious to me, maybe not to others.A friend of my wife said to her husband: “Let’s go see Widows.” And he said: ‘Oh, is it only women who are starring in it?” And she said: “It’s got Liam Neeson.” And he said: “Oh, OK, I’ll go then.” So we’re still fighting against nonsense. I mean, how often, as a woman, did you project yourself on to heroes such as John Wayne or Sean Connery? That men struggle to even think about doing that is incredible.Is a lot of the conversation about progress hot air?Look, if I were brought up differently I would think differently. It’s about putting these debates into the mainstream and then being absolutely open and honest. Truth will always prevail – if I didn’t believe that, I wouldn’t be on the phone to you now. And that’s why we need good journalism rather than journalism that’s only for certain people. I went to CNN the other day, I looked around the desk: where were all the black people? If a scientist were trying to carry out a fair and logical experiment, they wouldn’t just use a part of the population. The conclusions would be quasi. You have to take on all possibilities and then come to a conclusion, and that’s the only way we can have a logical debate. How anyone would think we could have that without everything on the table seems impossible – but we do so gladly. Because the people with positions of influence do that.The Hollywood Foreign Press Association – which runs the Golden Globes – completely ignored Widows in its nominations. Does that speak to you of a certain blindness?Well, yes. As an artist you have your path and that’s fine. And sometimes the world won’t agree with you and that’s fine. I’m here hopefully for a little while and will do my work. I’m just telling a story about four women trying to get their shit together, about the environment in which we’re living, in a way that’s not high heels and handbags, that’s about human beings and full-on conversations.Yet I can’t remember if there has ever been a movie about a gay person who is a detective or the lead in a romantic comedy who doesn’t have a problem with their sexuality. How is that possible? Certain people of power and influence in the industry are gay yet would never think about making a movie like that. What does it say about the worldview they’re helping maintain? I’m not pointing fingers – I’m just saying that if we see two men or women walking down the street holding hands, we’re not even gonna blink. But if it’s on the screen, apparently it becomes thunderous.Was the Academy overeager to demonstrate their racial inclusivity by picking Kevin Hart to host – and ignoring his record of homophobia?Well, that’s all to do with popularity and their needing viewing figures. But obviously someone made a mistake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed1f2436af16700fdecec735c38d344503a57c3/62_256_2573_1544/master/2573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9592c38298a06690c17372473fe61b8","title":"week in geek best sci fi fantasy films 2018","story":"Sony led the way with a spectacular Spider-Man caper, while the terrifying Annihilation reimagined alien invasion and Avengers: Infinity War delivered a shock to rock the cosmosThere has never been a better time to be a fan of comic-book movies. Marvel seems to be incapable of putting a foot wrong – three of its movies make this list – while there are undoubted signs of life at 20th Century Fox, Sony and DC, whose Aquaman narrowly failed to make my Top 10.There are also encouraging indications that mainstream science fiction is slowly veering away from the meat-headed bombast of the Michael Bay Transformers movies. Animated fantasies have rarely reached such heights of quality, with Aardman’s Early Man and Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs also narrowly missing out on making this list. Apologies, too, to the excellent Paddington 2, Upgrade and Teen Titans Go! to the Movies. So here are Week in geek’s Top 10 films of 2018.At last, a modern superhero movie that broke the Marvel mould and gave us something fresh and innovative. Sony has struggled to convince critics its darker Spidey-themed spin-offs, namely the undercooked Venom, can cut the mustard, so why not offer us an alternative animated take on comic-book razzmatazz? Into the Spider-verse duly doubled down on elastic, far-out visuals and madcap sci-fi tomfoolery to ensure the new wall-crawler (Miles Morales) swung straight to the top of the Spider podium on his debut outing.If Black Panther had been brought to the big screen in any other era, it might have been a mess. The concept of an African society that blends technological superiority over any other culture on Earth with adherence to traditional tribal customs was so thrillingly out there that it is hard to imagine previous generations of film-makers doing it justice, at least without descending into blaxploitation excess. Marvel and director Ryan Coogler’s attention to detail when depicting the vivacious and fearsome nation of Wakanda, plus a bravura storyline that pitted the country against both its own offspring and the worst miscreants of the west, made this a joyous, deeply human story. That Coogler’s film represented a rare opportunity to present a mostly black cast in a tentpole feature just made the experience all the more splendid.After imagining the downfall of mankind in his previous movie Ex Machina, Alex Garland once again delighted in feeding humanity to nefarious forces. This time, the terrifying “Shimmer” represented a very different kind of unstoppable force, a seemingly unconscious entity – reminiscent of the extraterrestrial presence encountered in John Carpenter’s The Thing – that warps, rips and splices living creatures like a god-like toddler with a set of Plasticine mannikins. An irresistible phantasmagorical horrorshow that confirmed Garland as modern sci-fi’s most singular British auteur.Marvel spent more than a decade getting to the point where Thanos made his climactic finger click. We all knew it had to happen, yet this was still one of the biggest shocks ever seen in mainstream cinema. Household names – Spider-Man, Black Panther, most of the s of the Galaxy – snuffed out in a millisecond, as well as half the intelligent creatures of the Marvel universe. This was the kind of moment only ever seen before in the comics, one almost impossible to imagine happening on the big screen. Yet there it was. It happened. And the MCU may end up being all the better for it.Just as loopy and off-the-wall as the first entry, David Leitch’s zippy comic-book satire made capital this time around by royally ripping the mickey out of superhero ensembles, namely the hilariously short-lived X-Force. Ryan Reynolds’ potty-mouthed antihero retains a love-hate relationship with his audience – at one moment eliciting sympathy courtesy of the horrible life he’s been subjected to, the next behaving like such a bozo that we take pleasure in watching him get battered to within an inch of his mutant life. The whole point of Deadpool is that it’s perfectly acceptable, and supremely enjoyable, to adopt both positions.Proof that even a puny franchise can be pumped up to giant size with a little bit of love. The first Ant-Man was hampered by the late arrival on the scene of director Peyton Reed, as well as by Marvel’s decision to allow star Paul Rudd and Adam McKay to rewrite the original Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish script in a matter of weeks. This time around, the Marvel stamp of quality was far more apparent, as Reed delved into the spectacular psychedelic underbelly of Ant-Man’s quantum realm.The original Wreck-It Ralph is underrated, and, frankly, it was about time for a sequel. If Ralph Breaks the Internet didn’t quite match its predecessor for sheer 8-bit fun, it did revive one of the most impressive double acts of the last few decades, in the shape of John C Reilly’s lovable ham-fisted video-game oaf and Sarah Silverman’s delightful candy-cane racer Vanellope von Schweetz. The scene in which Vanellope meets the Disney princesses and teaches them how to cut loose is a masterpiece of self-reflexive satire that shows how much the once-prissy Mouse House has changed.Goodbye vacuous bloke-movie in which mammoth robots repeatedly smash each other about their metal faces whenever the camera lens isn’t glued to Megan Fox’s bottom. Hello smart coming-of-age, girl-and-her-robot tale in the vein of Big Hero Six or The Iron Giant. Thank Optimus Prime himself that somebody chose to depose Michael Bay from his throne and hand the Transformers keys to Travis Knight, director of Kubo and the Two Strings. Long may he remain at the steering wheel.Steven Spielberg’s virtual-reality extravaganza lacked the grimy cyberpunk majesty of The Matrix and other predecessors, a legacy of the pop culture-heavy slant of Ernest Cline’s source novel. But, despite resembling a bright and breezy gamer theme park rather than the spiky culture shock imagined by William Gibson or Bruce Sterling, this was a genuinely enticing digital wonderland. A well-chosen cast and Spielberg’s knack for sharp and exuberant storytelling made Ready Player One worthy of its very own high score.A long-awaited sequel that prompted the question why haven’t The Incredibles had more big screen adventures over the past decade. This time around it was Holly Hunter’s Elastigirl thrust front and centre, with Craig T Nelson’s Mr Incredible left to look after the kids in a neat spin on shifting gender roles. Brad Bird’s return as the wonderful superhero fashionista Edna Mode was worth the price of admission alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/615e7fd5a246eebb97a72990e5e41c0422677380/686_208_3091_1855/master/3091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe77bb3c6f86f9c089903612962bcbb0","title":"danny rose spurs carabao cup arsenal karma","story":"Danny Rose believes Tottenham’s Carabao Cup win at the Emirates delivered some “karma” in response to the way Arsenal celebrated their 4-2 Premier League victory over Spurs earlier in the month.“We had the motivation of getting to the semi-final but the cherry on top was silencing them,” the defender said. “Just remembering, they won a game at the beginning of December and they’re celebrating like they won the league. We’re over the moon we’ve put that result right. We’ll see where they are come the end of the season and we’ll see where we are.“We were fully relishing the opportunity. Our only motivation was remembering the nonsense that Arsenal posted after the game a few weeks ago. That was our motivation. Players that have only played 10 games for Arsenal were getting ahead of themselves. We used that in a positive way.Karma is a … it’s a … you know. They fully deserve what they got, Arsenal.”At the same moment Rose was outlining his opinion in the game’s aftermath, his teammates Dele Alli, who was keen to point out the score after being struck on the head with a bottle, and Harry Kane were posting celebratory tweets on social media. The irony was lost in this case, but in the heat of derby emotion being one eyed is an entirely reasonable part of any local rivalry.Rose feels particularly energised to be part of it all after a period on the fringes at Tottenham, suffering a serious knee injury and a period of depression. Having worked his way back into the team playing every minute of a week that included Champions League qualification at Camp Nou, a last minute Premier League win and a derby cup match emphasises a new lease of life at his club. He credits a couple of long conversations and some hard messaging from Mauricio Pochettino with the turnaround. “After the World Cup, I called the manager. We spoke for an hour before the first game of the season at Newcastle and we spoke for an hour after that. We spoke for quite a long time and the one main thing that stuck out from what he said to me was: ‘Danny – stop wasting time’. So I’m not wasting any more time. I’ve got my head down again. I’m trying to get back to where I was a couple of years ago.”The manager’s words struck a chord. “Be fully focused. On here. And if you’re not fully focused then you’re free to leave the club,” explains Rose. “So I told him that I am fully focused. And I’m going to be here to fight and help the club progress.”There was no evidence of any distraction in Tottenham’s camp concerning speculation about their manager being a prime target for the Manchester United job full time as squad and staff looked unified on their immediate targets. Rose is hopeful that the Carabao Cup can bring silverware. The League Cup win of 2008 is their only trophy in 20 seasons.“Winning any trophy would be special for all of us,” he says. “The majority of us have been together for the last four or five years. It’s been a long journey and to win a trophy together would be amazing, something we all deserve considering how much we have worked and we’ve stuck together.”Tottenham face Chelsea, another derby, in the semi-finals."},{"url":null,"title":"the 100 best male footballers in the world 2018 nos 100 71","story":"Our panel of 225 experts from 69 nations compile a list of the greatest male players in 2018.

Never fear – here is our guide to the best new board gamesThis family-friendly game of rival archaeologists sees players racing to explore an ancient Egyptian tomb, uncovering priceless artefacts as they make their way along a twisting underground passage. At first glance it resembles roll-and-move games such as Monopoly or Ludo. But where those traditional family favourites rely heavily on luck, Luxor is more tactical. It uses clever card play to determine how you progress along its subterranean track, emphasising smart decisions rather than chance.As you delve deeper into the tomb you will discover an assortment of treasures that boost your score and gain new, more powerful cards that let you carve out advantages over your opponents. It is an addictive blend of fast and thoughtful gameplay and, while its grave-robbing theme may not be culturally sensitive, it is quick, elegant and accessible – an ideal option for anyone dipping their toes into modern board games for the first time.For many families, a post-turkey game of charades is a Christmas staple, and the festive season would not feel quite complete without watching uncle Fred turning purple with rage while trying to mime “The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe”. This team-based game of clever communication aims to create the same kind of feel, but rather than making you wildly gesticulate, it challenges you to convey messages to your teammates using a vocabulary of just 105 words printed on cards.This turns out to be trickier than you might think. You could end up expressing “Super Mario” as: “Play with red blue jump man,” or “hedgehog” as: “Small brown not fast animal.” With such a small pool of words at your disposal, you will have to be creative to get your meaning across, and if it is difficult for the player coming up with the message, it is just as tough for the other members of their team trying to decipher it.With both sides simultaneously attempting to guess the same word, there is real competitive tension. And if you are playing with kids, the game comes with a selection of difficulty levels, letting you tailor its setup to players of all ages.This deceptively simple game casts players as the leaders of Polynesian tribes vying to explore and settle a cluster of tropical islands. On each turn you will place one of your tribespeople on the board, claiming areas of land and water. The aim is to spread your people as widely as you can across the map, but also to control the islands by having more members of your tribe on them than your opponents. Along the way, you will also boost your score by picking up resources such as bamboo and coconuts.With multiple ways to earn points, you will face some tricky decisions as you try to work out the best ways to place your people. And even once you have come up with a plan, you will need to seize vital sections of the board before your rivals. The result is that, in spite of its sunny artwork and idyllic island theme, Blue Lagoon reveals a brutal competitive streak as you cut your opponents off from the territories they most need.It is enough to spark some intense grudges, and it is impressive just how much antagonism and strategy the game squeezes out of some very straightforward rules.Troll \u0026amp Dragon, a child-friendly game of courageous treasure hunters, sees players sneaking through caverns guarded by ferocious monsters, helping themselves to as much loot as they can carry in the process. Each turn starts by rolling and re-rolling dice in an effort to accumulate diamonds. But each time you do it, you risk attracting the attention of an angry troll, dropping your treasure as you flee.From there you will move on to a dragon’s cave, where things become more heated. Once again you will roll dice, this time aiming to grab precious golden nuggets. But as you do, your opponents will also roll a set of red dragon dice, attempting to wake the slumbering beast and chase you off empty-handed.The result is a fast-paced and frantic scramble. To escape with your ill-gotten goodies you will have to judge when to push your luck and when to turn and run. It takes some quick-thinking analysis of risks and rewards, and watching young players trying to find that balance can be hilarious, making for riotous fun for grown ups as well as kids.The first thing that strikes you about this game of strange contraptions and eccentric engineers is the giant cardboard structure it deposits in the middle of your table. It is a container full of coloured marbles with a chute-like mechanism that lets them slide out as you play, and it looks a bit like something Wile E Coyote might order from the Acme Corporation.Look beyond this physical gimmick, though, and you will find a slick and streamlined game about inventors trying to claim the top prize in a prestigious science fair. You will battle to build machines that impress the judges, harvesting different types of energy – represented by those shiny marbles – and spending it to add new components to your growing creation. You will unlock new abilities, generate extra power and make ever-more dramatic plays as you fight to establish your scientific supremacy.There is a powerful sense of progression as you incrementally augment your machine, and it is deeply satisfying seeing its parts starting to work together. But with players taking just a single action on each of their turns, it never gets bogged down in complexity, and as soon as one game is over, you will be itching to start another.Keyforge: Call of the Archons2 players, 30-45 minutes, from £8.99In 1993, the designer Richard Garfield released Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game that cast players as powerful mages doing battle in a fantasy universe. It became a smash hit, with players building collections of cards and using them to create custom decks, all fine-tuned for different strategies. But it also led to the growth of a secondary market, with powerful cards sometimes changing hands for hundreds of pounds online.Garfield’s latest game aims to side-step this collector mania. Like Magic, Keyforge sees players command armies of beasts and warriors in card-based conflict. But rather than building your own deck, you will buy a pre-constructed one assembled by a computer algorithm.It is a novel approach, and it makes Keyforge much cheaper to get into than other card battlers. But it is also a fascinating game in its own right, with plenty of interesting tactical decisions and clever card combinations to discover. The game goes out of its way to ensure you have something interesting to do on almost every turn, and contests swing back and forth as players deploy their troops, clash in combat and exploit an array of special powers and abilities. It makes for some dramatic and unpredictable moments as the fight for supremacy plays out on your kitchen table.Miniature battle games have a reputation for complexity. But Wildlands, a fantasy skirmish game that sees players command squads of warriors in fast and furious combat, aims to make things quicker, simpler and infinitely more approachable.It hands players command of an assortment of sword fighters, archers and magically-powered automatons, throwing them into a frantic struggle for survival. The aim is to outsmart and overpower your opponents, gaining points for killing off enemy troops and collecting magic crystals scattered around the board.In the process, you will come up with clever plans and react to your rivals’ plays, picking off your foes with well-placed crossbow bolts or charging headlong into hand-to-hand combat. The result is a game full of twists, turns and dramatic moments, where lone soldiers put up heroic last stands against multiple assailants, fleet-footed rogues e out of the path of volleys of arrows, and grizzled sorcerers lob fireballs at one another across darkened corridors.What is most impressive is that Wildlands conjures so much action and drama with so little mechanical clunkiness. Everything in the game revolves around simple sets of symbols on cards, and it combines real tactical depth with pick-up-and-play simplicity. It also comes with four different factions to command, and a double-sided board giving you either a ruined city or a subterranean dungeon to battle over, ensuring your clashes have plenty of variety.Have you played any great games this year?

He also said that Putin’s support for the current Brexit deal strengthened the case for a rethink. In a comment released by the People’s Vote campaign, which is calling for a second referendum, Miliband said:Vladimir Putin’s contempt for, or fear of, a people’s vote will not shock anybody. The overwhelming evidence of malign and multiple Russian interventions in western democratic processes, including the Brexit referendum, have been designed to destabilise democratic rule. It is an insult to the United Kingdom that he should be lecturing us on our democratic process.The idea that democratic consent for Brexit policy should end on 23 June 2016 is dangerous. Theresa May’s plan satisfies no one and was not the basis of the leave campaign. It would be prudent reinforcement of democratic principles to revisit democratic support before it is implemented. Russian support for a bad deal alongside British government threats of no deal should be taken as strong evidence that a different option is needed. I’ll be wrapping up the blog in about an hour so so. And then I’m not expecting to be blogging again until Monday 7 January, when the Commons returns after the Christmas recess.A colleague may be running a blog tomorrow, although at this stage I’m not sure and it may depend on what’s around. But then over the holiday period we’ll be off air, unless a very big political story breaks.Before I sign off, I’d like just to wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year. And, to those of you who comment BTL, regularly or occasionally, thank you. The comments are a big part of what makes this blog interesting and I’m particularly grateful for the support, suggestions and advice I pick up down there. I find the constructive questions really helpful. And the critical ones tend to be thought-provoking and helpful too (as long as they are not rude). Unfortunately I don’t think there is an award for best news website comments section, but if there were, you lot would win hands down.Penny Mordaunt, who combines being minister for women and equalities with being international development secretary, told MPs this morning that she wants to abolish sexism in the honours system. She was responding to a question from Maria Miller, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, who says the way the honours system treats spouses is unfair.Miller was referring to the way wives get the courtesy title “lady” if their husbands are made a knight or a lord. But husbands and civil partners do not get recognised in the same way if their partners receive a damehood or a peerage.Mordaunt told Miller that she was making “an incredibly important point”. She went on:The Cabinet Office is doing great work to create more ersity in the honours list, but inequality is baked into the system, including in the use of courtesy titles. It is quite wrong that people are treated differently in this way, so I have written to the prime minister to ask that it is remedied.Mordaunt did not explain how she would like to see the anomaly removed. Six years ago a Tory MP proposed a bill under the 10-minute rule that would allow husbands and civil partners to receive “equivalent honorary titles to those available to women”.An alternative solution would be simply to abolish courtesy titles altogether, but that is unlikely to appeal to a Conservative prime minister. Many Tory backbenchers end up receiving knighthoods and for many, it is said, part of the appeal is that their wives become ladies.Here is Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, commenting on her amendment to the finance bill intended to stop the government implementing a no-deal Brexit without MPs’ consent. (See 2.51m.) She said:The risks to our economy and security from “no deal” are far too high and it would be irresponsible to allow it to happen. I do not believe parliament would support “no deal” and ministers should rule it out now. But if the government won’t rule it out, then parliament needs to find opportunities to stop the country reaching the cliff edge by accident - starting with the finance bill in the first week back, then looking at every other legislative opportunity too. That is why we have tabled this amendment with cross party support.The House of Lords is holding one of its intermittent elections while the vast majority of the upper house is appointed, the 92 hereditary peers who still work in it are voted in by other members.This byelection is caused by the death in October of Roger Bootle-Wilbraham, the seventh Baron Skelmersdale, who served as a junior minister in the Thatcher government.There are 16 hereditary peers seeking to replace him, with members of the Lords able to cast their votes (in the Queen’s robing) room on 22 January.As usual, the candidates, or rather most of them, have submitted brief campaign pitches for the official election notice. Two – Lords Cadman and Southampton – have not done so while another, Lord Biddulph, wrote pithily if cryptically only: “Always willing to serve”.Most of the others have experience much as you might expect, especially the Earl of Carnarvon, who talks up his “wide experience of small business, farming, tourism and countrysideheritage matters” - ie running a country estate, in this instance Highclere Castle, known to TV viewers as the set of Downton Abbey.There are exceptions, however: the current Lord Hampton, whose 19th century ancestor had the title created after he served as secretary of state for war and first lord of the Admiralty, says he is a secondary school teacher in Hackney, east London, who also coaches cricket at a local club.A cross-party group of MPs, including select committee chairs, has tabled an amendment to the finance bill designed to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. It says clause 89 of the finance bill would only be allowed to come into force if there was either a Brexit deal, or a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no deal Brexit.Clause 89 of the bill would give the government the power to keep tax law working in the event of a no deal Brexit.According to ITV’s Robert Peston, the amendment could be put to a vote on Tuesday 8 January, when MPs will debate the remaining stages of the finance bill.The amendment has been tabled by Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, and also signed by: Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former minister Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business committee Harriet Harman, the Labour chair of the joint committee on human rights and Nick Boles, the Conservative who this week threatened to resign the party whip and vote against the government in a confidence motion if it tried to implement a no-deal Brexit.Q: What will be on the agenda for Polish-UK cooperation after Brexit? And what will bind the two countries together?Morawiecki says he hopes a new trade agreement will be negotiated soon. The withdrawal agreement can lead to that, he says. As press conferences go, that was about as unilluminating as they come. Q: What has been discussed about the rights of Poles living in the UK?Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, says he has discussed this frequently with May.He says the withdrawal agreement is the best deal available. He says he hopes it is adopted.Q: If there is a no-deal Brexit, and chaos is unleashed, whose fault will it be?May says she is working to get a deal. The way to avoid no deal is for parliament to approve her deal, she says.She says EU nationals in the UK would have their rights respected if there is no deal. And the Polish PM has offered similar assurances to Britons living in Poland.Q: What do you think about the fact that cabinet minsters are openly talking about what should happen if your deal gets voted down, including a second referendum?May says she and other cabinet ministers have been clear that they want to get further assurances so that they can get their deal through the Commons. She says there will be further discussions with the EU.Q: Is the UK unprepared for the use of drones at airports?May says the government has already legislated to stop this. People can be sentenced to up to five years in jail for this. And the government is considering giving the police more powers, she says.Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, is speaking now.He also stresses links between the two countries.It is important to ensure Nato remains strong, he says.On Brexit, he says he appreciates the efforts Theresa May has made. He says Poland always tried to support pragmatic solutions, to make sure the withdrawal agreement was as good as possible. He says it is the best deal available.He says it would be beneficial for both sides for the agreement to come into force.The UK is leaving the EU, he says. But it is not leaving Europe, he says.He says the Polish diaspora living in the UK can feel secure now about their rights being respected. He says he is glad people have found a new home here. But he would like Poles to return home, he says.UPDATE: MLex’s Matthew Holehouse has the quote.Theresa May is speaking at the press conference now.She says the UK and Poland are key strategic allies. Their armed forces will work side by side on training exercises, and there will be increased cooperation in the Baltic Sea.She says their security services will work together against organised crime.Both countries want a peaceful Europe, and share the same concerns about threats. She says they are worried about Russia undermining the rules-based system.The trade relationship is thriving, she says. Both countries want a cleaner world, and today they have established a clean growth partnership.She says the UK and Poland are two of the most innovative economies in Europe. She says she and Mateusz Morawiecki have discussed plans for tech cooperation.She says protecting the rights of Poles and other EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit has been a priority.Her message to Poles here has been clear, she says: “You can stay, and we want you to stay.”She also repeats the line in Polish.Earlier the Polish PM, Mateusz Morawiecki, posted this on Twitter about his talks with Theresa May.Tweetdeck translates that as:The situation of Poles in the United Kingdom is a key aspect of the talks with the Prime Minister Theresą May. Our aim is also to maintain the freedom of trade, so important for Polish companies. I believe that the British Parliament will take such a decision, which is beneficial to all parties.Theresa May is about to hold a press conference with her Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki.Good news for opponents of a second referendum they have got an endorsement from one of the world’s most powerful men. As my colleague Andrew Roth reports, the Russian president Vladimir Putin has declared it would be a bad idea in his annual marathon press conference today.Showing a concern for the sanctity of democracy which has not always been a hallmark of his career, Putin argued that the will of the people must be respected. He said:Was it not a referendum? Someone disliked the result, so repeat it over and over? Is this democracy? What then would be the point of the referendum in the first place?Here is Andrew’s story in full.Almost all the increase will go towards policing, which will get an extra £84.4m.Explaining the move, Khan said:I am concerned that the government is continuing to shift the burden of police funding from government grant to council tax – which is deeply regressive and hits the poorest the hardest. However, the brutal reality of the rise in violent crime and government cuts means that I have little choice but to increase the policing element of the council tax by the maximum amount allowed by ministers. Khan also announced that he is going to spend £6.8m on significantly expanding a new violence reduction unit. This will develop a public health approach to tackling violent crime. “Using data to form a strong evidence base, the unit will use this money to identify where and how to make early interventions in a young person’s life as part of a long-term strategy to prevent the spread of violence,” Khan’s office says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/721de5288781720c05469239b35aabad84ecec8b/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d946da1495bde27b9415eb39f2c8ce60","title":"hostel christmas cheer support former rough sleepers","story":"For those who’ve spent years on the streets, the festive period can be difficult – even being indoors may be a challenge“Some people just want to sleep Christmas away, and we will respect that.” Christmas can be a challenging time for the former rough sleepers who are now residents at Montfort House in Victoria, London, a 16-bed supported housing accommodation for homeless people. For some, the period serves as a reminder of what they are missing.There will be presents, carols and turkey at Montfort House, but senior project manager Elizabeth Deegan knows the difficulties residents face at this time of year. “There are certain things that can be quite triggering for people’s mental health or addictions,” says Deegan. “It’s that real reminder of things that have happened to them in the past it might trigger certain memories of abuse or being in care, and not necessarily having had a proper Christmas before.”The challenge for Deegan and her colleagues is to find the balance between creating a sense of community and avoiding making people feel uncomfortable. She and her team will endeavour to make it as merry as possible. With heightened emotions at Christmas, residents can sometimes react unpredictably and Deegan says there does tend to be a deterioration in some people’s mental health at this time of year. She and her colleagues will carry out more intensive work with clients throughout the period, going over the coping mechanisms and things that they can do to help keep themselves safe.Years spent living on the streets can instil a sense of resilience and independence that can make some people less receptive to this work. “They’ve survived year after year after year they’re so used to being able to just deal and survive without any help,” Deegan points out. The Montfort House team works with clients at their own pace, with support from an in-house psychologist, enabling residents to take part at Christmas as much as they wish. “We just respect everyone’s wishes with how much they want to get involved.”Deegan has dealt with serious incidents around Christmas where residents have self-harmed, or even attempted suicide. “Christmas can be an incredibly worrying period for us and our clients,” she says. “As staff members, we worry about how people are going to cope with things.” And with many other services, particularly mental health support services, closed or under extra pressure during the festive period, there is even more strain on Deegan and her colleagues. “Mental health services are massively stretched already and our client group don’t necessarily fit into their criteria, so it can be a real struggle for them to even be offered help in the first place,” she says.For some residents, just being indoors can be challenging. Having adapted to living and surviving on the streets, sleeping inside can be an uncomfortable experience. “Some people have described the feeling as ‘losing power’ because a lot of things are completely out of their control,” explains Deegan. “Coming back inside can be a shock and reminds them of what’s happened earlier on in life.”On arrival, some people prefer sleep on the floor with the window open. “When someone moves on to their bed, that is one of the biggest achievements … it’s almost as though they are letting go of their old life,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38b01c2bd4c4876aceed4fac91931f3b4ff0b9ba/0_142_4482_2690/master/4482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaa6d1e6b404a2775c3b6156907c8be2","title":"altior taken out of king george vi chase discussions owner horse racing","story":"• Nicky Henderson removes chaser from Boxing Day showpiece• Altior likely to run at Ascot or Newbury next in the new yearThe saga of Altior’s possible participation in next week’s King George was finally killed off when the star two-miler’s name did not appear among the 11 entries for the race revealed on Thursday. Nicky Henderson’s charge, who is still unbeaten over obstacles, is expected to be kept to two miles for the rest of this campaign, though his trainer happily contemplates the possibility of stepping him up in distance next season.Henderson had made no secret, in recent weeks, of his opposition to the idea of running Altior over three miles next week. On one occasion, the Lambourn man said he would rather put Altior in the King’s Stand, a sprint race, than the King George. But he could not put a definitive line through the horse’s name until receiving confirmation from Altior’s owner, Patricia Pugh, who was due to return from holiday on Wednesday night.Pugh is thought to be more interested than the trainer in a change of distance but has evidently been persuaded to wait. Altior’s route to the Champion Chase in March is likely to go through the Clarence House Chase at Ascot next month or the Game Spirit at Newbury in February. He could still take in the Desert Orchid at Kempton on the day after Boxing Day, though Henderson suggested that was unlikely.Henderson will be represented in the King George by Might Bite, last year’s winner, who remains favourite for the Boxing Day contest despite finishing last on his reappearance at Haydock. A classy collection of 10 others could yet take him on, including Waiting Patiently, Politologue, Bristol De Mai, Thistlecrack and Native River, who outstayed Might Bite in the Gold Cup.Joe Tizzard, who assists his father, Colin, in training two of those, hinted that Native River has the more obvious chance in his eyes. “Thistlecrack will be an 11-year-old in 10 days’ time. He’s going into it in lovely form, we haven’t had him like this for a couple of years, so we’re looking forward to him.“But Native River’s a younger horse who’s won a Gold Cup and was the better horse at Haydock last time. They had very similar preparations and they’ve both come out of it well, they’re entitled to improve. There’s not masses between them.”No Irish raider has won the King George since 2005 and that appears certain to remain the case for another year, as the only remaining entrant from that country is Shattered Love. Gordon Elliott said on Thursday that his mare was more likely to run at Leopardstown next week but he wants to keep his options open at this stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722c379df9771ee1d78496fe7fb56fd2eeea0ce1/0_142_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fa3a201458f3902079f0ac0b956071a","title":"eoin morgan jofra archer england cricket","story":"Eoin Morgan has offered a strong endorsement of Jofra Archer’s international potential amid a more encouraging appraisal of the fast bowler’s World Cup chances.England’s one-day captain stated during the summer that only injury could see Archer make his squad for the tournament, albeit in answer to a hypothetical question given the Barbados-born quick was less than halfway through a seven-year qualification process.But with the England and Wales Cricket Board slashing its residency criteria from 1 January, the highly-rated 23-year-old will now be eligible in March once he has returned from playing Twenty20 in Australia and completed a third year of 210 days in the UK.Asked about the situation during a recent spell playing in South Africa’s Mzansi Super League, Morgan replied: “Jofra is in demand all around the world, particularly in Twenty20 cricket. One of the most exciting things about him is that he is still very young.“He’s travelled all around the world, played Big Bash, Indian Premier League and been at Sussex for a number of years now. People talk about him playing international cricket at some stage and I think that is a fair, honest assessment of the talent that he possesses.“He needs to spend more days in the country before he is available for selection. When that happens, we’ll cross that bridge and look at all aspects of selection – how everybody could benefit the team. We have recently selected the squad for the West Indies tour and it still looks really exciting.”Morgan, who like Archer had to serve a then four-year qualification period despite being a British passport-holder, is now on the same page as the national selector, Ed Smith, in keeping all options open the onus is on the squad’s fast bowlers – Mark Wood and Tom Curran in particular – to make the subject moot.The five-match series in the Caribbean in February is England’s final outing before provisional World Cup squads are submitted on 23 April and though changes can be made in the month that follows – during which time they face Ireland and Pakistan – selecting an uncapped player would represent a huge gamble, not least in terms of squad dynamics.Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, recently revealed he has been using the term “World Cup favourites” around the players for some time in a bid to lessen its impact once the main event begins against South Africa at the Oval on 30 May. Morgan appears comfortable with it.He added: “We’ve found ourselves the world’s No 1 ranked team since the start of our summer and it has sat fine with us. It hasn’t affected us. The likelihood is that we will go into the World Cup as favourites, provided something significant doesn’t happen before then.“But we are building the squad quite nicely and the guys have shown a huge amount of desire to improve their game and win matches. So it’s an exciting summer ahead for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f825dbd3a24452748b5f33e27ef833c5df50fdb/149_20_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553b525532b7b46ccd359ea873031915","title":"the scarlet pimpernel review egg bath","story":"The Egg, Bath French poodles face a dastardly end unless our swashbuckling heroes come to the rescue in this high-energy kids’ version of the classic adventure story‘Are you here for ze execution?” asks a peasant milling around the aisle. “Enjoy!” Welcome, mes amis, to what could be the season’s grisliest kids’ show. The French revolution is ablaze, the guillotine is go-go-go and the only hope for aristos facing the blade is a last-minute rescue by the mysterious, masked Scarlet Pimpernel.In this pleasingly preposterous take for the over-sixes, presented by Pins and Needles and the Egg in Bath, poodles are detested by revolutionaries as “the symbol of all that is wrong with France”. The pooches are up for the chop along with their bewigged owners. Yes, this is a festive treat about decapitating dogs – and, in one rousing song, mincing them into sausages.Our hero is reinvented as the Scarlet Pimple, his calling card an acned nose instead of a flower, but the story loosely follows Baroness Orczy’s novel. The swashbuckling Pimple commands a league of noblemen and disguises his identity with another persona, as silk-loving nincompoop Sir Percy, insufferable to everyone and especially his wife, Marguerite. By the time she discovers she’s married to the masked crusader, he needs rescuing.In the snug Egg theatre, a hard-working cast of five are constantly in and out of the audience, creating the sense of a revolutionary throng baying for blood. They juggle roles, from English whelk-sellers to French spies, and in a whirlwind scene worthy of The 39 Steps play all 20 of the Pimple’s league of conspirators, each given Top Trumps-style ratings for brains and bravery. Emma Earle and Joe Hufton’s production is studded with musical set pieces including a grand ball featuring wheeled mannequins, nicely splattered – like much of Zoe Squire’s set – in shades of the tricolour.As Sir Percy, Emile Clarke hits haughty heights, sporting glam apparel that makes Leslie Howard in the 1934 film look drab. But the character behind the double personas of Percy and the Pimple remains elusive and it’s hard to cheer him on.

The cost for older iPhones such as the 5S will be £79.Battery replacements within the warranty period, or if the user has Apple’s extended warranty, AppleCare+, are free.Apple said in December last year that it intentionally slowed iPhones via software updates to prolong their useful life and avoid power problems caused by degraded batteries in older devices.But it did so without informing users, leading many to accuse the company of resorting to planned obsolescence, something Apple strongly denies.Apple was questioned by the US Senate over its actions, faced inquiries in various countries, and was forced to make multiple apologies.

(After I’ve changed my email address.) GeoffreyGoogle’s motto used to be “don’t be evil”, but in the eyes of some it has now taken on the mantle of the “evil empire” from Microsoft, which Bill Gates and crew inherited from the IBM mocked in the Mac’s launch advert in 1984.The EU has fined Google €2.4bn (£2.2bn) for abusing its search monopoly by favouring its products. Most recently, Google was fined €4.34bn for “very serious illegal behaviour” in using Android “to cement its dominance as a search engine”, according to the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, a charge the company contests.Google started by taking over the search engine market. It now dominates smartphone operating systems (Android), browsers (Chrome), web-based email (Gmail), online video (YouTube) and maps. It is also challenging in other areas with its own cloud platform, an online office suite, Chromebooks, Waze, Nest and so on. Google is far advanced in driverless cars (Waymo) and artificial intelligence (DeepMind). Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.We can probably agree Google has won by delivering high-quality products, and more than 40 corpses in the Google Graveyard – soon to be joined by its awful social network, Google+ – prove it doesn’t always win. But there are other problems.First, Google now controls web development to the point where not even Microsoft can compete, as shown by the latter’s recent decision to replace its EdgeHTML browser engine with the open source Chromium on which Google’s Chrome browser is based. Users were supposed to benefit from competition between rival implementations of open web standards, but today Chromium and therefore Chrome is the standard.As Firefox-developer Mozilla has pointed out, “from a social, civic and inidual empowerment perspective, ceding control of fundamental online infrastructure to a single company is terrible”.Second, many of us have problems with Google’s business model, which the Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff has called “surveillance capitalism”. Google finances its free services by tracking users and targeting them with advertisements. In fact, it tracks you across the web even if you never visit any Google properties because other websites commonly use Google AdWords, AdMob, DoubleClick, Google Analytics, and its other tracking or advertising products.From your searches and site visits, Google probably knows more about you than your mother or your spouse, and there’s no telling where that information will eventually end up.If you use an Android phone, Google can also track your physical location, and if you turn that off, you lose directions, “find my phone” and other features.So, remember that avoiding Google products is only part of the problem. You will need to protect your privacy in other ways, too.The simplest way to avoid most Google products is to switch to the Microsoft or Apple equivalents, in whole or in part. Some would see this as jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. However, Satya Nadella’s new Microsoft is different from the old one, and driven by other metrics (usage instead of units). It is building a broader cross-platform ecosystem than either Google (everything online) or Apple (everything on Apple).The web-based Outlook email service is still not as good as Gmail, but you can use it from a desktop email client, and there’s a decent Mail app in Windows 10. There are also plenty of alternative services, including FastMail and ProtonMail.Cyanogenmod, an open source ROM to liberate Android phones, bit the dust a while ago, but the project is continuing as LineageOS.Google controls the browser market, so the best alternative to Chrome is Mozilla’s Firefox. With Opera and now Microsoft capitulating, Mozilla is the only major provider still committed to building its own standards-based browser.Fortunately, Chrome’s rendering engine has open source origins – Apple forked KHTML to create WebKit for Safari, then Google forked WebKit to create Blink for Chrome – so the base code is available in the form of Chromium. This has enabled lots of companies to build browsers based on Chromium, without the proprietary stuff that Google adds to create Chrome. Opera and Vivaldi are the most obvious examples, though you should also look at the privacy oriented Epic, among others.You will not be entirely free of Google, as you would be with Firefox, but it seems to me an acceptable compromise.Either way, I avoid using Chrome because now when you sign into a Google site, it signs you into the browser as well, unless you deactivate the feature.Google still has the best search engine, but Bing and DuckDuckGo are viable alternatives for the majority of searches. If you can’t avoid Google search completely, you can certainly reduce your usage.DuckDuckGo is a good choice because it is privacy oriented, and you can run Google searches from DDG by using a !bang command. (A bang is an American exclamation mark.) However, DDG’s sources include other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo and Yandex.StartPage – formerly ixQuick – is a Dutch-owned privacy-protecting search engine, while Qwant is a French one. Both get some results from other search engines, but Google still won’t know about you. (Qwant seems to be pretty good.)Mojeek is a British search engine that has its own web crawler, called MojeekBot.For image and reverse image searches, I recommend Yandex, which is Russian, Bing and TinEye.There have been plenty of websites that will download the videos you want to watch without you having to go to YouTube. Years ago, I used KeepVid. However, this approach does not suit Google because you never see any adverts. Also, these sites – which could be flaky to start with – tend to stop working properly, andor pop up multiple ad pages.The indirect approach does not suit users either because the whole idea is that you go to watch one YouTube video then get sucked into watching another dozen through random browsing.Web traffic statistics suggest there’s one property with both the technology and the capacity to take on YouTube, and that’s PornTube, but it’s not quite the same.Have you got a question?

A new initiative will soundproof venues, helping to protect clubs from closureClubbers of the world rejoice: the techno mecca of Berlin is to receive a €1m (£900,000) boost from the local government to protect its renowned clubbing culture.The funding will go towards soundproofing projects, with the aim of improving relations between venues and local residents, based on a similar project in Hamburg. The noise protection programme, which was proposed last year and came into effect on 30 November 2018, indicates the importance of Berlin’s nightlife culture and its relevance to the city’s economy, including the tourism industry. According to German newspaper, Der Tagesspiegel, senator Ramona Pop said: “Berlin’s club culture is known worldwide and a hallmark of our city.”Since 2011, around 170 Berlin nightclubs have reportedly been forced to close, many shutting their doors after disputes with residents over noise. The new project will protect many of the famous venues – Berghain, Watergate, Sisyphos, :about blank and Griessmühle – that have become part of the cultural scene, as well as being tourist attractions.The list of venues set to receive funding is still to be decided. An independent jury of experts will meet several times in February, May and September 2019 to select the venues that best qualify. The online application site states that the project is aimed “primarily to subsidise noise reduction measures” while “taking into account the erse needs of those affected”, and may give priority to “current conflict situations”.This isn’t the first time Berlin’s government has stepped in to help the city’s clubbing scene. In 2012, €1m was pledged to protect it in the wake of what was called Clubsterben (literally club death), helping venues to find new locations and hold fundraising concerts. City politicians were forced to address the significant economic impact of a potential drop in visitors, many of whom are young Europeans who fly to Berlin, sometimes just for one or two nights.In the UK, London’s once-vibrant club scene has fallen on hard times in recent years, with councils implementing strict licencing rules and curfews. However, last year the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, introduced new protections for venues in the Draft London Plan. This included the Agent of Change principle to ensure developers building new residential properties near clubs, pubs, and live music venues will be responsible for ensuring they are adequately soundproofed and designed to reduce sound, instead of what can be crippling costs falling on the venues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1f7d696d3645f45e5418fa94d0a28549087cb83/1013_592_2987_1792/master/2987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6aba967e0129f0d1b9b04867b98d6b52","title":"travel quiz christmas special 2018","story":"There’s an unlimited baggage allowance with our bumper quiz about international travellers, flags, travel-related song lyrics and more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17dba6ddf11f57a264c9d4beb530aad8388921b0/0_147_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e6b99971af7692db4c20b41c67ff13","title":"why im giving up social media for christmas tom price tourist trap bbc","story":"The star of the BBC’s Tourist Trap admits that ‘nobody wants another #Whitstable2017’, so he’s planning a seasonal digital detoxThis Christmas, spare a thought for the thousands of people employed in the advertising industry who have to watch their creative gold being tallied directly against actual sales.

He was blinking, mid-tantrum.Three: Both sons, and their friends, smiling over big plates of fish and chips. They ate two chips each, for a total cost of £40. I insisted on doggy bags, which I then left in the back of the car for nearly a week.Four: All the children collecting shells. They weren’t they were looking for some money I’d dropped on purpose to make it look like they were collecting shells.Five: My eldest son standing next to a buoy, smiling – a concept I came up with so I could use the catchphrase “Buoy meets boy”. It took 45 minutes to walk out to it, we nearly drowned on the way back, and it only got 18 Likes.

From Pete Seeger’s 1959 rendition of the African American gospel We Shall Overcome, which became an anthem for the civil rights movement, to Dick Gaughan’s Ballad of ‘84, a clarion call for the Scottish miners’ strike, the combination of one singer and their guitar has had a potent effect on galvanising activists.Now, folk is turning its attention to the bees.The stakes are high and 25-year-old fiddle player Rowan Piggott believes that folk is the answer. “The environmental crisis is one of the biggest issues of my generation,” he says. “All of our political and economic problems pale in comparison, since they tend to go in cycles, whereas we have done irreversible damage with climate change.”A waifish presence in a tweed jacket, Piggott is surprisingly optimistic about the future. “People’s knowledge of the crisis is very general,” he says, “and they often don’t know what they can do to effect a meaningful change, so that’s why I started the Songhive project, to give people chances to get involved with the bees.”Since Piggott’s father is an acclaimed traditional Irish folk musician and his mother is a beekeeper, the project seemed inevitable. Piggott noticed an accumulation of folksongs about the plight of the bees, such as Lau’s 2012 instrumental Save The Bees, and decided to create an online archive to raise awareness.“I thought it’d be a nice way of reminding people that for thousands of years we’ve had a healthy respect for bees as part of our life-cycle and now that people are more distanced from the process of producing food, we have forgotten that and bees have become a mild annoyance,” he says.With the archive up and running and the folk community responding, Piggott decided to up the ante. “I always had the idea for making a record,” he says, “although I initially thought it would be a compilation of already-recorded music from the archive.” Due to costly licensing fees, the record became a collection of 11 songs written and recorded especially for the project. Piggott invested £1,000 of his own money and raised a £2,000 grant from the English folk dance and song society to print the finished CDs.Featuring Piggott himself and some of the British folk scene’s young stars, such as Rosie Hodgson and Georgia Lewis, as well as more established acts such as singer Nancy Kerr and songwriter Nick Burbridge, the album combines traditional folk instrumentation with bee-themed lyrics in the service of this environmental cause. Even the bees themselves are almost present, as their buzz is imitated by a shruti drone on Burbidge’s Queen’s Dream of Lost Fields, while Kerr’s Dark Honey addresses the production of honey from the sugary remnants of discarded Coke cans.Since the CD was released in March, half of its 1,000 copies has been sold, raising £5,000 for a Friends of the Earth campaign, the Bee Cause. Piggott has also been encouraging his audience to learn and perform bee folksongs from the archive and sign petitions. One such petition, to ban the use of the harmful insecticide neonicotinoid, was successful and passed the EU in April.“The response has been great,” he enthuses, “all ages have gotten involved. The older fans buy the record and the younger ones are active in spreading the message.”Rosie Hodgson, 26, contributed two compositions to Songhive and believes folk is the perfect vehicle for the environmental message. “Folk music was mostly created and performed by those who were in positions of vulnerability,” she says, “injustice is a common theme and it harnesses the power of a personal story, so one well-placed tale will inspire sympathy for a cause in a way that talking about the cause as a whole will not. There’s a magic that binds people when they sing together, especially in times of hardship.”Another contributor, Nancy Kerr, has made environmental awareness an integral part of her writing in recent years, with her last album, Instar, comprising folksongs about nature and conservation. For Kerr, born to a family of traditional musicians involved in protest music, folk is an activist’s genre. “The act of relating a narrative that stems from the experiences of disenfranchised people is an act of protest,” she says, “and that makes me view folk music as intrinsically political.”With CD stock expecting to be sold out by the end of the year, Piggott is looking towards a second album, perhaps widening the scope beyond the bees. “It’s not just bees, it’s other pollinators like butterflies that are in danger – everything’s in trouble,” he says.For now, though, he is planning a Songhive tour with Rosie Hodgson and some of Songhive’s other musicians. They are currently booking venues that have links to conservation, even hoping to serenade the bees in a wildflower meadow.“Bees are the perfect species to drive meaningful action because we feel so positively towards them. They are a linchpin species,” Hodgson says.For Piggott, the bees are a vehicle for optimistic action and a means for folk to be refocused to its political roots. “Folk music here isn’t the people’s music anymore,” he says, “it’s become commercialised and the general public don’t know what it should sound like. This project is about tapping back into that heritage and aiming it towards a cause that people can actively change right now, today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88ad78bf21779e57bc496363e70512054dbb303/760_136_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9dc7d492805dfeb60e97f7f78c23676","title":"china accused of tit for tat over detention of canadian woman","story":"Third Canadian held in China after recent arrest of Huawei executive in VancouverThe Chinese foreign ministry has said a Canadian woman is undergoing “administrative punishment” for working illegally, after Canada’s government said a third Canadian had been detained in China.Chinese state security agents last week detained the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and the businessman Michael Spavor, saying both Canadians were suspected of endangering state security.The detentions followed the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications corporation Huawei. Meng was arrested at the request of the US, which has been engaged in a trade war with China.China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, identified the third Canadian as Sarah McIver, saying she was serving “administrative punishment” due to “illegal employment”. Hua did not elaborate.“What I can tell you is that China and Canada are maintaining clear consular communication,” she told a daily news briefing.Hua, when asked if McIver’s case was connected to that of Kovrig and Spavor, said the nature of the cases were different, given the other two were accused of endangering national security.Hua referred further questions on McIver to the ministry of public security. It did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.The Canadian government has not identified the third person, though news reports in Canada have said it is McIver, and that she was an English teacher being held because of “visa complications”.Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged caution on Wednesday and said he would not be “stomping on a table” after China detained the third Canadian. He said he was asking China for more information on the detentions.The latest incident was “a very separate case” from the other two, Trudeau said. The Canadian government has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor.But Beijing-based western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believed the detentions were a “tit-for-tat” reprisal by China.China has demanded Meng’s immediate release and summoned the Canadian and US ambassadors to complain about the case. Meng has been accused by the US of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating US sanctions.She was released on bail in Vancouver, where she owns two homes, while waiting to learn if she would be extradited to the US. Meng is due in court on 6 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e568da915ae25a2576958f55273f67029fa83615/0_314_4714_2829/master/4714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ca225ffd9d1da1150675f3c75c622ca","title":"drc presidential election postponed for at least a week congo","story":"Congolese electoral commission ‘technically unable’ to hold Sunday’s voteA presidential election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to take place on Sunday will be delayed by at least a week, the country’s electoral commission has announced.The Independent National Electoral Commission said it was unable to organise the vote on time and the poll would now take place about seven days later than planned. Candidates received a text message telling them the CENI president, Corneille Nangaa, had decided the commission was “technically unable” to hold the election as scheduled.The delay will anger supporters of the DRC’s fractured opposition and dismay observers who hoped the election would bring a measure of security to the country. It is also likely to raise tensions and could prompt significant protests.The DRC’s outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, refused to leave office at the end of his second term in 2016 and only reluctantly agreed not to stand this time round. The country’s constitution limits presidents to two consecutive terms.Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, a former interior minister and Kabila loyalist, is standing for  the ruling coalition instead.Kabila has been in power since 2001 and the election would be the DRC’s first democratic transition of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.Opposition candidates have warned any delay would be unacceptable.“The CENI president said there will be an election, rain or shine, on 23 December,” said Martin Fayulu, one of the two leading opposition candidates. “We cannot accept a change of Mr Nangaa’s position today.”  Fayulu is part of an opposition coalition, which issued a statement on Wednesday saying authorities “had ample time to prepare credible and peaceful elections”.“They have not done so … so we are discovering their real objective: remain in power to pillage the country and kill the Congolese population which deeply hopes for a change,” the coalition added.There were reports of protests by students at the University of Kinshasa after news of the delay became known.Many in the DRC believe the blaze was an attempt by authorities to smear the opposition and provide an excuse for a delay to the polls.Local media reported CENI had cited three reasons for the delay: the deaths of more than 100 people in ethnic violence in the north-west this week, an outbreak of Ebola in the east and a shortfall in the number of ballot papers it had been able to distribute.The DRC refused international assistance with the organisation of the election. This was despite the massive logistical challenge of a poll in a violent, unstable country the size of western Europe that has no proper road or rail system and a population of about 80 million people.Campaigning has already been banned in Kinshasa because of concerns about violence.Seven people have been killed by security forces during the campaign, while many more have been arrested.The prosecutor of the international criminal court, Fatou Bensouda, said the risk of escalating violence could lead to the “commission of grave crimes”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"We don\u0026rsquot think a no-deal Brexit is a probability, but it\u0026rsquos a possibility, Leo Varadkar saysAlan Ellis (26) attacked staff member delivering toilet paper to his cell at MountjoyArmy called in to assist in locating devices and operator as flight cancellations soarBill finished final stages in D\u0026aacuteil and Seanad earlier this monthUK airline routes within EU to be \u0026lsquofrozen\u0026rsquo for twelve months following BrexitAssistant keeper challenging suspension over complaints of sexual harassmentMinister says State will own hospital and care will be delivered without religious distinctionKuwaiti national Maha Al Adheem stabbed three-year-old autistic boy 20 timesMalawian man whose sister killed for having albinism had been refused protection hereIndustry wants more \u0026lsquoon the ground\u0026rsquo information and supports for affected businessesEoin Berkley (25) admitted attacking Spanish student at Irish Glass Bottle Company siteFinal statements being heard in murder trial of Keith Connorton (40)Minister for Foreign Affairs responds to TDs\u0026rsquo letter calling for action on rights abusesFamily law courts building evacuated as Garda operation mountedMinister for Justice has published Bill to give effect to referendum resultMan claims elderly woman with dementia is being unlawfully detained as a ward of courtStormont head says plans must be in place to address potential disruptionMcDowell says people who are ambivalent about law must take responsibility for situations such as thisIctu recommends seeking larger increases in more profitable sectorsEric Wansboro challenged decision he was not entitled to rely on unconstitutionality finding"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3738408.1545320047!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government must produce more detailed no deal brexit plans business group","story":"Fruit and vegetable importers in Dublin are unconvinced by the Governments no-deal Brexit plans.

Acute trade bottlenecks would be created overnight,” said Mr O’Brien.“Jobs and businesses would be immediately on the line. Companies are preparing insofar as they can, but the economy is simply not in a position to deal with such an unprecedented and profound shock.”Ibec has called for a new business stabilisation fund to provide short-term finance to companies affected by Brexit, supports for companies looking for new markets beyond the UK and a measure that would allow companies claim Vat as an input credit at the same time as declaring their liability to minimise cashflow needs.British Irish Chamber of Commerce director-general John McGrane said the Government’s contingency plan shows “the stark reality of the disruption ahead.” The chamber would work with officials and state agencies to “help deliver as many practical supports as possible for all businesses,” he said. The Government’s contingency plan says that it intends to buy land at Dublin and Rosslare ports for new offices, public counters and parking for trucks in anticipation for increased customs checks and border inspections. There may be a requirement for up to 45 emergency legislative measures with a disorderly Brexit.“A no-deal Brexit would be an exceptional economic event which would be met with exceptional measures to support the continued operation of the Irish economy and our international trading links,” the report said.The contingency plan drew concerned reaction across the business sector.The Irish Exporters Association welcomed the actions to build new border inspection and customs facilities at Dublin and Rosslare ports but warned that there were still “capacity and capability concerns” on access and capacity at both ports.The group said that if no Brexit deal is agreed, exporters will need “strong and immediate short-term financial assistance for businesses”. It said it regretted that a large focus of the plan “lies on working primarily through State agencies”. The Irish Pharmacy Union said the contingency plan was “long overdue” but the pharmacies needed “clear guidance and practical solutions” to benefit patients in a no-deal Brexit.“Without comprehensive answers from the Government, pharmacists cannot reassure patients that they will not have to change their medications or get new prescriptions from their doctors,” said Darragh O’Loughlin, secretary general of the union. The Killybegs Fisherman’s Organisation has warned that a no-deal Brexit would be “apocalyptic” for the Irish fisheries industry given its reliance on stocks in UK waters.“There is nothing in the document other than telling us what the problem is,” said KFO chief executive Sean O’Donoghue of the contingency plan.He welcomed the fact that the plan noted that the critical issue for the fisheries sector in Ireland and a number of other EU member states was the maintenance of reciprocal access to fisheries waters and resources.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He said other budget airlines were quicker to cancel flights and allow passengers return to the departure lounge while “we were being held”.“It was a very confined area, there wasn’t enough chairs, there is literally nothing there apart from a vending machine that only accepted cash . . . they (Aer Lingus) were well over the three-hour requirement to provide water,” he said.Mr Connon said he decided he would book another flight from a different airport but as he couldn’t retrieve a bag he had checked in “I didn’t have the option to leave”.He said he has “never had this level of disruption” travelling previously and that furniture which was due to be delivered to his home had to be cancelled.“I didn’t see the drone, I heard people say they did but I don’t know how anyone could see it from the terminal building,” he added.The Irish Aviation Authority said its register of drones and model aircraft stands at 11,197.“We strongly encourage people to a drone user course, in order to help ensure that they operate their drone in a safe manner and in compliance with the regulations,” a spokesman said.The IAA also said the European Commission are currently developing new regulations.Drones are forbidden from Dublin Airport and the airport vicinity due to the risk of a drone colliding with an aircraft or being ingested into the aircraft’s engine.“The safety and security of passengers, staff and other airport users is Dublin Airport’s key priority, but for operational reasons we never comment on specific security matters,” a spokesman for Dublin Airport said. – Additional reporting agencies"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3738318.1545317635!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"blasphemy offence due to be removed by easter","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan  said his Bill would ensure that prosecutions for blasphemy will be no longer possible. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is planning to remove the offence of blasphemy by next Easter.Mr Flanagan today published a Bill to give effect to the result of October’s referendum where voters overwhelmingly supported the proposal to remove blasphemy as an offence from the Constitution.Mr Flanagan said his Bill would ensure that prosecutions for blasphemy will be no longer possible. The Department of Justice expects that the legislation will be passed by mid-April, depending on what Brexit-related legislation needs to be passed before then.“During the course of the referendum campaign, it was made very clear that, in the event of the referendum proposal being agreed, the Government would respond by bringing forward legislation which would repeal sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009 which provide a statutory basis for the offence of blasphemy. The repeal of those sections is the key element in the General Scheme which has been published on my Department’s website. The proposed repeal is fully in accord with the policy that it should no longer be possible to initiate a prosecution for blasphemy in this jurisdiction.”Mr Flanagan said he is also moving to reform defamation laws.“I would like to confirm that my Department is finalising a review of the Defamation Act 2009 which will address issues other than those falling within the scope of the cheme which has just been published.”He said after a public consultation, issues to be covered by the review will include the respective roles of judge and jury in defamation cases, the defences available to the media in the context of public-interest news reporting, and the level of damages which can be awarded by Irish courts in defamation cases.“This review is a priority for me and I expect that it should be completed during the first quarter of 2019”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3737521.1545258579!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord totes awk as leo and eoghan drop for chat in dublin school","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Defence Forces chief of staff vice-admiral Mark Mellett with Ringsend College students at the launch of the Global Schools programme on Wednesday. Photograph: Nick BradshawIt’s the last day of the Dáil session and Leo Varadkar is looking forward to taking some time off. He starts the morning with a visit to a secondary school in Ringsend.In the year since he became Taoiseach, his ability to indulge in small talk has improved in leaps and bounds. But there is still some way to go.He asks a group of students about their exams.“How-how-how are they goin’? I remember doing Christmas exams.”“But, em . . . and you finish then on Friday?”“Same,” nods the Taoiseach, on their level now. “Same here.”All set for Funderland, no doubt.And then the Taoiseach is, like: “So, em, looking forward to it. Hope you are too.”Mercifully, a teacher intervenes. “That’s great, thanks very much.”You would think Leo might have left well enough alone at this point. But no. He’s totally smashing this small-talk thing.He says a few words about international relations (because he is launching the Government’s Global Schools programme) and then looks over to where his buddy, the Minister for Housing, is seated. Ringsend College is in Eoghan Murphy’s Dublin Bay South constituency.“Do you recognise Eoghan?” the Taoiseach smilingly asks the students, because he’s one of their mates now.“He’s, eh, he’s your local TD,” perseveres Leo, grinning. Unlike Eoghan, who is glowering.Whatever about the students, or mortified Murph, the Taoiseach appears to be enjoying himself.“Do you know the names of any of the other TDs in the area?” he wonders.“They’re very shy,” interjects the kindly teacher. But Leo doesn’t get the hint.“So we’ll take a question from Abbie?” suggests the teacher, valiantly trying to move things along.But Leo, in the discomfited presence of his dudemeister Murph, can’t resist. “That wouldn’t happen in Blanchardstown.”Strained laughter followed by another awkward pause.So the teacher – she deserves a medal – swoops in.“So, em, Abbie is just here. . .”Finally, he stops.But before Leo could escape for his hols, he had to put in one more stint at Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil. It was a relatively low-key session, with the Ceann Comhairle dispensing Christmas good wishes and the party leaders following suit.But we had no novelty Christmas tie this year from Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh, disappointing all the kiddies around the country who tuned into RTÉ to see what tune it would play this year. They all looked a bit tired on the Sinn Féin benches, probably because they had their Christmas drinks the night before.In an historic first, the Shinners invited members of the media to enjoy a drink with them in the Dáil bar before they left for their knees-up. This was hailed as a milestone in the progression of the party.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil treated the hacks to more free drink upstairs in McGrattan’s bar near Government Buildings. Micheál Martin described it as “a very agreeable night” in the course of his Christmas felicitations to the chamber.Before the event, it was rumoured that the Fianna Fáil leader exhorted some of his more difficult charges to attend the drinks and talk to the members of the press because it would be a nice change for him to see them conversing before his eyes as opposed to behind his back, as they usually do.We hear an anti-abortion Fine Gael Senator stumbled upon the gathering by accident, and was momentarily confused. “This isn’t the Oireachtas Human Dignity Group,” he was heard to utter, before leaving for another part of the pub where members of the cross-party group – founders include Senator Rónán Mullen – were letting their hair down.A great night was had by all, but group members Mattie McGrath and fellow TDs Carol Nolan and Michael Collins were up bright and early so they could take part in a plan to occupy the Baggot Street offices of KBC bank in protest over the eviction of people from a house in Co Roscommon last week. The three, who were part of a wider protest, said they were also concerned with the way the bank deals with people in mortgage arrears.Meanwhile, back in the chamber in the post-luncheon period, the Dáil was hearing statements on the European Council meeting earlier this month. They were well under way when Mick Wallace arrived to speak. He was very full of the Christmas cheer.“Good to see you here, Taoiseach. Don’t normally see you here for Euro statements, you usually abscond the place before then.”Leo was gathering up his files. It was past three and he had been in the chamber since midday.Mick didn’t want him to go just as he was about to talk about Brexit and the announcement by Irish Ferries that the company is “unlikely” to continue sailings between Rosslare and France next year.He pleaded with the Taoiseach.“What, are you going already, are ya? Ah, come on. Eh, com’ere, sit down for a minute, come on, come on, sit down!”“I did stay here for everyone who was here for my contribution,” said the Taoiseach, on his feet.“Please. Wha? It won’t kill ya to sit down,” wheedled Mick.“Merry Christmas,” smiled Leo, skipping the joint.“What are you like? Em, oh, God help us,” spluttered Mick.“Anyway, listen. . .” And the TD for Wexford, wherein resides the port of Rosslare, got on with his speech and then vanished too.Later in the evening, the Taoiseach invited his Cabinet to join him for mulled wine and mince pies in Government Buildings.We don’t know if the Ministers of State were invited along too. If so, the guests will have wished Kilkenny’s John Paul Phelan all the best for his big day – the Minister of State for Local Government and Electoral Reform is getting married on Friday.Dáil Éireann returns on January 15th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3737918.1545300532!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit tory minister says there is plausible argument for second referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Amber Rudd speaks to the media outside the House of Commons. File photograph: Andy Rain EPAThere is a “plausible argument” for the public to be asked to vote again on Brexit if MPs remain deadlocked, a British cabinet minister has said.Amber Rudd acknowledged her comments would “distress” some of her Tory colleagues and stressed she was fully committed to the UK prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal.The UK work and pensions secretary insisted she did not want a referendum and called for MPs across the Commons to reach a consensus as a way of preventing a no-deal Brexit if Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is thrown out in January’s parliamentary showdown.But her intervention was welcomed as a “massive moment” by campaigners calling for a so-called people’s vote, with Tory former minister Anna Soubry praising Ms Rudd as “brave and principled”.Ms Rudd backed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to support if the prime minister’s deal is rejected.Ms Rudd told ITV’s Peston: “I don’t want a people’s vote, or a referendum in general, but if Parliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus I could see there would be a plausible argument for it.”She added: “Parliament has to reach a majority on how it’s going to leave the European Union. “If it fails to do so, then I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues.”Ms Rudd said an indicative vote would “flush out” MPs by forcing them to show their support for one option or another, and encourage those whose favoured ideas are rejected to reach a compromise.“We are going to have to find a way, as MPs, of working together to find a consensus, of agreeing on how to stop no-deal taking place,” she said. Her comments were seized on by pro-EU campaigners.Labour’s Owen Smith, a backer of anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “Amber Rudd may be the first Tory Cabinet member to say she’d rather have a people’s vote than allow a catastrophic no-deal to unfold, but she won’t be the last. This is a massive moment for our campaign.”Meanwhile, Ireland followed the UK and the European Union in setting out the latest stages of its no-deal Brexit planning.“In many significant ways, a no-deal Brexit would pose unique, unprecedented and extremely difficult challenges for the EU, including Ireland, and especially the UK,” the Irish Government document said.As part of the plan, Dublin Port is creating extra parking for hundreds of trucks from the UK awaiting inspection after Brexit.In London, Mrs May will meet her Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki for talks.The discussions are expected to focus on defence and security co-operation, but come as the Prime Minister is desperately trying to secure further reassurances from EU leaders about the Northern Ireland backstop measures in the Brexit deal before the crunch Commons vote in the week commencing January 14th.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who met the prime minister on Wednesday, said Mrs May’s goals were “a wee bit nebulous”.“There’s not a lot of detail there,” Ms Sturgeon said.“She says she’s working with the EU, trying to find assurances. I pressed her to give a bit more detail on that. I have to say it wasn’t forthcoming.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It is now behind countries such as Ireland, Australia and Canada and is just about the Czech and Slovak Republic. The quality of official development assistance (ODA) is one of the few measures of aid quality and is based on principles which the UK, along with other donor and recipient countries, agreed to in 2005.The UK, alongside a handful of other countries including Germany and the Netherlands, meets the United Nations target of spending 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on international aid.Index of aid quality | Country rankingsBut the report said that one of the reasons for the UK falling down the rankings could be because of the countries it chooses to give aid to. The report highlights how multiple studies have shown that aid is most effective when spent in poorer and better governed countries.But the UK spends around 50 per cent of its aid in countries that are governed poorly - three of its biggest recipients are Pakistan, Lebanon and Nigeria - both poorly governed and less poor.Ian Mitchell, the report’s author, said this focus on certain countries could have pulled the UK down the rankings.“The UK does focus on fragile states and less poor countries because they’re seen as a security issue. But is possible to give substantially to fragile states and to score well on aid quality, he said.The UK has an explicit strategy to dedicate at least 50 per cent of Department for International Development (DfID) funding to fragile states and regions.He added: Still, other countries that score among the top donors such as Denmark and Ireland also spend at least 50 per cent of their bilateral aid in (UK-defined) fragile states.UK country allocations should consider a range of factors, but examples of states that DfID defines as fragile but which are also low income include Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Niger.Disease of thorns | The battle to eliminate trachomaThe UK scored poorly on indicators looking at whether its aid aligns with donors’ objectives - again, this could be to do with the focus on fragile states, said Mr Mitchell.The UK has been channeling more of its ODA through other departments such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills - not just via DfID. The proportion spent by DfID fell from 79 per cent in 2012 to 75 per cent in 2016.This has been linked to a fall in the UK’s performance on transparency, dropping from first place to 13th place on the public accessibility of information on funding.“Other government departments aren’t meeting standards on transparency that we would expect,” said Mr Mitchell.Romilly Greenhill, UK director of the One Campaign, an advocacy group, said the report painted a worrying picture.“One of the main drivers of this is that increasing amounts of aid are being spent outside DfID, by departments who don’t meet the same high standards of poverty focus, effectiveness and transparency, she said. A DfID spokesperson said: “We disagree that UK aid quality has declined... To help countries drive their own development, the UK provides support in a way that reinforces and strengthens local responsibility, accountability and leadership.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security ​Department for International DevelopmentPolice call in the Army to help deal with Gatwick chaos as drones cause runway to close - live updatesNew species of big predator dinosaur found in marble quarry in ItalyBethlehem to launch app to control tourist crowds at Church of the NativityBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39Harvey Weinstein judge declines to dismiss #MeToo sexual assault case against him - live updatesUK funded inflatable operating theater set to revolutionise emergency surgery Scientists investigate upsurge in polio-like illness in childrenIndian police charge four with murder over poisoning plot at Indian temple that killed 15 devotees US \u0026#39will end airstrikes against Isil in Syria after American forces withdraw\u0026#39Putin calls for better UK-Russia relations at massive annual press conferenceLabour MP convicted for lying to police over speeding offence compares her plight to Jesus and other biblical figuresPothole compensation quadruples in just one year as campaigners urge road bosses to fix problems \u0026#39ASAP\u0026#39Comment: Amber Rudd hasn\u0026#39t gone rogue.

Although he had not discussed partnerships with Theresa May, Mr Putin said that business communities in both countries were holding productive talks.The President also advised the UK should go through with Brexit, saying that otherwise it wasn\u0027t really a referendum.However, Mr Putin, whose approval ratings have fallen after a turbulent year, skirted the single question asked about Russia\u0027s role in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal. He termed the story propaganda, and was not pressed to explain why he had called the suspects in the Salisbury poisoning civilians, after documents and interviews with neighbours showed the pair to belong to military intelligence. Asked about America\u0027s withdrawal from Syria, Mr Putin welcomed the announcement. Let\u0027s not forget, the presence of your troops there is illegitimate, he said. More than 1,700 journalists were accredited to attend what state television called the “main media event of the year”. This number was a new record, as it is most years. In nearly four hours of questions, Putin failed to address the Skripal suspects\u0027 identities, who he previously claimed were civilians but have since been shown to be military intelligence. He only took one question about Salisbury and that was a softball from RTWhen asked about the Wagner mercenaries and their patron Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is known as “Putin\u0027s chef” for serving the president during state dinners, the Russian leader insisted he had nothing to do with them. Mr Prigozhin has been sanctioned for interfering in the US election with his troll factory and was recently filmed taking part in a meeting between Russian military chiefs and Libyan military leader Khalifa Haftar. “All my chefs are in the federal guard service, they are from the military. I don\u0027t have any other chefs,” he said. As for Wagner, if “they\u0027re not violating Russian law, they have the right to sell their services anywhere on the planet,” he said. Three journalists were killed while investigating the Russian mercenaries\u0027 presence in the Central African Republic in July. Mr Putin distanced himself from their killing, saying they had entered the country under the guise of tourists and were assassinated by local groups.Mr Putin said he spoke with Theresa May on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina, and argued that Russia\u0027s trade with Britain was increasing in spite of Brexit. “We greeted each other and spoke a few words to each other,” Mr Putin said. “In my mind, UK-Russian relations are at a dead end and it\u0027s in the interests of both sides to get out of this dead end. As for the effects of Brexit, I think it\u0027s minimal, but it will influence the world economy and us indirectly.”Mr Putin, whose troll factory was found to have put out pro-Brexit tweets on the day of the vote, said the UK should go through with Brexit, “otherwise it wasn\u0027t really a referendum”.  The UK invested $22 billion in Russia this year, making it the top direct investor, he added. “It\u0027s their affair, but in any case they\u0027re interested in markets, in partnerships,” he said. “I didn\u0027t talk about this with the prime minister, but we are talking about this with our friends and colleagues from Great Britain, especially in the business sphere.”And finally the question that\u0027s been on everyone\u0027s mind: When will Putin get remarried and to whom? The Russian leader, who is so protective of his private life that his daughters\u0027 identities were unknown until recently,  orced his wife in 2013. He\u0027s married and he wants me to be too, Putin joked about the journalist who asked the question. Alas, he gave no straight answer: As an orderly person I should do this at some point.“In this Donald is right, I agree with him,” Mr Putin said when asked about Mr Trump\u0027s statement that Isil had been defeated.  “As for US troops in Syria, I don\u0027t think they\u0027re needed, let\u0027s not forget that presence of your troops there is illegitimate,” he added. “They\u0027re there without a United Nations decision or an invitation from the Syrian government. We are there at the invitation of the Syrian government, so if the United States has decided to withdraw its contingent, that\u0027s good.”Mr Putin said there was “no reason” for the United States to imprison Maria Butina, who admitted this week to acting as a Russian agent when she helped make connections with conservative activists and politicians, including Donald Trump Jr. “I can say for sure that she didn\u0027t execute any state tasks, whatever she may have said under the threat of 12 to 15 years in prison,” he said. “I don\u0027t understand why they imprisoned her, there was no reason. We\u0027ll see how it ends. We are not indifferent to this.”How to dodge a question. Russia Today asked Putin about the Skripal case, but didn\u0027t mention the suspects accused of the Salisbury poisoning. The president previously claimed they were civilians, but documents and former neighbours have indicated they were in military intelligence.  “This is a politicised Russophobic approach, it\u0027s just an excuse to organise another attack on Russia, if weren\u0027t the Skripals I\u0027m sure they would have thought up something else to contain Russia\u0027s\u0027 development,” Mr Putin responded and moved on without addressing his dubious previous claim. Mr Putin said there were currently no plans for a prisoner exchange for the Ukrainian sailors captured in the Kerch strait last month.Kiev\u0027s intermediary Viktor Medvedchuk came to Moscow recently and asked about the possibility of freeing them. I said this question can\u0027t be decided until the criminal case against them is brought to an end,” he said.Mr Putin blasted Washington for its intention to withdraw from the intermediate nuclear forces treaty and warned that another key arms agreement with the United States would come to an end in 2021. Russia has been forced to develop new nuclear weapons “that don\u0027t exist elsewhere in the world” to preserve strategic parity, he said.  “We will survive, we will guarantee our security, but for humanity this is very bad. It brings us closer to the edge,” he said.  He also slammed the development of tactical warheads in the West as a “tendency for nuclear threshold to be lowered.”Focusing on Russia\u0027s economy, which until recently was in recession due to low oil prices and sanctions, Mr Putin has said GDP growth this year will be 1.72 per cent.He called on Russia to “enter a new league” and become the fifth-largest economy in the world, an “achievable goal”. It is currently outside the top 10.Journalists are competing to get Mr Putin\u0027s attention by holding up eye-catching home-made signs.The editor of The Insider, a publication that participated in the initial investigations to uncover Chepiga and Mishkin\u0027s real names, was not allowed into the press conference despite having been accredited.Please review our commenting policyPolice call in the Army to help deal with Gatwick chaos as drones cause runway to close - live updatesNew species of big predator dinosaur found in marble quarry in ItalyBethlehem to launch app to control tourist crowds at Church of the NativityBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39Harvey Weinstein judge declines to dismiss #MeToo sexual assault case against him - live updatesUK funded inflatable operating theater set to revolutionise emergency surgery Scientists investigate upsurge in polio-like illness in childrenIndian police charge four with murder over poisoning plot at Indian temple that killed 15 devotees US \u0026#39will end airstrikes against Isil in Syria after American forces withdraw\u0026#39Labour MP convicted for lying to police over speeding offence compares her plight to Jesus and other biblical figuresPothole compensation quadruples in just one year as campaigners urge road bosses to fix problems \u0026#39ASAP\u0026#39Comment: Amber Rudd hasn\u0026#39t gone rogue.

But the SurgiBox, part funded by the Department for International Development, completely covers a patient and provides a sealed, hygienic area for doctors to work in.“It’s incredibly exciting because SurgiBox creates the opportunity to make safe surgery accessible,” the inventor, Dr Debbie Lin Teodorescu, told The . “It’s not just a good operating room, but a better than state-of-the-art operating room.”The idea is to shrink a whole operating theatre into one backpack. The tent-like enclosure is made of single-use, clear plastic to ensure no cross contamination between operations. A rechargeable battery inflates the SurgiBox in less than two minutes and powers the airflow system to keep it sterile. Once the tent is inflated doctors can work on the patient through armholes. The whole kit weighs less than five kilograms and fits into a 30 litre backpack. Although it can be used for any operation, including caesareans, it has been designed mainly for chest, abdominal and pelvic procedures which are most common in the field. The designers of SurgiBox, which costs as little as £100 to manufacture, say it is a significant improvement on the current drapes used in the field, but at a similar price. It also protects health workers from blood splatters and other bodily fluids. “But our system doesn’t rely on having anything . You don’t even need an operating table. It means surgery can happen anywhere, she added. SurgiBox has been seven years in the making and the current model is the sixth design. Dr Teodorescu came up with the idea while at medical school, after her supervisor told her about the challenges of performing surgery following the Haiti earthquake. The kit has the potential to revolutionise healthcare in conflict zones and humanitarian disasters“As an idealistic student, I thought this seemed insane,” said Dr Teodorescu, “So I started working with the idea of a transportable surgical box, like a glove box. The idea has changed since then, but that’s where the name came from.” But although the design is yet to be piloted in the field, the SurgiBox team hopes to receive regulatory approval for trials by the end of next year. The process will be aided by a US $250,000 (£200,000) grant from the Humanitarian Grand Challenge fund, a joint venture between the UK, US and Netherlands governments. SurgiBox is one of 23 innovations supported by the fund, which will invest a total of £25 million in projects over the next two years. “UK aid is at the cutting edge of research and innovation that will change the way that emergency surgery is delivered in conflict and disaster zones, allowing safe, effective surgery any place, any time,” said Penny Mordaunt, international development secretary. “This is one of several projects from the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, which I initiated with my counterparts at USAID to support and nurture ideas which will allow us to deliver aid more effectively in the future.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security ​Department for International DevelopmentPolice call in the Army to help deal with Gatwick chaos as drones cause runway to close - live updatesNew species of big predator dinosaur found in marble quarry in ItalyBethlehem to launch app to control tourist crowds at Church of the NativityBrexit latest news: Ministers in war of words after Amber Rudd says second referendum could be \u0026#39plausible\u0026#39Harvey Weinstein judge declines to dismiss #MeToo sexual assault case against him - live updatesScientists investigate upsurge in polio-like illness in childrenIndian police charge four with murder over poisoning plot at Indian temple that killed 15 devotees US \u0026#39will end airstrikes against Isil in Syria after American forces withdraw\u0026#39Putin calls for better UK-Russia relations at massive annual press conferenceLabour MP convicted for lying to police over speeding offence compares her plight to Jesus and other biblical figuresPothole compensation quadruples in just one year as campaigners urge road bosses to fix problems \u0026#39ASAP\u0026#39Comment: Amber Rudd hasn\u0026#39t gone rogue.

Such are the perils of learning a language without ever speaking it.“Eventually, if you want to learn a language, you usually speak to a human being,” says Witte. It\u0027s an unusual position, given Witte is a co-founder of Babbel, the highest grossing language-learning app. Did he really just say that\u0026nbspto learn a language, you need to do it in person?“Yes of course! There’s no denying that. But that doesn’t mean the app doesn’t make a lot of sense.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHow millennials are breathing fresh life into the Irish languageThe funniest words in the English language, from boff to coochRob Delaney to deliver first CBeebies Bedtime Story in sign languageFrom busuu, to Babbel to the UK-based Memrise, language-learning apps have proved big business. DuoLingo claims to have the most users, at 300 million. Babbel doesn\u0027t release user numbers but says it signed up 1 million US users in the last year. Thanks to its subscription model, Babbel\u0026nbspis the top grossing language app. Its US sales alone rose 140 per cent in the second half of 2017. Paying users rose by 40 per cent in the second half of 2017 in the US, up from 40,000 last August, overtaking Europe.In a bid to help people get out and practise their skills with real humans, Babbel has announced that it will start offering language-learning holidays. It has acquired Berlin startup LingoVentura, which handles bookings for 200 language schools in over 100 cities and countries.Babbel users will be able to find these language-learning holidays through a separate part of the app, Witte says. Backstage at TechCrunch Disrupt, a tech conference in Berlin, he\u0026nbspadded: “We don’t want to interrupt the learning journey, because it’s not an advertising tool, but we will make sure that if you want this kind of service you can find it.”Babbel has come a long way since it was founded in 2007 by Witte and Thomas Holl, two software engineers with no experience in languages. “When we started out trying to build a better language learning website in 2007, pre App store, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into,” Witte says. “We were three arrogant tech guys saying, this problem is already solved, how hard can it be?”A free iteration of Babbel went online in January 2008 and attracted investors alongside startup funding from the European Structural Fund. But Witte quickly detected an important problem: “You couldn’t learn a language with the thing we had built.”The engineers had built a vocabulary trainer and given it a user-friendly interface. They learned two things: “One, that you would never learn a language off that, and two, you would never make money off it.”So they rebuilt the app from scratch and started asking people to pay. Babbel charges between €12.99 (£12) and €8.25 (£7.35)\u0026nbsp a month, depending on how long users sign up for, unlike its biggest competitor, DuoLingo, which is free.\u0026nbsp“DuoLingo is free, and that’s their problem,” Witte says. “We’ve been there. It’s hard to make money with a free product. I’m not talking about becoming filthy rich, I’m talking about paying your freaking bills! And making sure your people can pay their bills.”Mea Culpa: what is your alibi? Language is changing, your honourAt the same time, Babbel rethought its approach to language learning. Rather than thinking of it as a tech problem, they began to think of it as a human problem. “You can’t substitute the hundreds of years of research and experience that there is in language learning with technology without even looking,” Witte says. “We did that, so I am totally guilty of it. We also made the humble move to say, we were wrong.”Babbel now employs 700 staff, including many language experts. “Tech matters - all the founders are tech people,” Witte says. “We’re totally excited about machine learning and all the fancy stuff out there, but in time we realised that these are just tools. We can be excited about them, but it’s the way you use them that matters.”Babbel originally set out to build an adaptive language learning tool, with exercises put together by machines. But machines aren’t as good at teaching languages as humans and they can throw out random phrases. “Randomness is what as a language learner is pretty off-putting,” Witte says. “So we use stories.”Babbel is using tech to experiment\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspadapting stories without breaking them. The idea is for\u0026nbsptwo people to be able to invest different amounts of time in learning a language and still have a consistent human story to guide them. The tech is used to adapt the programme to the speed of the learner.\u0026nbspThe missing piece of the jigsaw for Babbel is the ability to help the user learn to speak, or to move beyond reading Flaubert and into ordering breakfast. But while Babbel has embraced language holidays, it has no plans to move fully offline and into language schools, Witte says. “We don’t want to get into the language school business, we are not disruptive, we don’t want to eat anyone else’s lunch,” he says. “Many of them are very small, family run and offer a very personal service. To replicate that personal element is very tough at scale and might not be what we’re good at.”Instead, holidays offer a chance for app-users to try out simple conversations that they have practised on the app. Witte remembers using Babbel to learn a few phrases in Turkish before going to a restaurant to order a doner kebab. “They laughed at me, of course they did, but they appreciated the effort,” he says. “It felt good, and that’s the kicker that keeps you going. If you never speak the language, it’s hard to learn.”He adds: “The app can bring you pretty far, but machines are\u0026nbspnot\u0026nbsphuman and never will be. If there is one thing that makes us human, it’s language.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about. One week before Christmas, Margaret, the gorgeous Duchess of Montenaro, switches places with Stacy, a “commoner” from Chicago, who looks exactly like her. With the assistance of a magical Santa\u0027s helper, Margaret falls in love with Stacy’s handsome co-worker, while Stacy falls in love with Margaret\u0027s fiance, the dashing Prince.A struggling but talented photographer inherits an antique holiday advent calendar, the contents of which seem to predict the future. Will this magical calendar lead her to love this holiday season?

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”Gustave ​​Doré (Alamy)These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”Alston: Poverty UK\u0027s \u0027biggest challenge\u0027 and\u0026nbspMPs are in \u0027state of denial\u0027 about itWhat frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.’ William Cook meets the artisan at her Hampstead homeClick to followThe IndependentThe French creative tried to fit her art around business for nearly 30 yearsIn Gainsborough’s House in Sudbury, where Britain’s greatest portrait artist was born and raised, there’s a bust of that great artist which captures his personality as well any painting. His expression is quizzical. There’s a\u0026nbsphint of mischief in his eyes. Seeing it for the first time you might suppose it was made 250 years ago – the result of numerous painstaking sittings. In fact, it was made just a few years ago, by the sculptor Nicole Farhi.Nicole Farhi, sculptor? Wait a minute – I thought she was a fashion designer? Well, yes and no. It’s true that she made her reputation with her chic yet comfy clothes, but although her name remains a byword for casual elegance she’s not involved in fashion anymore. Instead she’s making sculpture now, full-time, and in February she has a new show at Gainsborough’s House, in Suffolk, where her Gainsborough bust has pride of place.I know nothing about fashion, but I liked that Gainsborough bust a lot. It was conscientious and unpretentious. The focus was on the subject not the sculptor, the way such sculptures ought to be. So when my friend Tracy wangled me an invite to Farhi’s Hampstead home, I jumped at the chance to meet her. I wanted to find out if her new career as a sculptor was for real. I wanted to know if that Gainsborough bust was just a one-off.She meets me in the doorway of her Georgian house. You wouldn’t know she’s 72. Her huge mane of wavy hair is as thick and wild as ever. Her eyes are bright. Her skin is clear. She’s dressed simply, in white pumps, blue jeans and a blue jumper. On anyone else her age, these plain clothes would look dowdy. On her, they’re stylish. How does she pull it off? A pointless question, no need to ask. She’s a famous fashion designer, after all.She was also an interior designer – everything from furnishing to kitchenware – and so, as you’d expect, her home is pretty stylish too: lots of brightly coloured drapes lots of paintings on the walls lots of books and classy bric-a-brac, and lots of sculptures too. She shows me a bust she made of a friend, sculpted when he was in deep despair, a face misshapen with pain and grief. “He looked so torn – his wife had left him.”\u0026nbspIt’s a world away from her Gainsborough bust, so discreet and delicate by comparison. I never knew her work had such range. I’m pleasantly surprised. I’m also quite impressed.Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarOf course it’s terribly unfair, as I know all too well. My mother is a sculptor, about the same age as Nicole. She’s been slogging away throughout her life, ever since art school, and has never broken through. Yet no one’s life is easy. Nicole’s fame has opened doors, but those doors would soon close again if the work wasn’t any good. Britons distrust polymaths and are suspicious of second careers. It may be a bit easier for Nicole to get to first base with her sculpture. It may be a lot harder for her to get beyond second base.It’s not as if sculpture is a newfound fancy. She’s been hard at it for over half her life – 37 years. She shows me a small torso, the first sculpture she ever made. As she holds it in her hand she tells me how she came to make it. She’d gone to see the sculptor Jean Gibson, to ask if she could be her pupil. “I’ll only take you if you have something to say – otherwise, it’s a waste of time,”\u0026nbspsaid Jean as\u0026nbspshe handed Nicole a piece of clay. Jean told Nicole to sculpt a torso, there and then. When Nicole had finished, Jean took a good look at it. “I’m taking you on – come back on Wednesday,” she\u0026nbspsaid.Farhi also sculpts hands and torsos (Walter van Dyk)“I went to my car and I burst into tears – I was so emotional,”\u0026nbsprecalls Nicole. “You see a door opening to another world. I’m emotional just to think about it.”\u0026nbspAs she retells the story, her eyes well up with tears.It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to changeNo, this is no passing fad. “It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.”\u0026nbspFor over 30 years she had to fit her sculpture around fashion, but then in 2012, she walked away. “Now I sculpt every day.”She takes me to her studio, an orangery\u0026nbspin the garden. There are rows and rows of busts in here, of famous friends: Bill Nighy, Judi Dench, Anna Wintour, Wallace Shawn, Stephen Frears… these busts are full of character. She sculpts hands too, and the torsos of voluptuous women, some of which will be shown at the Beaux Arts London gallery in January. “Large women are beautiful – flesh is wonderful!”\u0026nbspshe exclaims.\u0026nbspThese Rubenesque women are a world away from the models she used to work with during her previous career. “It’s about the sensuality of the flesh, the beauty that large women have,”\u0026nbspshe says. “For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybody.”The artist in her orangery-turned-studio (Julian Jans)Discovering sculpture later on in life has made her determined not to waste a moment. “I don’t have 50 years in front of me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I work every single day, but I don’t mind. I’m so happy that I have been able to stop fashion and just sculpt.”\u0026nbspShe loved art from an early age, and used to paint while she was a student, but when she was young she preferred the whirlwind of the fashion world to the isolation of the artist, so she’s philosophical about the time she’s lost.“Maybe I would not have been serious enough as artist then,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Sculpture is a much slower pace. I can take it now. Probably at the age of 20 I could not.”\u0026nbspAfter 40 years in fashion, she relishes her new seclusion. “I don’t miss the world of fashion at all. I’m very happy on my own here.”For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybodyShe was born in 1946 in Nice, the second of two children. Her parents were Sephardic Jews, immigrants from Turkey. There was no art in her childhood home. “None whatsoever.”\u0026nbspHer father was a gentle man who saw the best in everyone. He sold carpets for a living. “The house was full of rugs.”Her father sounds a bit too nice to be a terribly successful businessman, but she adored him all the same. “My mother always fought with him because she thought he was too kind,”\u0026nbspshe says, “but he was at peace with it – he was a wise man.”\u0026nbspHer relationship with her mother was more fiery, but her mother had more of an artistic sensibility than her father (“my dad never understood what I was doing”) and it was her mother who enabled her to go to Paris to study fashion – her father wanted her to stay at home.One of the reasons she chose to study fashion was because there were no fashion schools close to home. “Nice was a very small town,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I was dreaming of the capital.”\u0026nbspIn Paris, she soon made her mark, not by impressing her tutors but by cold-calling fashion houses, from public telephones in corner cafes, and asking to show them her drawings and designs. For an unknown teenager, that must have taken a lot of confidence, I say. “There was no other way,”\u0026nbspshe replies. “I didn’t think I had anything to lose.”It was in Paris, in 1972, that she met the founder of French Connection, the London fashion retailer Stephen Marks (“a fabulous businessman”). They started working together, became a couple, and had a child together – a daughter, Candice, now a photographic agent in America.‘Flesh is wonderful,’ Farhi says of her subjects (Walter van Dyk)For a few years, Nicole remained in Paris with Candice, but eventually, she decided it would be best for Candice to go to school in Britain, so when Candice was four she brought her to London.She’s lived here ever since, but she still feels French rather than British (she still speaks with a strong French accent) and the clothes that she designed brought a continental flair to British fashion. Yet she had no game plan, no grand design.She was simply doing what came naturally. “I only did what I felt was right for me. I designed looser clothes because that’s what I liked wearing. I didn’t do very short dresses, because I didn’t think that was nice, to look at a girl and only see the thighs – when she’s dressed, of course. When she’s naked it’s a different thing!”Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi sculptures – in pictures  Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 What was it like working with the father of her only child? “It was good and bad because we argued a lot at work,”\u0026nbspshe says. “We were fighting a lot.”\u0026nbspIn the end, they separated, but they kept on working together. “And then things changed completely. We had the best relationship working together once we were not living together, and now we’re still very, very close friends. We had a lot of respect for each other, which we never lost. I think he helped me tremendously at becoming who I was.”\u0026nbspThey’re still close today.In 1992 Nicole married the playwright David Hare, with whom she shares this splendid house. It sounds like love at first sight, and, from the way she talks about him, it sounds as if their love has never faded. Yet they might so easily have never met. Nicole had designed some costumes for Hare’s play, Murmuring Judges, and was invited to the first night party. Yet she had no intention of going until she saw Hare on TV the night before. “He went straight to my heart!”\u0026nbspshe says. Entranced and intrigued, she went to the party, and he made a beeline for her table. “It was the same for him!”The artist working on a bust of Bill Nighy, just one of her famous friends (Julian Jans)“You should have started earlier,”\u0026nbspHare said when he saw her sculptures. Maybe she should have met him earlier, too. When she was a fashion student in Paris, Hare was studying at the Sorbonne. They both used to skip classes to go to the movies, at the same cinemas, and yet their paths never crossed. “We could have been younger, had kids together,”\u0026nbspshe muses. Yet, as she says, quite rightly, there’s no point in crying over what you’ve missed.While Nicole sculpts in the orangery, David writes in his own studio just down the road. For two creative artists in their early 70s, it sounds like an idyllic life. “We don’t meet during the day – he doesn’t come home for lunch,” she says. But they’re obviously besotted with each other. Clearly, a little absence makes the heart grow fonder as the years ebb away.Artist uses robots to create stunning \u0027classical\u0027 sculptures16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarFor the last seven years, they’ve shared the house with Nicole’s mother, who moved in with them at the grand old age of 95. For Nicole, it was a poignant epilogue to a long and turbulent relationship. “She did tell me, perhaps for the first time in her life, when she was 101, that she loved me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Because we fought so much, I was never sure.”\u0026nbspShe died six months ago, aged 102. Nicole shows me the bust she made of her, looking feisty and defiant, but the sculpture that really moves me is of her frail little hand, cast when she was 100.Stephen Marks sold the Nicole Farhi label in 2010. Nicole carried on working there, but it was never quite the same. She left a couple of years later. “I hoped one day I would stop, but I had no idea when that would be. It was only when my company was sold that I realised that was my way out.”\u0026nbspFor her, it was a liberation. When Nicole Farhi went into administration the following year she felt oddly detached from the brand that still bears her name. “It was not upsetting at all,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I could not wait to leave.”No matter. Sculpture is what she does now, and she’s determined not to look back. As she shows me out, she stops to show me the bust of her friend and mentor, the great Italian-Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. “He opened my eyes to everything,”\u0026nbspshe tells me, as we say goodbye. It’s a supremely expressive sculpture, full of life and love and suffering. There are several others I like a lot, but for me, this is the pick of the bunch. Before I met her, I couldn’t quite understand why she’d turned her back on fashion, but now I know she was right to do so. Nicole Farhi used to be a brilliant fashion designer, but that was then and this is now.

If it fails to do so, then I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues.”Her intervention\u0026nbspwas hailed as a “massive moment” by People’s Vote campaigners, with Tory former minister Anna Soubry describing it as brave and principled.However Ms Leadsom\u0026nbspdismissed her comments outright as she said a fresh vote would be unacceptable.The Commons leader told the\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme: It\u0027s not government policy.I myself think it would undermine the biggest democratic exercise ever, where we had a clear majority to leave the European Union.To have a second referendum would unfortunately be going back to people and telling them they have got it wrong and they needed to try again. I think it would be unacceptable.Ms Leadsom\u0026nbspconfirmed she had been considering plans for a no-deal Brexit, which is the default position if parliament cannot come to some kind of agreement.She said she was looking at a managed no-deal, which some Brexiteers favour, as an alternative solution if the prime minister\u0027s deal is vote down.A managed no-deal does not necessarily mean there is no withdrawal agreement at all,\u0026nbspMs\u0026nbspLeadsom\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This is all speculation, but what I am looking at is trying to find an alternative that, in the event we cannot agree to this deal, that there could be a further deal that looks at a more minimalist approach that allows us to leave with some kind of deal and some kind of implementation period that avoids a cliff edge, that avoids uncertainty for businesses and travellers and so on.It comes as Ms May was due to meet her\u0026nbspPolish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki for talks in London, as she desperately seeks further reassurances from EU leaders about controversial backstop plan\u0026nbspbefore the crunch Commons vote in the week of January 14.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The UK would then stay in the EU and there would be no change to its current relationship.When is the last date Article 50 can be revoked?\u0026nbspMajor calls for Article 50 to be revoked ‘with immediate effect’The ECJ ruled that revocation can happen within the two year negotiating period, or any extension to it. So the current last possible date is 29 March 2019, when Britain is set to leave – but it could be extended further if the 27 other EU countries unanimously decide to grant an extension.\u0026nbspAdditionally, if a withdrawal agreement somehow comes in earlier, then revocation would not be possible from that point – though this appears unlikely for the UK given the current course of events.Does it need approval by the EU?No approval from any EU institution or member state is needed – the ability to revoke Article 50 is the departing member state’s alone.\u0026nbspIronically, given some of the arguments at the referendum, the ECJ ruled this is because under EU law the withdrawal process “reflects a sovereign decision to retain its status as a member state of the European Union, a status which is neither suspended nor altered by that notification”.Who can ask for revocation: the parliament, the government, the prime minister?\u0026nbspThe ECJ says the decision to withdraw the notification has to be made in line with the country’s “own national constitutional requirements” – whatever they may be.Details of post-Brexit immigration policy under wraps until 2020Given the UK Supreme Court ruled that Article 50 could only be triggered with a vote of parliament, it is quite likely that it would need to be revoked by a vote of parliament. The court’s advocate general said in his recommendation that it was “logical that the revocation of that notification also requires parliamentary approval” given it was required to trigger the process.\u0026nbspThe government’s lawyers appear to have conceded this point: in their submission to the ECJ during the course of this case they said parliament must have “directed the government” to withdraw Article 50.However, neither of these strong indications actually make it law. Given what’s riding on the question and the ambiguity of the UK constitution, there is likely to be a legal challenge no matter what happens. Only then will we be absolutely certain. But it’s probably a parliamentary vote.\u0026nbspAre there any constraints, and does a reason have to be given?No reason has to be given. The advocate general’s opinion prior to the judgment said member states could not use Article 50 notification and revocation as an “abusive practice” – and they have to be acting in good faith. There was no mention of this in the final ruling, but the court did say the withdrawal had to be based on an “unequivocal and unconditional decision”.\u0026nbspCan this be used to temporarily postpone or suspend withdrawal?No, or at least not officially. The text of Article 50 spells out a formal process for extending the Article 50 negotiating period, and that requires a unanimous vote of the European Council. As mentioned above, the revocation has to be an “unequivocal and unconditional decision”.However, once the UK has revoked Article 50, there would be nothing stopping it from deciding to leave again. So this would be quite difficult to police, and in practice it could potentially be used to reset the two year negotiating period. This would probably make other\u0026nbspEU member states, and officials, extremely angry however.Would anything else have to be done to stop Britain leaving the EU?As far as EU law is concerned, no. But there is also the matter of UK statute law, which enshrines the exit date in domestic legislation. The status of this is a matter of debate – though given a Commons majority would be required to revoke Article 50, further votes would probably be a formality.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Like it or loathe it, Vladimir Putin’s annual press-conference creates headlines.\u0026nbspThe 14th edition of this carefully-managed show was no exception, with Vladimir Putin unexpectedly throwing his weight behind Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plans.\u0026nbsp“The referendum happened,” he said. “What can she do? She should fulfil the will of her nation, as expressed at the referendum. Or it isn’t a referendum.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Kremlin has been accused of attempting to influence the initial Brexit vote, but that did not deter the Russian president from warning against a second people’s vote.\u0026nbspNot to implement Brexit now would be to repudiate “direct democracy,” he said: “Is it democracy not to care about this Brexit and continue voting until someone is happy with the result?”Overall, Mr Putin presented little in the way of a new agenda. As in previous episodes of the press conference, he said Russia’s economy was resilient, the outside world was aggressive, Ukraine was blinkering on collapse, and his watch would eventually deliver a “technological breakthrough.”\u0026nbspYes, things weren’t always great, but they had been worse, he said. Yes, there was sluggish growth. But ten years ago, in the midst of crisis, there was negative growth!\u0026nbspSanctions? What of it? Russia has faced sanctions throughout history. This time, Russia was more than coping. It was the West that is really losing.\u0026nbsp“Just look at Spain! They have 15pc unemployment while we have 3.8pc!And what of the disease-ridden landfill sites that have so enraged working class Russians in recent months? Russia would build new recycling plants, but there are “entire islands of rubbish in the Pacific Ocean”! \u0026nbspIt almost seemed that Mr Putin was bored and irritated with the format. He only really became engaged when talking about nuclear weapons.\u0026nbspThere was a repeat of promises to build Russia’s strategic arsenal. This, he said, was a response to the US decision to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, and their apparent intention not to renew another cold war arms treaty.\u0026nbsp“The risks of a nuclear war are growing and underestimated,” he said. “People shouldn’t squeak when we try to add capacity. We aren’t adding capacity, we are preserving balance”\u0026nbspOn the main metric of the yearly show - the number of hours journalists are kept inside without food or water - this year fell somewhat short of the record. The press conference lasted just under 4 hours, or 50 minutes short of the 2008 show. \u0026nbspBut it was a record on the attendance count, with 1700 journalists packed inside the hall. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov made a point of declaring that his staff had gone out of their way to assist foreign journalists in accreditation — unlike the British, he said, who were causing trouble for RT.\u0026nbspOnly those with a criminal record, or “with various illnesses” had been denied accreditation, Mr Peskov said.\u0026nbspAccreditation was not, however, an automatic guarantee of entry. At least one journalist was turned away at the doors of the hall despite possessing the golden hologrammed card. In Roman Dobrokhotov’s case, his crime of identifying the two GRU agents accused of the Skripal poisoning seems to have played against him.\u0026nbspOne affliction that did not bar entry to the hall is Putinmania.\u0026nbspThroughout the event, journalists were encouraged to shriek to gain the ruler’s attention. Some came in fancy dress to stand out (think hockey gear, snow maiden outfits and regional costume). Others bore placards with the name of their region, publication or something more abstract (e.g.: I\u0027m from the future. Ask me what it\u0027s like there).\u0026nbspAlmost on cue, they applauded the president, booed\u0026nbspany question that could be deemed too hostile, and lobbed in their own softballs.\u0026nbspSome of the zingers served up today included an offer to go skiing, a long-winded New Years’ greeting, and a simple “how he was feeling?”\u0026nbspAs usual, the most interesting questions were the ones that went unanswered and unasked. \u0026nbspThe president sidestepped a question about the role of Yevgeny Prizhozhin, a shady associate accused of creating troll farms and private armies, and who has been nicknamed the “president’s chef” on account of his propensity to win state catering contracts.\u0026nbspCabinet splits laid bare as Rudd says new referendum is \u0027plausible\u0027“My only cooks are employees of the presidential security service,” the president said.Mr Putin then whataboutised the deaths of three journalists in Central African Republic, ignoring questions about Mr Prigozhin’s alleged role in the affair. “Journalists are killed in Ukraine too,” he said.\u0026nbspThere was no mention about what happened to the two men Mr Putin personally presented as “ordinary Russian citizens,” but later identified as military intelligence agents Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That would not have changedshe lost and the Tories picked a new leader.And whatever Jeremy Corbyn says, it wouldn’t changethere was an election and he moved into Number  either.You can’t rule anything out for certain, but most MPs reckon an election is the most unlikely outcome of all.That’s why calling a vote of confidence in the government is a waste of time. Tory MPs won’t risk it and the Ulster Unionists know they will never be more powerful.Anyway, Jeremy told Labour MPs to trigger Article  and set the clock ticking down to departure in March. There isn’t time for an election, the public expect MPs to sort it out and there’s no guarantee it would solve the problem.I asked Jeremy this week what his policy would bethere was an election: would he campaign to stay in, promise another referendum or, after campaigning against the EU for decades, uphold the referendum - but he refused to give any answer at all.And who can be certain he’d win  He should be miles ahead in the polls, but when asked who would make the best Prime Minister, the public still back Theresa May. In fact, in a two-horse race, he comes a distant third behind don’t know.Jeremy seems to think he could negotiate to stay in the single market and customs union, but stop paying our contributions and still have a say over the rules. Who thinks we could get all the benefits without paying a penny Imagine asking to use a gym but refusing to join or even pay – and wanting a say in how it’s run!Let’s face facts: the EU isn’t waiting to give a dferent Prime Minister a better deal. Whether it’s Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, they won’t roll over and give us everything we want.It’s not only Theresa May who says it. Nor even just Juncker. Merkel says the deal can’t be changed.Macron and Ireland’s Taoiseach say so too. Not one EU leader said they are open to renegotiating it.In , % of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Labour heartlands like Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bolsover, Wakefield or Doncaster all voted leave. Here in the West Midlands, people voted to leave in some of the highest numbers of all.In , our manesto promised to uphold the referendum – no s, no buts, no second referendum.Ordinary, decent people who voted leave believed us. Lots of people voted leave to make politicians sit up and listen.With trust in politics at an all-time low, we can’t discount that lightly. Another referendum would take months and there’s no agreement on what the questions would be.I’ve listened to lots of people in Dudley and there’s not much evidence people have changed their minds. Eventhey had, who thinks a narrow remain vote would settle it That’s why I think our choice is between Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all. I joined the Labour Party to fight for ordinary people and their jobs must come first.This week I met Jaguar Land Rover, a world-beating British company employing , British workers.Like manufacturers up and down the country they believe a no deal Brexit would threaten their business and the jobs of people who depend on it.Delays at ports will cost jobs. Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Getting rid of it is going to take some work.But the predictions of apocalyptic job losses  Instant recession  We’ve heard the doomsday predictions before.Wrong then, wrong now.There is one thing we are sure of, though, never more so than this week.If we believe in ourselves we have nothing to fear.TOO many of our brave Armed Forces find themselves in tough times when they get back to Civvy Street.So the NHS is dead right to prioritise their care — especially their mental health.Veterans have put their lives on the line for us and it’s only right that we put everything we’ve got into giving back to them.Ensuring they are in good shape, in body and brain, will help our brave boys and girls find jobs, homes and families.It will go a long way to fixing the national disgrace of homeless ex-soldiers.They are the best of us. Britain must take care of them.GARETH Southgate is richly deserving of an honour.And it’s as much for what he does off the pitch as he ever did playing for, or managing, England.He is generous with his time for charities, a fine example for youngsters, and is one of the most eloquent champions of our brilliant, erse, modern Britain.Here’s to you, Gareth.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year.

It’s a Remainer ruse. Except it’s worse than remaining. Norway Plus, aka “Remain Minus”, would destroy the Tories as surely as simply scrapping Brexit.It is far more likely to do so than any number of “no-confidence” stunts like the one Jeremy Corbyn has now pulled in his pathetic desperation for relevance.If Theresa May’s withdrawal deal fails — and Remainer Cabinet ministers would rather sacrice Brexit than swallow a No Deal — they’ll just have to quit.It’s not much of a threat. We doubt voters will miss them.SO much for the “clf-edge No Deal apocalypse” of hysterical Remainer fantasy. The EU now plans to ensure le there and here carries on normally after March .It will keep planes flying, goods and money flowing and traffic moving freely from Dover to Calais. Great.Given all that — and the fact the EU has no intention of even meeting about Mrs May’s deal, let alone improving it — let’s just take them at their word.No Deal is legally our default position.

And some reality TV stars set a good example, just as some of our more traditional public figures leave a lot to be desired.It seemed to me that Love Island winners Jack and Dani were quite a moral couple. They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Often his urban exploring adventures require weeks of planning just to reach such places.Sometimes it has involved sneaking past security and the adrenaline filled adventures are documented in his book Exploring the Unbeaten Path.Here we feature Bob’s top ten abandoned locations which share impressive sights many will never get a chance to see in real le.The select few range from a Scottish oil rig to the chilling remnants of Fukushima, space shuttle military bases, theme parks reclaimed by nature, and more.Bob said: “These locations are well preserved, have natural decay, a lot of history and you can spend days in there without getting bored.“They are the coolest locations I have visited in the past decade.“Urban exploring is a nice way to discover the world.

Often these buildings are heritage.“Its full of adrenaline and adventure, every trip is another adventure and you never know what will happen and where you will end up.“Its some kind of off the beaten path tourism.”Placing at number ten, was Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia, USA, a former prison where medical experiments were claimed to have been conducted on detainees between  – .For number nine, Bob selected the many abandoned castles he had visited, particularly those hidden away from vandals deep in the woods or out of sight.Battleship Island, in Japan, claimed number eight, which was bought by Mitsubishi to extract coal from the sea and an articial city arose.In seventh, was Glück Kingdom, an amusement park based on German designs and buildings, including tributes to Brothers Grimm and their chilling fairy tales.In sixth place, was Nara Dreamland an impressive Disney-inspired amusement park in Japan.Claiming fth position, was a discarded army ing boat off the coast of Portugal, the secret location left them battling with security.Bob considers ship The Colbert to be number four, which has remained in a French port.It was destined to be scrapped until the s when it was converted into a museum, since closing  years ago, new plans are in place to demolish it.In third place was an abandoned oil rig off the Scottish coast of Cromarty Firth, which he and other explorers visited for a weekend.In second place was Fukushima, for its haunting remains of areas where residents according to Bob went “head over heels”.He believes the site is just about bad as it was seven years ago after the nuclear power plant accident.But topping all others for the urban explorer was an abandoned military base that contained space shuttles.Bob spent three days in the dessert in order to reach the location, which he admits was by far the hardest of his adventures, yet the most rewarding.Bob became fascinated with old, history-rich locations that had been forgotten during his teen years.Eventually he would go onto start the YouTube series, Exploring the Unbeaten Path, to document his travels."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457273726.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn stupid woman theresa may pm questions","story":"In scenes of chaos in the Commons, Tory MPs accused the Labour leader of muttering the slur during PM’s Questions.Mr Corbyn was later dragged back to explain himself.He was ridiculed as he astonishingly insisted he had actually said “stupid people” — despite lip readers suggesting otherwise.Mrs May said Mr Corbyn should apologise.She said: “In the year in which we celebrate  years since women got the vote, I want to see more women encouraged to come into Parliament and not put off by the sorts of remarks they might feel have been said in Parliament.“I think the Speaker made very clear thata member of parliament uses inappropriate language that they should apologise.”She had infuriated Mr Corbyn with a panto-style dig mocking his on-off threat of tabling a no confidence vote in her Government.Expert lip readers told The Sun he reacted by uttering: “Stupid woman”.Tina Lannin, director of lipreading service  Captions said: “Each of the four lipreaders said their conclusion is  per cent ‘stupid woman’.“The lip pattern for P and W are both dferent so there is no doubt on this one.”Images of his comment during PM’s Questions spread like wildfire through the packed Commons after being posted on social media.Mr Corbyn scuttled out of the Chamber as Tory big beast Patrick McLoughlin demanded he apologise.Furious Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the “public would draw their own conclusions”.The real measure of him is that he fled the Commons before he could be called to account for it — then made up a cock-and-bull story to avoid being forced to apologise once he was summoned back.This is the coward and liar Labour want to install in No.But the party’s venality gets worse.Because when Speaker John Bercow was himself then accused of calling a Tory ­“stupid woman”, Labour Remainer Margaret Beckett stood up for him and hollered at the Tory benches.Not for her the solidarity shown by other female MPs across the House. ­Oh no.

Jeremy Corbyn’s abuse of the Prime Minister shows what a reactionary misogynist he is.”Labour veteran Dame Margaret Beckett had tried to defend Mr Corbyn by saying the Tories were guilty of trying to mount an “orchestrated riot”.But Labour’s Jess Philips had earlier admitted thatright the slur was “sexist” and Mr Corbyn “should apologise”.The Prime Minister had infuriated the Labour leader by mocking his on-off threat of tabling a no confidence vote in her Government.To roars of laughter, she said: “I have some advice for the right hon.

Such a move, he added, would help those most at risk from a No Deal Brexit “to boost them as they transition”.We’re told in a doomsday No Deal ­scenario that all planes will be grounded and the country will be sold no medicines from abroad.It’s even claimed that our food exports will rot in lorries queued up at Dover, while we starve because no food is being imported via Calais, both of which seem unlikely to happen at the same time.To listen to some campaigners, you’d think there are only three kinds of ­relationship with the EU: Membership, paying the massive bills and swallowing endless laws from Brussels a big, one-size-fits-all deal or a smouldering ruin, cut off completely from trade or co-operation.It might be in their interests to pretend so, because they want to try to frighten us into accepting a poor deal or scare us into abandoning the idea of taking back control altogether. But it isn’t true.Most of the world aren’t EU members, after all, and many countries don’t have trade deals with the EU.Brussels’ rule-by-committee means that trade negotiations with the bloc are slow and have to satisfy a dizzying list of ­special interests.Of the deals that countries have struck with the EU,  dferent types have been hammered out.Anyone who claims there is no flexibility in how we manage our relationship after Brexit is not telling the whole story.But even beyond that, among the many countries who trade with the EU without a deal, the reality does not match up to the black-and-white claim that the choice is either full deal or No Deal.In real le, most countries are quite practical and have the power to reach a whole range of smaller agreements with one another that fall short of a trade deal but still bring benefits.They recognise each other’s driving licences or doctors’ qualications, allow mutual access to their air space, or agree to trust each other’s safety tests on goods rather than hold them up for costly extra testing at their ports.Why do they do it  Because it is in both sides’ interests for trade, tourism and le in general to flow as easily as possible.The US does it, the EU does it, every normal state does it — and there’s no ­reason why we and the EU couldn’t do it, too,it isn’t possible to reach a larger agreement for le after Brexit right now.As Theresa May is finding out, some issues might simply be too dficult or controversial for the UK or the EU to give ground on in the next few weeks.But that should not stop us from ­shaking hands on hundreds of other side deals that both sides could agree quite simply, and which would help both sides to square away.That’s what’s called a “managed no deal” — it might not be either our or their dream outcome but it would make le easier while work continues on overcoming the really dficult sticking points.What’s shocking is the way in which this practical approach has been widely ignored for political reasons.Some of the much-touted “worst-case scenario” forecasts for the supposed cost of Brexit rely on the ridiculous assumption that Brussels and Westminster would do literally nothing to reduce any potential problems from No Deal.We’ve been told repeatedly from some quarters that it is simply impossible for the EU to show any flexibility at all with a non-member, even though it has done so in ious cases.At long last, that lie is being exposed. Just as the UK has released its No Deal preparations, the EU is this week ­publishing details of how it would ­handle that situation.And guess what  Brussels wants to strike mutual side deals in which we both agree to respect ious aspects of each other’s rights in order to limit ­disruption and costs.It turns out there is a practical way ­forward after all, and the doom-mongers’ predictions should be taken with a hefty fistful of salt.Of course a good, wide-ranging, lasting deal is still desirable, and we should keep working to agree one.But there are things we can and should do in the meantime.Better that than be rushed into a ­permanent bad deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would seem they agree about nothing. As soon as one minister says something another clown will jump up and insist he’s wrong.It’s like being led by a bunch of hyperactive five-year-olds. If it wasn’t for the fact that the leader of the opposition is a cross between Catweazel and Trotsky we’d have got rid of them long ago.This time the argument is about immigration. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said there are no targets for reducing immigration. The PM immediately responded: “Oh yes there are, baldie.”For once, Theresa May is right. Immigration is a crucial issue and we have been promised time and again — by May herself — that it will be drastically reduced. That’s what the vast majority of the country wants. And the only sensible way to do it is by having targets. You know, something to aim at.We’ve put up with a lot from this Government, maybe too much. If they start backsliding on immigration, that will be it. Down to tens of thousands of people per year, please, as soon as possible. Uncontrolled immigration has made this country almost unrecognisable.We still need to import some talent from overseas. People with good skills and high qualications. What we don’t need are thousands of beggars shoving badly scrawled messages in your face saying “Money Give Now” on the Tube.Nor do we need the thousand upon thousand of unskilled workers picking fruit and veg. Here’s a tip, farmers — pay a decent wage and maybe a few British people will give those jobs a go, huh British businesses have exploited cheap foreign labour for far too long. And the result is an underclass of Eastern Europeans living in desperately squalid conditions, in appalling accommodation.It’s not THEIR fault, by any means. It’s the fault of an immoral system which has seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Cheap EU labour has meant that the wages of the very poorest Britons get undercut. Why on earth the Labour Party supports this exploitation is a total mystery to me.But the other real problem we have is immigration from outside the EU. This easily outnumbers those coming from Europe. I don’t just mean those who say they are refugees but are clearly economic migrants. Although Theresa May could do worse than pledge a halt to that influx, which continues.But we still let in thousands of people from all over the world. They come claiming their brother or cousin lives here and that should give them a right to our benefits and jobs.This has been going on for too long. And it is this immigration which has most changed the face of Britain, in a way many people resent.Here’s the deal, Theresa. Look at Belgium, where the government has just fallen because it ignored the country’s wishes on immigration. So get tough. Put Mr Javid back in his box and set a few realistic targets. Then get to grips with immigration full stop. And maybe we’ll all like you a bit more for it.SOME lesbians are furious.On Coronation Street, the lesbian character Kate Connor tried to seduce . . . a bloke.And the scene got a lot of lesbians up and down the country seething with rage.

Bob, for sure. The sponge with the Bob and the shorts ”At which point, things started getting even weirder for Gino on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show.A programme which, I realise, wasn’t the main television event of the weekend. That was the Strictly Come Dancing final.But so what  It’s Christmas, and after  months largely spent telling you what television shows I don’t like, it seems only fair to celebrate one that I do. Why Simple. Michael McIntyre is one of the very few comedians left on television who realises it’s his duty to make viewers laugh rather than bend and bully them into their left-wing point of view.A noble calling, obviously, but there’d be no point taking this mainstream approachthe resulting show was also cheesy, unprofessional and talked down to its audience.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show falls into none of those traps. Apart from being riotously funny, it’s also clever, charmingly savage at times and ided into three equally slick segments that can all carry an embarrassing musical interlude from Cheryl Tweedy, who stamped around, in elephant leggings, like a mad woman on Saturday’s show.They take it in turns to be the highlight of the show as well. A fortnight ago Bradley Walsh’s send-to-all stunt was the best bit.Last week it was the unexpected-star-of-the-show slot and, at the weekend, it was undoubtedly the Midnight Gameshow with Gino, who had eight stabs before sort of nailing: “SpongeBob with the square pants.”His torment was only just beginning, however, as he was then asked to ID the mystery celebrity singing in his shower.Easy in normal circumstances, but, right on cue, Gino had developed a: “First thing in the morning moment”, and had to shuffle next door with a pillow hiding his embarrassment.If he had the problem, though, Michael McIntyre definitely had the solution.“It’s Sinitta!” he yelled, killing the “first thing in the morning” problem stone dead, which was probably just as well, because he was hugging Boycie from Only Fools And Horses a second or two later.It wasn’t just Gino’s physical responses that were the making of this stunt, though, it was the fact that, having been presented with all this random madness, as well as a goat called Olivia, he asked the single best television question I’ve heard all year.“Are we live ”“LIVE ” responded McIntyre, barely able to contain himself. “It’s one in the morning, Gino.”It’s tempting, then, to describe the whole thing as television perfection.Perfection, though, would’ve involved Gino asking, as he did: “Who comes to houses at this time of the evening ” and McIntyre opening his bedroom cupboard door with a “TA-DA! Paul Young does, Gino.”A Dominatrix on C’s The Sex Business: Pain For Pleasure B Head of Drama at the BBC THE BBC really has created a Sports Personality Of The Year show in the image of its co-host Clare Balding and her all-consuming inferiority complex, hasn’t it A vast and murky event that clearly thinks it’s an adorable, all-inclusive, finger-on-the-pulse, rock ’n’ roll jamboree but is actually a nerdy, uptight, controlling, gender-obsessed, PC quota-thon of the most self-deceiving kind.So Tyson Fury, who has a genuine personality, was excluded from the final six, but Billie Jean King was all over proceedings and England’s Common-wealth Games netball women were apparently the “team of the year”.SPOTY was at its absolute worst, though, trying to do populist, celebrating the all-conquering England World Cup football team , with some BBC-approved patriotism.That is to say, a multi-cultural version of Three Lions, featuring Bhangra dancers, a steel band and a gospel choir, without whom, the BBC presumably imagined, England fans would be goose-stepping round the NEC burning crosses.No one can say for surethis ill-judged segment influenced the final vote, won by Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, of course, but Harry Kane started the night as favourite and ended it third, after something  happened during the song that was so horrendous and disturbing no one who heard the incident can ever mention it or the offender ever again.I hope you’re bloody proud of yourself, David Baddiel.The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote the Keats poem Ode To A Nightingale ”Joe Lycett: “Which American state is home to the Dallas Cowboys ”And  to , Sandi Toksvig: “What five-letter word for a native of one of the Scandinavian countries is also a British name for a root vegetable similar to a turnip ”GOOD Morning Britain, Tuesday Piers Morgan: “The lady who brings our food in has announced she’s quitting.

Remainer Amber Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to break ranks and say there was an argument for a new public vote. Today the Work and Pensions Secretary was slapped down by Prime Minister Theresa May. Brexiteer colleague Andrea Leadsom added a second vote was unacceptable - and opened new splits by talking up a No Deal brexit. Askedthe Prime Minister thought it was “plausible” to hold a second referendum, Theresa Mays spokesman said: “No.  “The Work and Pensions Secretary has been clear on three things: the priority is to get the vote through Parliament she doesnt want a peoples vote or a referendum and shes asked all colleagues to support the Governments deal. “The PM has been very clear on the dangers of calling a second referendum. “She is focused on winning the vote on the deal that has been agreed.” Brexiteer Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said a second referendum would be unacceptable - and went further. Ms Leadsom insisted a managed no-deal Brexit is possible as Cabinet isions were laid bare.  The Commons leader suggested she had been looking at the option as an alternative solution to the Prime Ministers deal,that cannot get through Parliament. She told BBC Radio : A managed no-deal does not necessarily mean there is no Withdrawal Agreement at all. This is all speculation, but what I am looking at is trying to find an alternative that, in the event we cannot agree to this deal, that there could be a further deal that looks at a more minimalist approach that allows us to leave with some kind of deal and some kind of implementation period that avoids a clf edge, that avoids uncertainty for businesses and travellers and so on.  Ms Rudd made the comments that sparked the row last night. She insisted she did not want another vote and urged MPs to reach a consensus as a way of preventing a no-deal BrexitTheresa Mays withdrawal agreement is thrown out in Januarys vote. Ms Rudd told ITVs Peston: I dont want a peoples vote, or a referendum in general, butParliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus I could see there would be a plausible argument for it.Labours Owen Smith, a backer of anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: Amber Rudd may be the first Tory Cabinet member to say shed rather have a peoples vote than allow a catastrophic no-deal to unfold, but she wont be the last.This is a massive moment for our campaign.

Volunteers have silenced seasonal tunes as hard-up Britons flock for vital supplies to get them through the holiday. The Mirror spoke to three foodbank managers as part of our End Hunger, Feed a Family Christmas appeal to raise cash for the Trussell Trust, Britain’s biggest foodbank network. While firm figures will be published in the coming months, all reported surges in demand for their lesaving packages. Debbie Shelley, of South Sefton foodbank on Merseyside, believed as many as three out of five hungry people walking through the foodbank’s doors are the working poor – evidence of poverty wages in Breadline Britain. Volunteers can become upset at the stories they hear as households reveal their heartbreaking reasons for seeking help.   She said: “Every so often there is one that just gets to you, especially on Christmas Eve. “People have come in and told me such sad things on Christmas Eve. “This sounds really awful but it doesn’t seem appropriate to have Christmas music on in the background. “Sometimes it does upset me, but at least I can try and do something for them.” Volunteers at South Sefton gave away , parcels from January to November this year. Over the same period in , they handed out , – meaning a .% rise over  months. And the run-up to Christmas always triggers a rise in need. “Last December we had a real spike - we gave out ,” said Debbie. “In a normal month, it’s  on average. “People often have devastating things going on in their lives, especially this time of year.  “People are finding it dficult to cope financially. “You might budget well all year but then Christmas comes andsomething  happens – your washing machine breaks or you have a bereavement – it just throws that into chaos.” Debbie, who was awarded an MBE last year, added: “It’s been a bit mental this week,” Hugh McNeill, of Coventry foodbank, agreed recent days had seen the traditional surge in need. He said: “It has been absolutely crazy. “Normally we see somewhere in the region of  to  people a month coming through. “But in December that tends to accelerate and we see more people.  “We’ve had over  people for this month so far - that’s in keeping with last year. “Butwe go back to  then it’s a % increase from then.” He blamed Universal Credit, the Government’s flagship welfare shake-up, for fuelling the surge in demand. “Universal Credit seems to be the hallmark of what we’re hearing this year,” he said. “It seems like every second person we talk to says about the issues they are facing with Universal Credit – delays.   “It is the main driving factor we are seeing now at thefoodbanksin Coventry. “Full roll-out started in July and we didn’t see a big kick-in straight away. “But since the beginning of November, more and more people are saying to us, ‘The reasons we are here are because of Universal Credit’. “It’s just overwhelmed people in its implementation and complexity, how dficult it is to navigate your way through the process.” In , , people used a foodbank in Coventry. Last December, volunteers gave away . tonnes of aid via the city’sfoodbanks– Hugh and is braced to hand out even more this month. “We are at the maximum we can work at,” he admitted. “It puts enormous pressure on us.   “Christmas is always an incredibly busy time for us.” At Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd’s local foodbank in Hastings, East Sussex, coordinator Natalie Williams warned: “It has been really busy - we are always busy at this time of year.” She is ready for a fresh spike in January when Christmas bills start arriving and temperatures plunge. “It’s become a bit of a clicheacute but we genuinely see people having to make those decisions between heating and eating,” she said. “That tends to kick in more in January. “Boilers tend to break in the cold weather or pipes burst, and so suddenly there’s nothing left to deal with the kind of crisis. “We also have people who have struggled to make everything come together for their kids at Christmas, and then in January the reality hits that they have run out of their resources.”  Like Hugh, she believed UC was fuelling demand, identying a % rise since the benefit overhaul arrived in Hastings. Some desperate people have even credited the foodbank with helping them back from the brink of taking their lives. “It’s heartbreaking. You see people who are suicidal and some people have said to us, ‘You’re the only thing that’s stood between me and suicide’,” she said. “That’s a horrible thing to hear. Obviously it makes us glad that we are here and doing what we are doing, but it’s upsetting.” A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: “No one should have to face hardship with Universal Credit as we’ve made up to % advances available from day one and we know the vast majority of Universal Credit recipients are happy managing their money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn lashes out media","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn lashes out at media for being obsessed over stupid woman rowThe Labour leader says what he \"muttered\" to himself in Parliament is not worthy of media obsessionShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editorMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video corbyn-says-media-utterly-obsessed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Corbyn has lashed out at the media for being utterly obsessed with whether he called Theresa May a stupid woman.

The fact that a homeless man died outside Parliament has got no coverage whatsoever, and it should.  Mr Corbyn added: The respectful nature of Parliament is important and a whole load of Tory MPs turning the issue of a no-deal Brexit into a pantomime, that is serious. Meanwhile, Theresa May has backed Andrea Leadsoms decision to confront Commons Speaker John Bercow over alleged sexism. Leader of the House Mrs Leadsom leapt on the row engulfing Jeremy Corbyn to fire her own barb at Mr Bercow following Wednesdays stormy Prime Ministers Questions.  Mr Corbyn was accused of muttering “stupid woman” about the PM, a charge he denied. Mrs Leadsom claims the Speaker used the same term to her previously. And the PM supported the Commons Leaders decision to challenge the Speaker.

Research by the Young Women’s Trust suggested young parents with kids at high school are most likely to receive vital supplies from the leline centres. A survey of , people aged  to  indicated one in four was always in debt, while barriers faced by mothers in finding work piled extra pressure on stretched family budgets. The Trust’s Joe Levenson said: “Parents want to give their children the best but are facing huge financial challenges, especially over this Christmas period.  “A shocking number are having to skip meals or turn to foodbanks in order to feed their children, and many are getting into debt. “They are telling us they want to be financially independent but a combination of low pay and high childcare costs prevents that. “It doesn’t help that young people are entitled to less financial support and lower wages for no other reason than their age.” The study was published as the Mirror’s End Hunger, Feed a Family Christmas appeal continues to raise funds for the Trussell Trust, Britain’s biggest foodbank network. A Populus Data Solutions survey found two in five young women said it is a “real struggle” to make their cash last to the end of the month.  One in four admitted they are in debt “all of the time”. Mums who are in work often struggle too as they are more likely to be on low pay, with the Government’s national living wage only applying to workers aged  and over. Young women are also more likely to be in low-paid sectors, such as hospitality, care work and catering. Mr Levenson added: “This Christmas, the Government needs to step up to stop people going hungry.  “This means ensuring everyone who wants to work gets the right skills and support to find jobs, encouraging flexible working for parents and carers and paying a proper Living Wage that doesn’t discriminate against age. “This would benefit businesses and the economy too.” A Government spokesman said: “We’re committed to ensuring families get the support they need, and there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with . “Both the employment rate and household incomes have never been higher and there are fewer children living in workless households than ever before. “For those families that need extra support, we are spending pound billion a year on working-age benefits and with Universal Credit, working parents can claim back up to % of eligible childcare costs compared to % on the legacy benefit system.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gorgeous babies who spent first","story":"NewsGorgeous babies who spent first Christmas fighting for le are celebrating miracle survivalBorn just before Christmas  with devastating heart defects they all underwent gruelling surgery when they were just days old but look at them now.ShareCommentsByRuth Huntman:,  DEC News \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLooking at them now, it’s hard to believe that these adorable babies spent their first Christmas fighting for their lives. Born just before Christmas  with devastating heart defects they all underwent gruelling surgery when they were just days old. It should be a time when new mums are excitedly shopping for cute baby reindeer and Santa outfits and capturing their little angels’ excited faces on camera by the tree. But cruelly, the festive season was cancelled for the families of BeauEdward and Leoas they spent most of it at their babies’ hospital bedsides praying for a true Christmas miracle.Their prayers were answered and this Christmas, to mark their milestone, The British Heart Foundation got all three precious puddings together for a special festive shoot and film as part of the charity’s Christmas appeal,During pregnancy, Edward, Leo and Beau’s mothers got the bombshell that their children would be born with heart defects.  Leo’s mum Aimee Roberts, , from Bristol explains: “At my  week scan we were told baby had a hole in the heart but that it wasn’t serious and the hole would probably close by itself after he was born. But when he was born he was rushed off to Intensive Care for tests and that’s when we got the shattering news he actually had four major heart defects and would need immediate open heart surgery to stand any chance of survival. “At a week old Leo had a seven hour operation – he only weighed five pounds. Against the odds Leo came home for the first time on December rd but Christmas was cancelled as far as we were concerned. We just had pie and chips- what we’d found in the freezer - for Christmas dinner and we didn’t do presents, we just tried to get through it. “He came home with a personal nurse who looked after him on Christmas and Boxing Day but then we had to rush him back into AE the day after Boxing Day as his vocal cords was paralysed from all the bruising he’d got from tubes down his throat. We finally got him back home on New Year’s Eve. This year we are so grateful that we’ll have the traditional family Christmas we missed out on last year.”  Baby Beau was born in August last year with half a heartand had her first open heart surgery at just two days old and weighing just six pounds. She was on le support for a week but then began to recover well enough tohome after spending the first five weeks of her le in hospital. But just before her first Christmas she went into heart failure and was rushed back into hospital. Mum Demi feared the worst as Beau faced another open heart surgery at  months old. Demi and Beau managed tohome for Christmas last year, but Demi admits that the family struggled to celebrate because her daughter was still so poorly. “I am actually looking forward to Christmas this time, says Demi, , from Birmingham. “I cant wait to show her the trees, the baubles and the lights - I just want to spoil her. Its just so emotional, because we didnt think she would make it to one.”  Baby Edward’s mum Stephanie Lewis,  from Wales also had the worst Christmas of her le, Her son was born with Pulmonary Atresiaand had two keyhole heart surgery at just two days old to open up a valve in his heart. “But at six weeks old Edward deteriorated as he wasn’t getting enough blood supply to his lungs and he had to have open heart surgery. We also discovered also he had kidney problems. “Last Christmas was horrendous as Edward was not in one hospital but four being treated for ious complications. This will be his first Christmas at home and we are planning to go to town and make it one to remember.

Ewan Parry was diagnosed with medulloblastoma in  and despite two years of gruelling treatment he died in  when he was just seven years old. Speaking ahead of her third Christmas without her little boy, mum Katy has praised the staff at Claire House Hospice in The Wirral for helping to make his last two extra special. Even though the family opted to take him home for Christmas in  and , they visited the hospice for lots of fun festive parties. Katy told : Its a magical place at Christmas time, we went to events and parties - it doesnt matter what ability or disability the child has, theyre all treated equally.  We met Santa, they did all sorts of things like prepared tea, it was just magical. After his diagnoses in , the family stayed at the hospice while Ewan had radiotherapy at Clatterbridge hospital, and they opted to spend Christmas Day at home. We thought he was on the mend, and as hes a Christmas Eve baby they offered for us to come and stay but we made plans and wanted to have Christmas at home to try grasp a bit of normality, Katy explains. Following the first Christmas after Ewans diagnosis, Katy says his treatment damaged his brain which meant he then had to be fed through his stomach - which added to the traumatic ordeal for the family. He was such a bright lad and it was absolutely devastating. In the run up to Christmas , the family went to Claire House for lots of festive events. The family celebrated Ewans birthday, which is on Christmas Eve, and went to parties as well as making memories together, including a trip to London. We were inundated with Lego, because [the hospice] knew how much Ewan loved Lego, Katy said. They made a memory box for me of moments with Ewan, which we didnt know about until after he died.  The family were at Claire House on a planned stay on th December, when Ewan fell ill and didnt regain consciousness. He passed away in January . We believe he wanted to be there, Katy says. Although Christmas is a very tough time, Katy, her partner and daughter Niamh do still enjoy the festive period together. We wouldnt be here without the support of that place, they take on the burden during the worst thing you can ever go through in your le. We still do enjoy Christmas even though its a very hard time for us. Its special because of how much he touched everyone there. Its a place of hope. People think a hospice is where people go to die, but its really where you go to live and make memories. The effort they go to is above and beyond and were endlessly grateful.  Festive events at Claire House begin at the end of November when they hold the Light for Love event and light the Christmas tree in memory of all the children who have come to the hospice over the past  years. This year there has been four weeks of festivities, including Pantomime visits, visits from Santa and his reindeers, local choirs, and visits from Everton football club players. Jenner Bell, hospice manager at Claire House, said: Christmas is an amazing time at Claire House. But for some families this Christmas might be their last together, so we want to make it as special as we can.  There is always the sound of Christmas music and laughter. The play room is a hub of arts and crafts, and there is always a mince pie or two available for staff and visitors. On Christmas Day most families want to be at home. We do what we can to make this possible – including doing home visits and being on call in emergencies. The Hospice remains openwe have a child who is coming to the end of their le, or has sadly passed away. Staff then work over the Christmas period, and although this is a sad time, the staff know they are able to help a family when they need us most.

Thousands of passengers are currently stranded after two drones were spotted near the runway at Gatwick Airport in West Sussex. Authorities took the decision to close the airport, erting planes already in the air and cancelling many others yet to take off. This remarkable footage, from the University of Dayton Research Institute’s Impact Physics Lab in Ohio, US, shows how even small drones can pose a risk to manned aircraft. It may explain why bosses at Gatwick chose to close the runways and not risk the lives of pilots, crews, passengers or those on the ground.  The research was a comparative study between a bird strike and a drone strike on an aircraft wing, using a drone similar in weight to many hobby drones. A wing was selected to represent a leading edge structure of a commercial transport aircraft. The drone and gel bird were the same weight and were launched at rates designed to reflect the relative combined speed of a fully intact drone traveling toward a commercial transport aircraft moving at a high approach speed.  Kevin Poormon, group leader for impact physics at UDRI, said: “We’ve performed bird-strike testing for  years, and we’ve seen the kind of damage birds can do. Drones are similar in weight to some birds, and so we’ve watched with growing concern as reports of near collisions have increased. And, as the footage shows, the impact was signicant. The drone is almost swallowed by the wing, leaving a huge gaping hole in the structure.Experts say drones could have catastrophic consequencesthey hit aircraft.  Dr Rob Hunter, head of flight safety at the British Airline Pilots Association , said: The public needs to understand that drones are not just toys and could have catastrophic consequencesthey collide with an aircraft. We know a lot of drones will be under peoples Christmas trees and we implore them to ensure theyre aware of the rules and fly their drones in a safe and sensible manner. These drone sightings at Gatwick are further evidence that tougher laws and enforcement are required to keep drones clear of manned flights. BALPA is also calling for the Government to consider toughening the law to create a larger no-fly zone around airports.  We need to ensure people flying drones take responsibility for their actions and do so responsibly with the knowledge thatthey endanger an aircraft they could face jail. Dr Hunter added: Even two kilograms of metal and plastic, including the battery, hitting an aircraft windscreen or engine or a helicopter tail rotor, could be catastrophic. People who buy these devices need to make sure that they know the rules and stick to them, so they dont put anyones le in danger.  Pilots dont want to ruin anyones fun butyou are going to use drones the message is clear: Know the laws or expect serious consequences. Before taking to the air have a really good think about where you are, keep your drone in sight, consider what aircraft might be flying about and keep clear - it is your responsibility. According to the British Airline Pilots Association , there were already  near misses between manned aircraft and drones up until November this year, compared to  for the whole of . This is not the first time an incident involving drones has been reported at London Gatwick. In October, it was reported that a drone put  lives at risk after nearly hitting an aircraft approaching the airport over the summer.

An image of a sign from the Tesco Extra store, in St Leonards on Sea, was shared on social media by a customer named Rob Lowe last week. Mr Lowe argued that the sign wasnt really acceptable anymore and he felt it set a poor example for his young daughter, who loves unicorns and dolls but also enjoys playing with dinosaurs. He wrote: Come on Tesco. This isnt really acceptable anymore. My daughter loves unicorns and dolls. She ALSO loves robots, dinosaurs, rockets, monsters and Lego. Dont make me have to reassure her that this is ok.  His post has since gone viral, with almost , likes and hundreds of shares. Many people praised Rob for his post and agreed that the supermarket chain should remove the sign from their stores to allow children to pick whatever toy they want to play with, regardless of their gender. A fellow parent branded the sign ridiculous. She said: Ridiculous! Mum of  girls that also like cars, dinosaurs and superheroes. Yes it does matter - its the inherent sexism that girls and women face through their le. This is just for boys.  Another person added: Please Tesco, please remove signs identying toys for girlsor boys . This is , boys and girls must both have the opportunity of a wider choice of toys . You have a responsibility to your customers, me and my extended family included. A third simply wrote: Gender marketing is lazy and sexist. TV writer Donna Fanceschild also couldnt help but notice the grammar mistake in the sign - and claimed Tescos lack of an apostrophe was just more evidence of sexism. She commented: Plus, how is she supposed to get to grips with English grammarTesco omits the crucial apostrophe indicating the possessive   Perhaps they dont think girls should be worrying their pretty little heads about that. However there were many people who thought Rob was overreacting. One Twitter user posted: If I was shopping for my daughter Id find this very helpful. Another slammed people who were offended by the sign.  They said: Has anyone actually met a person thats offended by the absolute nonsense gender fluid bulls*** going on at the moment  Apparently Tesco has a girls toys aisle and people are unhappy  Who are these freaks  Someone  tweeted: Tesco are purely labelling an aisle for stock purposes and the name is irrelevant. Hence the meat aisle has meat and the veg aisle has veg. Who said robots arent girls toys  Or are you assuming that every girls toy must be pink and fluffy  Putting an end to the heated debate, Tesco have admitted that the signs are no longer appropriate. A spokesperson for the company said, “We agree toys are for everyone and removed the ‘Girls’ Toys’ and ‘Boys’ Toys’ signage from our stores several years ago, but it appears that this one was missed. We will have it changed to the new signage as soon as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccann search not stop","story":"NewsMadeleine McCann search will not stop until it reaches conclusionMadeleine McCann vanished during a  family holiday in Portugal and politan Police commissioner Cressida Dick says they will continue the hunt until they find out what happened to herShareByJerry Lawton:,  DEC NewsMadeleine was three when she was last seen on holiday with her parents in Portugal in May  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe search for missing Madeleine McCann will not stop until it has reached its conclusion, Britains top police chief has vowed. politan Police commissioner Cressida Dick has revealed they will continue to exhaust all possible lines of inquiry despite cash being tight in the force. She told the Daily Star: “I am quite happy it should continue until we find out what happened or we have exhausted all possible lines of inquiry. Ms Dick has also spoken of how she was part of the team that set up the Operation Grange inquiry into the youngster’s  disappearance in Portugal. It came after a personal plea by Madeleine’s doctor parents Kate and Gerry to then Prime Minister David Cameron.   Ms Dick, who was an assistant commissioner in the Met at the time, said she had supported the move by the force to launch a probe into the mystery even though it appeared to have no jurisdiction. Madeleine vanished abroad and her family’s home force in the UK was Leicestershire. Since then Scotland Yard has spent nearly poundmillion of taxpayers’ cash on the inquiry but no-one has been charged. Last month, the Home Office granted the force an extra pound, to continue the probe until at least April next year.   The move sparked criticism from the Police Federation and some former Met officers who argued the money would be better spent tackling London’s record number of homicides, kne crime and terrorism. Britain’s top police officer said she understood their concerns but felt the Madeleine investigation was too important to shelve and she had set no time limit on it. Ms Dick said: “I was there when it was set up originally. “I remember when this piece of work was started and why. “I can understand why some people may feel dferently but I think it is quite right that we should continue until it has reached its conclusion.’’   Ms Dick admitted the Met was still short of cash despite Home Secretary Sajid Javid last week pledging an extra poundbn to forces nationwide. The commissioner said the Force could benefit from an extra poundmLondon mayor Sadiq Khan chose to generate the maximum amount possible via council tax rises. But she admitted that may not be enough to save officers’ jobs following years of cutbacks. However she said that would not impact on Operation Grange. She said: “It’s not a huge amount of money and it’s not large number of officers.” Referring to the force’s determination to trace and bring to justice the poisoners of Salisbury spy Sergei Skripal she added: “We never give up in the Met. “We never have. “We never forget.” The news will come as a massive boost to Madeleine’s parents who earlier this year had feared it could be shelved and they would have to fund expensive private detectives to continue the search.   Then-three-year-old Madeleine vanished from the family’s holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz  years ago while her parents dined with pals in a nearby tapas bar. Portuguese police archived the case as ‘unsolved’ in . They are now working alongside Met detectives in a bid to determine what happened. Last month it was revealed both forces were probingMadeleine had come to harm after walking out of the apartment in a bid to find her parents. Until then the Met thought she either disturbed burglars or was abducted. The McCanns continue to believe she was snatched from her bed by an intruder and may still be alive. Ms Dick declined to discuss ‘operational details’.

Janusz Jelen would watch Agnieszka Mogilska while he was at work by logging onto a device on his iPhone. Through a speaker he would ask the mother-of-two to raise her arm to seeshe had any fat and to suggest she wear trousers as he claimed her thighs were shaking. He would also eavesdrop on conversations the -year-old was having with her friends. Machine operator Jelen, , has been banned from contacting Ms Mogilska over his oppressive and degrading behaviour.   Police were called in after Ms Mogilska, a production worker at a lighting company said the she felt like she in a mental hospital with  hours a day surveillance. In a statement she said: As a result of this relationship I do not like my body. Im always covering my roll of fat on my stomach by crossing my arms and do not like the fat on my thighs, despite wearing a size . I sleep less and I am exhausted all the time and have been terried since it ended. I was in a domestic violence relationship before with my ex husband and I cant believe this is happening again. I have been struggling since. At Tameside magistrates court, Jelen was convicted at an earlier hearing of an offence of engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour between November  and October this year.   He was given a  week jail term suspended for a year and issued with a  month restraining order. He was also ordered to complete a  month community order plus  hours of unpaid work. He will pay court charges of pound. The couple, who moved to the UK from their native Poland had been dating for two years but arguments began when Jelen laughed at her about her English pronunciation. Miss Mogilska said: At first I felt very happy and loved but then there were allegations made every day that I am fat and stupid and that I didnt know English. He said my children are stupid and that they will be deported back to Poland because they dont know English. He said I would not get help here, the only help I would get isI got with a man who was English. He gave me psychological abuse. I told him I would rather he had hit me in the face because that would stop hurting - but the words dont.   He observed me through cameras, and he told me to lt my arm to see my fat. I put on shorts when it was hot and he followed me, and told me to put on long trousers because my thighs were shaking. I spoke English but he would laugh at my pronunciation. Several times a day he would say things about me or my children. The camera was installed in July . He had an application on his phone which enabled him to watch the camera from work. When I tried to turn it off he would text me to say to put it back on and would watch all the time. I told him I didnt like the cameras and he said that it was there for my safety because he loves me. I felt like I was in a mental hospital with  hours a day surveillance. When my friends came over he was listening to our conversations.   He didnt like some of my friends and tried to cause conflict between me and them which caused one of them to stop seeing me. He tried to say I had other lovers virtually all the time andI went somewhere, he would say I was seeing other people. I did not pick his friends for him so he cannot pick mine. Everyone has rights to have their freedom. I would go out in the day as I didnt want to see him and he works at night. I would go out and it would cause arguments. He said he would kill my other lover and he followed me when I went to the shop. I asked him to take down the camera and do this so we could split up peacefully like human beings but things got worse. We were arguing non-stop and he would then apologise and give me flowers. I was fed up and went to the police.   I did warn him beforehand that I would and he was laughing at me saying no one would help me. I went to the shop which caused an argument and he said you dont go to the shop at this hour. When I went through the door he said I am going to kill you b*tch and him too. I was walking towards the shop and I was on the phone. On the way back my daughter rang me and said he had left home. I felt like someone was following me or watching me. At first I felt very happy and loved. There was a situation when he came in from work before I went to the police. He came in the bedroom as he thought I was sleeping with someone. He took my arm and pushed me and said who the f*** did you sleep with. He wouldnt let me sleep in his bed or the sofa as he said they belong to him.   Jelen, who is currently single, denied wrongdoing. His lawyer Saul Comish said: The cameras had been installed for over a year and there was no complaint for a while. The comments he made were hurtful and the camera was there recording her in the house. But he never controlled her movements or who she could associate with. There are some cultural elements to this as this type of offence is not common in Poland with this type of behaviour. He accepts what he did, he recognises that the relationship is over and has not made contact with her.   But a probation report read to the court said: I believe there are elements of sexual jealousy as motivation for this offence as he thought she was in another relationship and made threats to the other potential male. There is no insight into his abusive behaviour and to some extent there is some sense of entitlement. There is no previous record of abusive behaviour but the offences were over a prolonged period of time. This was his first long-term relationship so he may do this again unless his thinking is changed. Chairman of the bench Jill Simpson told Jelen: We believe you displayed oppressive treatment intended to degrade her. You will need to mody your behaviour.

The in-depth breakdown picked out dozens of spots due to suffer serious congestion in London, Manchester, Newcastle and Edinburgh as Christmas shoppers rush to make their final purchases. Experts predict between - pm and - pm will be the worst times to be on the UK’s roads, caused by the perfect storm of last-minute shoppers, peak times at train stations, travelling to sporting fixtures and those heading home for Christmas. In the capital, jams are expected to start as early as : in the morning, as traffic snarls along the A near Wembley and the A by the O Arena.  Millions of shoppers will be flooding onto the roads, making supermarkets and shopping centres busier than usual. As the morning progresses, roads in major cities will see congestion pile up as people head to catch trains before the weekend countrywide rail maintenance begins. It will also see any minor accidents lead to bigger issues, based on data from ’s festive period. The visualisation was created by real-time traffic app Waze, whose UK country manager Finlay Clark said: “We used analysis from the equivalent Saturday in , with insight about the events due to take place in  and Waze’s travel planned drive data, to make our predictions for Saturday’s troublesome traffic. “We’ll see widespread disruption in many of the UK’s major cities and on the roads in general, ahead of the maintenance works taking place on the rail network that begin on Sunday. “This will be further exacerbated in places like Manchester, where major roadworks have been causing chaos on the roads.  “The roads will be even worse this year than they were at the same point  months ago, as people choose the weekend to travel, seeking to avoid late night travel on Friday to get around the country for Christmas. “And there are likely to be lots more disruptions in London as well – from roadworks and closures to sporting events, which will cause huge tailbacks.” According to the data, drivers doing last-minute shopping can expect to find increased traffic around toy stores, which saw a  per cent increase in navigation to these locations, as well as flower shops, bookstores, and jewellery sellers. Both supermarkets and department stores will see a  per cent increase in people navigating to them on ‘Super Saturday’. In London, however, Waze predicts that by mid-morning London traffic will be in a frenzy, with six areas featuring traffic at a ‘standstill’, as well as high police visibility. In , over  accidents were reported on London roads on the Saturday before Christmas, according to Waze.  With the expected Central Line strike, Westfield shopping centres will see more drivers than normal causing traffic to bloom out of control as nearby Cha and West Ham football matches kick off at pm. The traffic jams, disruptions and accidents - both major and minor - will continue to escalate until at least pm, when the numbers of road users finally begin to dwindle. The hypnotic video shows the traffic hotspots blooming and then receding as huge volumes of vehicles move around the city. Elsewhere in the country, peak shopping hours between -pm in Manchester will see heavy jams around Salford Shopping City, as well as several sections of standstill vehicles outside Manchester Piccadilly station. Roads will also be gridlocked around Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium, which will also have a heavy police presence, when their home game kicks off at pm. “The Regent Road and Mancunian Way roadworks in Manchester have caused major disruption to the city since September, there has been a  per cent increase in traffic reports, on average. Edinburgh has also seen a vast increase in traffic issues over the past year, which will come to a head between -pm with a big rugby game at Murrayfield and people heading away from the shops. Adverse weather conditions are also expected to impact traffic in Edinburgh and other parts of Scotland. Finlay Clark added: “While we typically see increases in traffic over the Christmas period, the sheer number of engineering works, coinciding with when Christmas falls this year will make the roads busier than normal. “We’re also expecting to see more people who don’t drive regularly to be hitting the roads due to trains being unavailable, so it’s important that drivers are more mindful and aware of others on the roads. “The expected cold snap and threat of snow over the Christmas period may also see more pressure on the roads. Drivers should always check their journeys before setting off. “The Waze community works to ensure our maps are updated in real-time to help others on the road be aware of what is coming up ahead. “If jams happen, Waze is able to ert other drivers to alternative routes to help ease congestion.”For live traffic updates in your area, or to plan your journey visit https:www.waze en-GB livemap "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast christmas getaway","story":"NewsUK weather forecast:  flood alerts in place with Christmas getaway under threatThe Met Office is predicting days of wet and windy weather for much of the UK - but will it be a white Christmas ShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video white-christmas-year-watch-forecast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThunderstorms and gales are set to hammer parts of Britain, threatening to disrupt Christmas getaways for millions and putting homes and roads at risk of flooding. Violent weather systems are bringing days of heavy rain in the lead-up to the big day next week. There are already  flood alerts in place following weeks of soggy weather that has left some streams swollen and the ground saturated. Wet and windy weather will persist into the weekend, the Met Office says, as millions travel by car, rail or air to visit family over the holiday, or finish their Christmas shopping.  The conditions threaten to disrupt travel and forecasters have warned that some streams could breach their banks and flood homes, businesses or roads. The government has warned Britons to be prepared as flooding is possible. Meteorologist Alex Deakin said people in some places will wake up to a “rumble of thunder” on Thursday morning. Drivers should take care during the commute on rain-slicked roads. The Met Office forecaster told the Express: “All the heavy showers are mulling around an area of low pressure, and there is more where that came from. There will be more low-pressure systems and more weather fronts, which will bring heavy rain.”  The worst conditions are expected in the south-west of England, although heavy rain will move northwards through the day. Heavy showers are likely during the evening commute. The Met Office said Friday will be grey and wet for most of the UK, with gales around coasts. Its been dubbed Frantic Friday because schools break up that day and millions of Britons will begin their Christmas getaways. The AA is expecting  million vehicles on the roads, and the RAC is predicting the most congested getaway rush for years. Those trying to fly into or out of Gatwick Airport on Thursday faced major disruption, with its lone runway closed due to drones buzzing over the airfield.  Saturday will see bright spells and scattered showers as many people make their last-minute shopping trips. There will be further outbreaks of rain from Sunday through the start of next week, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Christmas Day will be mild in most places, with increasing amounts of dry weather, the Met Office said.

Meanwhile, many will most likely see a mild day on Christmas Day itself, with increasing amounts of dry weather.

Suzanne Coates said she had no choice and wanted to save their disappointment on Christmas Day after a move to Universal Credit left her unable to afford to buy them any presents. The -year-old is now postponing the festive day until February when her benefit claim will have been processed, reports Hull Live. But she has been left in tears with stress at the thought of breaking the magic around Santa to daughters, Bethany,  and Gracie Mae, .  I feel really bad because Ive said to the kids Santa isnt real, I do it, I go shopping, I put your presents out. I told them everything, she said. Ive been crying so much recently, Ive been an emotional wreck, I feel poorly constantly, stressing about it. I didnt want to tell them but I had no choice. Ms Coates switched to the new controversial benefit after getting a job as a cleaner, which meant she had to come off Job Seekers Allowance - which she had claimed for ten years - and claim for Universal Credit instead. Universal Credit is paid monthly in arrears, so applicants have to wait one calendar month before they receive their first payment and then have to wait up to seven days for the payment to reach their accounts, which can leave them short for five weeks. But the mum was determined to get a job to make a better le for her and her daughters. She said she hated the job centre where she claims she was treated like dirt. However, she now wishes she had stayed on Job Seekers Allowance.   She said: I wish Id stayed on JSA because at least I had stability in the old system. You knew where you were with money and when you would get paid, it goes into bank every four weeks, but now Im going from one month the other not knowing what money Ive got. I know youre meant to feel great when you get a job but I dont feel great, I just want to pack it in. Universal Credit is just rubbish, theres no stability in your le. I dont know how Ill manage, but we do, we buy from charity shops, I budget, I always make sure Ive got a full freezer. Ms Coates said she will postpone Christmas until February, when she will have received her first months wages. She said her children seem to understand, and has promised them she will still make sure they have a happy Christmas.   She said: They know they have to wait for their main gts, they are still getting a little something but not what they have asked for all year round. But were still going to have a good Christmas, but more of happier one. Because of me telling them about Santa I feel a bit more happier knowing that they understand and know they know why Ive been so upset, which I have. I said they will get stuff but they wont have surprises because I aint got help from anyone . They know not to be spoilt, theyve had the odd few gts that they didnt know about in the past but Ill add them when I do a second Christmas in February. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition.  Usually Im an organised mum but this year I changed and got a job to make something better for me and the kids and its ended up worse. Previously, on the issue of Universal Credit a Department of Work and Pensionsspokesman has said: “Universal Credit simplies an out-of-date, complex system with evidence showing that under UC claimants are getting into work faster and staying in work longer. “Our research shows that many people join Universal Credit with pre-existing arrears, but the proportion of people with arrears falls by a third after four months in UC.

In , the -year-old, from Guadalajara, Mexico, underwent le-changing surgery to remove  percent of his stomach. Since then, he has been living on a strict diet and has lost an impressive lbs - but his weight is still putting him at extreme risk of cardiac arrest. This means he needed further surgery. Juan said: The most important thing for me is to walk again. I haven’t left the house for six years or even walked anywhere.”  Growing up, Juan was always overweight but a bus accident in his late teens left him in a coma and bed bound. He said: I broke half my body. I broke all of my right side ribs, leg, everything.” Over the last couple of years, Juan’s weight-loss progress has been monitored by bariatric surgeon, Dr Jose Castaneda Cruz.He also carried out both surgeries. Juan’s second operation reduced his stomach even further, to create a pouch smaller than an egg. The pouch will bypass his lower stomach and connect to his small intestines. The surgery was le-threatening, but the former worlds heaviest man had no choice. Dr Castaneda said: Death in these patients is likelythey dont get treated we have to risk it because its a le opportunity for the patient. The journey to the hospital was the first time the keen baker had left the house in six months. Juan’s specially strengthened bed had to be dismantled and set up again for him in hospital, as he was too heavy for a normal bed.  The invasive surgery only took an hour and Juan recovered well. He is now on a strict diet and exercise regime to lose a further  lbs in  months. In six months, Juan lost  lbs and now weights under  lbs or  stone - almost half his original weight.His dream of being able to walk again has also come true. He said: Its a really big achievement for me to get up take two, three steps. But I’m very happy you can see Im already starting to move. Juan still needs to lose weight over the next year. But he looks forward to the day when hell be recognised for achieving another world record. He said: If one day I gain the title ‘the man who lost the most weight’ then I will celebrate.”*Body Bizarre is on Saturdays at pm on TLC UK "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c1a342db6782.jpg ","title":"aberdeen thumping proves we need new signings says dundee boss jim mcintyre","story":"Dundee’s thumping at the hands of Aberdeen has strengthened boss Jim McIntyre’s desire to bring in reinforcements during the winter transfer window.The Dens gaffer branded his side “meek” as they were “bullied” by the Dons in a - hammering.Two goals in the first half for striker Sam Cosgrove, two for defender Andy Considine and one for youngster Connor McLennan had the dominant Dons cruising to victory.And that display has only reinforced the manager’s view that new faces are needed to get Dundee out of relegation trouble.He said: “We know work is needed to be done. That was always going to be the case no matter the result.“We’ve got some good players but we need some help.“We’re bottom for a reason so we’ve got to try to strengthen otherwise it’ll be a long season.“I don’t look at where we are just now.“I look at performances, responsibility taken by players in games and the consistency of what we’ve been getting, the decisions being made when a couple of things go against us and how we react.“That’s what I look at and will determine what I need.”Right from kick-off the Dark Blues were second best as Aberdeen moved to within a point of leaders Rangers.Cosgrove’s strikes in  and  minutes sealed the points before calamity at a corner where Andy Boyle and Nathan Ralph bundled each other over to allow Andy Considine a free header just after the break signalled a long second half ahead for the Dark Blues.The manager said: “It wasn’t good enough. Simple. No excuses. We were miles off it. Aberdeen were stronger and quicker and bullied us.“We were too meek. We need to show far far more.“When you look at the corners and losing at set-plays – you’re assigned a man and it’s not the first time I’ve seen it.“It was frustrating and disappointing.

Star striker Pavol Safranko had three decent chances and one of the gilt-edged iety.All were with his head and, given the Slovakian’s obvious quality, it’s a fair betthe same happens on any other day he’ll get on the scoresheet.On top of that, young Matty Smith also saw an excellent effort miraculously saved by keeper Mark Ridgers, meaning on most occasions this was a game that would have been won.Given their dominance of the ball, however, it’s fair to say United should have created more. That they didn’t might be a hangover from previous boss Csaba Laszlo’s year in charge.Like every manager, Laszlo had his own football philosophy and a big part of it was keeping the ball at all costs.Shortly after taking over, he told his players he’d rather they played the ball all the way back to the halfway line than take a gamble and just send it into the opposition penalty box.While the theory behind that is understandable, it led to his team often passing the opposition to death but too often without creating chances, never mind scoring goals.Particularly in the first half up at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium on Saturday, that problem reared its head again. As the manager touched on in his post-match interview, on a string of occasions when they got the ball into the final third, the chance to get it into the penalty box was passed up in favour of a pass back to a deeper lying team-mate.It might just be that, when in advanced areas, taking a gamble and putting in crosses that give the opposition something to defend would be a more fruitful option."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

And she urged people to talk to the councilthey felt they should be getting more.Councillor Andrew Baxter, instead of criticising the current deal, said the council should be looking ahead to apply for the next deal to deepen the level of spending in the region.Thursday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118811.jpg","title":"Plug pulled on vital community lifeline","story":"A LIFELINE cafeacute is to close before Christmas, much to the dismay of the local community.The pioneering Archie Cafeacute, with its soft play area and hub for healthcare and local information, was hailed as ldquobrilliant when it opened in Hilton Community Centre in Inverness five years ago.It also raised money for the Highland Childrenrsquos Unit at Raigmore Hospital, opened in  after a pound million appeal by the Archie Foundation in conjunction with the Inverness Courier.The foundation has now announced the cafeacute will close on December  after running at a loss.Disappointed customers include mums who say the decision has come as a bolt out of the blue.Kirsty Rose meets other mums there when she attends the centre with son Brodiefor a pre-school gym class.ldquoWe have a blether in a nice environment and the kids are just a few feet away from us, she said. ldquoIt is reasonably priced, the staff are fabulous and it is totally geared up for kids.Mother-of-two Shaunna Leitch said it was vital to the community.ldquoIt was a leline to me when I had my second little girl as it meant we could get out of the house, she said. ldquoOften the old folk would speak to my girls and Irsquom sure it brightened their day.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens back in control and give everyone the chance to decide whether the Prime Minister’s deal is good for the country andthe UK should leave the EU on those terms.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home dec15","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  Lovely laidback ladies Ruby and Sophie are looking for a forever home together.The pair, who are  years old, still enjoy their walks but also like a sofa day too.Someone who is at home most of the time would be ideal for these girls, who are likely to follow their new owner around the home.The pooches, who are not suited to a household with children, will need to be kept on a hypoallergenic diet. vw, px\"  Gorgeous girl Freya is looking for a new owner who can take her on lots of country walks.The six-year-old, who has been neutered, has previously beem around children and will need an owner with experience of the breed.Freya is also used to other dogs but can can be quite vocal with them until she gets to know them.Can you give her a home  vw, px\"  Handsome lad Louie is on the prowl for a new home where he can get outdoors to explore.Although six-month-old Louie can be quite a feisty boy, he also adores receiving cuddles.And when it comes to playtime, this cute cat has lightning reflexes.It is not knownLouie has previously been around other animals or children.Can you give him a home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"almost 1000 north east properties left without power","story":"Power cuts left almost , properties in the north-east without power today.Just over  customers were left in the dark in the Aboyne area.The power went out at around .am this morning, and energy giant SSE managed to restore the power at .pm.The firm said that the outage was caused by faulty equipment, which caused the power to be isolated.A further  properties are also disconnected from the grid due to a low hanging wire.The properties, in the Meikle Wartle area of Aberdeenshire, just outside Insch lost power just after noon today, and SSE hopes the supply can be restored by pm.A spokeswoman for SSE said: #We’d like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused by today’s faults and thank them for their patience as our engineers work to safely carry out repairs as quickly as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/5c0e0f1918c7d-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"inspectors praise for north east nursery","story":"A north-east nursery has been praised by inspectors.The Care Inspectorate visited Fyvie Primary School on November  and said in a report: “Staff were respectful and nurturing in their interaction with the children.”They rated the care, support and environment of the nursery as “very good” – the second best of six possible ratings.A parent told inspectors: “Staff are amazing.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

Ferguslie were much more clinical and added a further two goals to give themselves a comfortable - lead at the break.Into the second half and despite some better passages of play the match was killed as a contest when Luke Kalache was ordered off for handling the ball outside the area. Young Jake Weir took his spot in goal with young McGeachy making way as the visitors were reduced to ten men. From the resulting free kick, Fergulie’s Andy Turner found the bottom corner to make it -.The home side added a fth before the ten men responded with Ryan Caskie converting a Colin Weir corner to make it -.Star were caught out again late on as Ferguslie added another two goals to make the scoreline a harsh looking - at full time.This was a stern lesson for Star, although the performance of young Neily Russell, who came on late on and looked composed up front, will give Naisby optimism.On Saturday December , Red Star are at home where another tough test against Hillington awaits.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million. This would be a considerable amount at any time, but coming after years of funding cuts already, it will demand particularly dficult decisions to be made.Councillor Aileen Morton, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, added: #This local government budget is extremely disappointing for the council, our residents and communities. The Scottish Government provides around  per cent of councils’ funding so another . per cent reduction will have signicant impact. It means we must focus on what we as a council have a duty to deliver, and reduce the work we do that’s additional to that.#We have to consider, unfortunately, even those services that are valued,they are not a statutory requirement.#Our priority will be as always to make the best possible use of whatever level of funding we receive, We must set our budget in February .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing. Why have showering, changing, and laundering facilities not been provided in the interim ”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCrosshouse HospitalAyrKilmarnockAutismDrugsNHS ScotlandEast Ayrshire CouncilPolice ScotlandIndy ref Health and pensionsScottish Government"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girvan town set revamp new","story":"NewsGirvan town set for revamp with new CCTV to be installedIn recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month.ShareByPippa Smith:,  DEC NewsCllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the community \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGirvan’s thoroughfare is set to get a revamp of new CCTV cameras.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"enduring-ties-from-lockerbie-bombing-leave-legacy-of-hope","story":"The enduring ties and friendships created following the Lockerbie bombing have left a legacy of hope for the future, Nicola Sturgeon has said.The First Minister was speaking in the Scottish Parliament ahead of the th anniversary of the tragedy on December , , in which  people from  nations died.The Solicitor General for Scotland, Alison Di Rollo, will attend events in the United States on Friday, whilst Lord Advocate James Wolffe will represent the Scottish Government at a memorial service in Lockerbie.Speaking at Holyrood on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said MSPs will reflect on all those who lost loved ones in the incident, as well as the residents of Lockerbie.ldquoAn almost unimaginable tragedy brought out incredible reserves of solidarity, compassion and love, she said.ldquoThe bereaved showed immense dignity and resilience.

Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together.

It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9193528.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gloom-for-200000-from-eu-who-came-to-live-in-scotland","story":"Many have built their entire lives herein Scotland, with friends, family, and a career.

After her deal is defeated in mid-January, she will delay and preicate, let the days and hours tick by until a hard Brexit becomes an imminent reality. She will then force Parliament to accept her deal to avoid no deal. From her point of view it makes sense. The reality is that Labour risks colluding with this irresponsible brinksmanship. It has been playing around with presentational ersions to avoid having to make any strategic decision about unblocking Brexit.The Prime Minister batted away Jeremy Corbynrsquos contrived attempt to move a confidence motion in her personally, but not her Government ndash a ldquomotion of no consequence as itrsquos been called. A properly tabled confidence motion, which Labour knows is the only one that would have been put to a vote, would likely have been defeated as Tory MPs united around their beleaguered leader.

The discredited former PM is the only politician who seems to be offering anything remotely resembling leadership right now. He has been perambulating around Europe, much to Mrs Mayrsquos displeasure, urging EU leaders to take seriously the possibility of the repeat referendum he advocates. He brushes aside the argument that this would be a betrayal of democracy. Nonsense, he says: a referendum IS democracy ndash the only democratic solution when Parliament is deadlocked.:SNP and Lib Dems put down no-confidence motion in Theresa Mays GovernmentIn one sense Labour is more united than ever. Both the youth wing, and the activists of Momentum, are ardent Remainers and desperate for another referendum. In this they are joined by the old Blairite Labour Right, led by former shadow cabinet luminaries like Chukka Umunna and Hilary Benn. But the old Labour Left, who by an accident of history happen to occupy the Labour leadership right now, are Eurosceptics in the proper sense of the word. Mr Corbyn says he voted Remain in , but Labourrsquos  manesto made a clear promise to deliver Brexit and end free movement.Labour only really opposes Mrs Mayrsquos version of Brexit because it doesnrsquot protect workplace rights and doesnrsquot guarantee friction-free trade. Mr Corbyn says he wants a General Election so that he can go off and negotiate a version of the Withdrawal Agreement that doesnrsquot have these limitations. But everyone knows this is pure fantasy ndash an insult to the intelligence of the voters. Eventhere were time for a General Election and a renegotiation before March, it would be futile. The Withdrawal Agreement is a legally drafted document, negotiated over two and half long years, and has been endorsed by all  remaining states. Unless the UK is prepared to lt its red lines and stay in the single market with Norway, which Labour isnrsquot prepared to do, then there is nothing more to be said. The Irish backstop would remain because Labour is committed to avoiding a border.The logic of Labourrsquos position should surely be to wrest what concessions it can from Mrs May about workplace protections and the Good Friday Agreement and then back her amended deal. The Withdrawal Agreement is not, after all, the future trade agreement with the European Union. It only sorts the immediate problems of paying the orce bill and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens, here and in Ireland. The Political Declaration on the future relations with the EU that accompanied the Withdrawal Agreement is much more contentious. Itrsquos a vague wish list in which the only definitive red line is on free movement, insisted upon by Mrs May. Labour should surely be using its influence now to ensure that the future trade deal keeps Britain in that ldquopermanent customs union and single market alignment that Mr Corbyn always talks about.Now, many Scots will be appalled at this suggestion that Labour should back Mrs May, and I hasten to add that it is not my own position. I would never have left the European Union in the first place. Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and has been treated abominably in the Brexit process. Scotlandrsquos legitimate interests in securing a Brexit that doesnrsquot damage Scottish economic and civic le have been peremptorily dismissed by Westminster. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos proposals for Scotland to have similar regulatory alignment with the EU, as accepted for Northern Ireland, were batted away without a thought.The UK Governmentrsquos subsequent legal jiggery-pokery has damaged the constitutional standing of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, under which the Scottish Parliament had to consent to Westminster legislation that cuts across its devolved powers, has been exposed as a sham. No backstop there. The Scottish Parliamentrsquos Continuity Bill, which sought to ensure that Holyrood retained its devolved powers as they were repatriated from Brussels, was disposed of by retrospective legislation which would have shamed a banana republic. Scotlandrsquos requests for devolution of responsibilities like immigration have also been ignored.But the unfortunate reality is that Scotland is irrelevant right now. The Westminster parties are entirely preoccupied with their own Brexit psychodrama.

The risk is this makes small business owners into de-facto immigration officers, said Mr McRae.He added: \"The proposed system also puts a lot of faith on Whitehall officials to predict the skills needs of a Dundonian manufacturer or a Highland hotelier years in advance. This reliance on state central planning is not the hallmark of a dynamic, responsive trading environment.\"Willie Rennie for the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the Governmentrsquos immigration plans would ldquobring chaos, not control, noting how ldquoScotland depends on immigration, from our farms to our NHS\".Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative backbencher Kirstene Hair also expressed concerns about the pound, salary threshold and low-skilled sectors.\"Many healthcare, hospitality, agricultural and fisheries jobs do not meet the salary floor or skill level in the proposals outlined, which could prevent these vital workers coming to the UK to work and contribute to our economy.The Angus MP said that she would be calling for ldquoexemptions where there were shortages in those important sectors to ensure ldquoour future immigration policy addresses specic economic and demographic needs in Scotland and across the UK\"."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-continues-to-seek-further-assurances-from-eu-on-backstop-but-nicola-sturgeon-says-efforts-nebulous","story":"As opposition parties continued to complain that the Prime Minister had put off the meaningful vote on her Brexit Plan to the week beginning January  ndash just days before the January  deadline in the Withdrawal Agreement ndash she told reporters on a visit to Heathrow Airport: \"Were talking to the EU about some further assurances to assuage the concerns that MPs had on a particular issue in the Withdrawal Agreement and were working on that and Parliament will have a vote in January.\"I want to see us leaving the European Union with a good deal but until were sure that thats been ratied, it makes sense, its reasonable for Government to make contingency arrangements for a no deal and thats exactly what were doing.\"In PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn tore into the PMrsquos strategy, using a string of heated putdowns. Accusing her of wasting pound billion on no-deal contingency planning, he said: ldquoWhat the Prime Minister is doing is a criminal waste of money.ldquoShe is recklessly running down the clock, all in a shameful attempt to make her own bad deal look like the lesser of two evils.The Labour leader added: ldquoWith rising crime, , fewer police on our streets, , vacancies in our national health service, and the worst performance last month of any November on record, how can the Prime Minister justy wasting that money on no deal, which cannot and will not happen Mrs May replied by insisting that until a deal was ratied, the responsible position of any government was to put in place contingency arrangements for a no-deal.ldquoBut I repeat thathe wants to ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal, he has to put into practice what he is saying and actually vote for a deal, she declared.Later, the PM chaired a plenary session of the inter-governmental Joint Ministerial Committee, urging the devolved administrations to ldquopull together behind her Brexit Plan.The First Minister, who attended, insisted the ldquourgent priority now is to secure support for an option other than the PMrsquos proposal or a no-deal outcome, which is why an Article  extension has become essential.Afterwards she told reporters: \"Its beyond me that any prime minister would want to have as her legacy turning the UK inwards and making it less open and welcoming to people from the rest of the world.\"Askedthe PM had spelt out what was being done to progress getting a deal acceptable to Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: \"It was a wee bit nebulous.

Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Thursday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting.

Most cash was paid to Scottish wind farms, with some earning more than £m a month for not supplying power.Whitelee and its extension on the outskirts of Glasgow, the biggest onshore wind farm in the UK, has received almost a fth of the entire pot since , with payments totalling more than £m to date.Meanwhile, the MW Clyde scheme, near Abington in South Lanarkshire, has raked in more than £m and the Grfin, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire, nearly £m. The amount paid out has been rising annually, despite a new transmission cable to export power from Scotland south of the Border.The fees, known as constraint payments, are paid for by households across the UK.Anti-wind campaigners say spending on constraints has got “completely out of control”, and described expansion of the industry as “reckless”.Lyndsey Ward, who lives in the Highlands, said: “The constraints situation is completely out of control. The Scottish Government is recklessly approving more and more turbines to be connected to a grid that has little hope of managing any power they produce. “The result is an ever-increasing number of turbines have to be switched off and it is the consumer who pays. “Industry also has the wind costs on their energy bills and they add that on to the goods and services they sell us.” The £. billion Western Link interconnector, which became operational last year, runs  miles underwater from Hunterston in Ayrshire to Connah’s Quay in North Wales.It was hoped by exporting power to England and Wales the cable would cut levels of compensation paid to energy firms when Scottish turbines have to be shut down because supply outstrips demand.But faults have seen the cable – a joint project between network operators National Grid and Scottish Power Transmission – unable to operate at full capacity until last month.So far there seems no reduction in payouts compared to the same time last year.Dr John Constable is director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity which first exposed constraint payments to wind generators and publishes data on the costs.He said: “No-one expected the Western Link to be a complete solution to wind power constraint costs, but the continuing level of payments is strikingly high – £m in November, £.m in December so far – raising the question as to whether this very expensive interconnector represents value for money.”Energy regulator Ofgem approved the Western Link project following a cost-benefit analysis that showed it would reduce consumer bills.A spokeswoman for National Grid said: “The Western Link project is playing a vital role in reinforcing the existing UK transmission system … The project is in the early days of operation but will signicantly reduce the levels of constraint payments being made to wind generators.” A spokesman for Ofgem added: “Ofgem sets National Grid, as electricity system operator, strong financial incentives to manage constraint costs efficiently. Overall these costs are less than  per cent of a typical household electricity bill.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847028.1545318521!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon responds to labour criticism of snp education record","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has defended her Government#s record on education, saying there are now as many primary school teachers as there were when she was a child.During First Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Richard Leonard cited the comments of two teachers, who are purportedly SNP members, describing “a crisis where schools are understaffed”.Mr Leonard said a teacher in North Lanarkshire called Esther wrote in the Scottish Educational Journal: “Despite what you have said yourself on many occasions, it is becoming clear that education is not a priority for this Government.”: Ruth Davidson: SNP are ‘rigging education stats’There are , fewer teachers than when the SNP came to power, Mr Leonard said.The First Minister responded: “We saw just last week a rise of almost  in the number of teachers in our schools, that follows a rise in the year before and the year before that as well.”“The number of primary school teachers is at the highest level since I was at primary school in ,” added Ms Sturgeon.Mr Leonard said: “There are , fewer teachers in our classrooms, no progress has been made in closing the attainment gap, and Scotland is facing its first teachers strike since Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.: Brian Monteith: ‘Education failure’ will be the Nationalist epitaph“Nicola Sturgeon told us that education is her top priority, but parents don’t believe that, teachers don’t believe that, and now even her own party members don’t believe that either.”Scottish Government statistics last week indicated schools employed the full-time equivalentof , teachers.The total of , FTE primary teachers is the highest since , the Government said.Overall teacher numbers, including those working in early learning and childcare centres, are the highest they have been since  at ,.As a result, the teacher workforce in  is  higher than it was the previous year.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845340.1545122767!/image/image.jpg","title":"a brexit carol theresa may haunted by three ghosts paris gourtsoyannis","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...As she tries to save her Brexit deal, what would happenTheresa May got a ghostly visit or three this Christmas, wonders Paris Gourtsoyannis.Theresa May’s Brexit deal was dead. Dead as a doornail.Yet of all the good days in the year, on Christmas eve the Prime Minister still sat in her Downing Street office, the door open that she might keep an eye on her clerks.Gavin Barwell and Robbie Gibb sat in the light of a very small fire, barely visible in the shadows cast by piles of draft Withdrawal Agreements, assurances and side-letters, backstops to the backstop, and flowcharts pointing at dferent fates for May.Hands freezing, backs bent, they scratched out desperate plans to force her deal through the Commons. Scurrying over the floorboards in the dark, damp corners, whips searched for votes.May’s phone vibrated and cast a shaft of light into the darkness – a text. “You don’t have to do this, Theresa. I’m just trying to help. Merry Christmas, TB.”“Nothing has changed!” she wheezed, firing back: “Keep Brexit in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”Leaving her clerks to their work, May climbed the stairs to her apartment to take her melancholy dinner and try and unwind in front of a relaxing episode of ‘Naval Crime Investigation Service ’.No sooner had she nodded off than May was awoken by a clanking, thudding sound on the stairs, growing closer, and louder, relentless and doom-laden, like thecomment section.Through her closed bedroom door a figure appeared, and the blue TV light crackled and leapt as though it cried: “I know him Nick Timothy’s ghost!”The same beardy face, the same name. The chain her former special adviser drew was clasped about his middle and dragged bundles of newspapers.“But Nick,” May whimpered, cowering, “you’re in chains.”“It is required of every man,” Timothy replied, “thatthey are not self-aware in le, then it is condemned to be after death.”The spectre raised a cry and shook its columns. “I wear the chain I made in Downing Street,” it said “I made it line by line, blame by shted blame.“I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate,” Timothy went on. “You will be haunted by Three Spirits.”May awoke with a start, but before she could convince herself it was a dream, light flashed and the curtains of her bed were drawn. She found herself before a strange figure, with a face like child, yet not so like a child as like an old man.“David,” she said, recognising her predecessor. “Are you a spirit, too ”“I am the Ghost of Brexit Past,” David Cameron intoned. “Yours, thankfully, not mine.”She took him by the hand and the pair flew into the past, alighting first at a  meeting with Goldman Sachs bankers, where she warned Brexit would deter investment in the UK, then to a speech where she warned of the risks to EU-wide security cooperation.: Jeremy Corbyn to table no confidence motion in PMBrexit vote date not setOn to her first Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, where she said “Citizens of the World” were really “Citizens of Nowhere”, and then back to Downing Street. “Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek ” For this was where May called an election accusing the EU of undermining Brexit, then lost her majority.May awoke for a second time, and found her bedroom filled from top to bottom with angry men in suits, discussing in the most extravagant and overflowing terms exactly how they were going to dispose of her. “Come in!” exclaimed the weird and not-at-all-jolly giant presiding over the European Research Group. “I am the Ghost of Brexit Present, and we’re going to feed you into a wood chipper.”Issuing bloody threats all the while, the spirit showed May ordinary families ruining their Christmas dinners with arguments about Europe, plotting MPs, fruit crops rotting in polytunnels, and more angry figures in yellow vests shouting about betrayal.“All this is possible thanks to you isn’t it great ” the Ghost said. “Can’t wait to boil you in a pot.”And suddenly, he was gone. Lting up her eyes, May beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming towards her like a mist along the ground that has somehow managed not to be sacked. “Jeremy ” she asked. “But you’re a Remainer!” Jeremy Hunt answered not, but gave a hooded, sepulchral shrug.“Ghost of Brexit that is Yet to Come!” May exclaimed. “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.” And truly, the sights of no-deal Brexit Britain chilled May to the bone.She was transported back to her Commons office, but behind her desk Prime Minister Tom Tugendhat had his head in his hands. His government of national unity, formed in the wake of splits in the two main parties, was collapsing. Amid a stack of resignation letters were demands from Nicola Sturgeon for a Section  order, and calls from Sinn Fein for a border poll in Northern Ireland.In the streets, protesters gathered round skips filled with burning copies of David Cameron’s memoirs for warmth. There were no negotiations with the EU Brussels was in chaos since the far right surged in European elections. Nor was President Pence in a position to offer a trade deal, what with the legal trouble.The spectre took May to conflicts in Ukraine and Yemen, where the UK had given up any pretence of exerting its influence. And they visited China, which continued to suck up production and jobs as the West dismantled the world trade system it had designed. Actually, they went to Japan first before Hunt worked out his mistake.“Good spirit,” May cried when she had seen these things “Assure me that I may yet change these shadows. I will live in the past, present and future. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach!”She awoke with a start again, and knew things were dferent. Flinging open the window of Number , she made a series of unnatural jerking movements, like a jostled shop mannequin about to topple over.“But darling,” cried her husband Philip, “you’re dancing with joy! And only last night you were so despondent.”Beaming, she turned to him. “I know what I have to do.”: Brexit: There’s only one way out of this screw-up – Christine Jardine©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845913.1545206611!/image/image.jpg","title":"how home office is blocking glasgow s efforts to provide true asylum martyn mclaughlin","story":"The Home Office#s intransigent approach to providing housing for asylum seekers is causing anger and mistrust across the country, writes Martyn McLaughlin.Anyone who has paid attention to the Home Office’s thoughtless and negligent approach to housing asylum seekers over the past decade will not be unduly surprised by the latest damning report from the Home Affairs Select Committee.The most obvious question to draw from its primary conclusion – that local authorities across the UK are experiencing a crisis of trust in a broken system – is quite simple. What took so long Britain’s dispersal policy has been unfit for purpose for years. The Home Office’s existing ‘Compass’ contract places the responsibility for housing some of society’s most vulnerable iniduals with multinational conglomerates, some of whom had no prior experience in the complex asylum housing sector. In Glasgow, where Serco has been widely criticised, there have been numerous examples of the initiative’s folly: families forced to reside in properties ridden with vermin and damp, or which lacked essentials such as window panes and heating. Serco’s plan the change the locks on the properties of asylum seekers earlier this summer sparked widespread protests and a legal challenge. Charities and NGOs forced to pick up the pieces have been some of the fiercest critics of Compass, but the new report, published on Monday, shows that councils are fast catching up. With confidence in the entire process waning, MPs have warned that the entire system could soon become untenable.“Nearly two years after our previous report, very little has improved and mistrust by local authorities of central Government has deepened,” the committee noted. “The Government’s handling of the replacement for Compass has led dispersal authorities to consider withdrawal from participation in the dispersal scheme.”In truth, the use of the word replacement is a tad disingenuous renewal would a far more fitting descriptor, given the UK Government looks set to plough ahead with issuing decade-long Asylum Accommodation and Support Servicescontracts. The acronym may be new, but it is Compass in all but name.: Insight: Asylum seekers at breaking point as trauma takes its toll on mental healthThe dissatisfaction over the dispersal scheme is most keenly felt in Yorkshire, but it is proving contagious. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, recently wrote to Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, detailing his misgivings regarding oversight of the dispersal contract, and underlining the need for a fairer distribution of asylum arrivals across the country. Emphasising the gravity of the problems, Mr Burnham warned him that Manchester’s ten local authorities were now “seriously considering” their continued participation in the scheme. Fortunately, especially for the ,-plus asylum seekers in Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow City Council is not inclined to follow suit. It was one of the first cities in the UK after London to join the dispersal scheme and for nearly  years, it has taken great pride in its participation.The city, in turn, has benefited immeasurably. In the space of a generation, its communities and culture have been enriched and Glasgow’s reputation as a welcoming city has been enhanced. The SNP administration knows this only too well, and it is keen to continue with the dispersal programme,not the precise arrangements put in place by the Home Office. When Glasgow first became part of the initiative, it was the city council itself which was the contract holder. All these years later, and in light of the disastrous Compass contract, the council was minded to take over the reins for AASC. : Brian Wilson: Serco right about one thing in asylum seeker eviction rowAfter making a formal expression of interest, it received a -page form from the Home Office, designed for organisations with direct experience of providing asylum accommodation in the past ten years. It was, said Susan Aitken, the council leader, “almost impossible for us to answer”.Undeterred, she is among other local authority heads pressing for greater oversight of the new AASC arrangements, albeit to little avail. The Home Office has repeatedly warned that ceding control of property inspections to local authorities, for example, would compromise its ability to hold accommodation providers to account. It is a claim as laughable as it is absurd. Such is the Home Office’s commitment to ensuring that asylum housing is fit for purpose, it employs the grand total of nine contract compliance officers, responsible for assessing , dispersal accommodationproperties across the UK. A single officer is based in Glasgow.The workload they are able to carry out has produced some damning conclusions. Between March  and January this year, for example, less than a quarter of those properties inspected were found to be compliant with the requirements of the Compass contract. Close to halfwere deemed not fit for purpose. A separate inspection report carried out earlier this year by David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that the Home Office inspection regime was essentially a system of spot checks, which were neither informed by intelligence, nor subject to follow-up inspections. The Home Office has shown itself to be unable,not unwilling, to ensure some of Scotland’s most marginalised and vulnerable people are given proper shelter. If it is allowed to steamroll through its plans for AASC with no meaningful changes, we will all be the poorer for it.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845818.1545206166!/image/image.jpg","title":"why birmingham may be a role model for scottish cities chris mccall","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...After three months in Birmingham, Chris McCall says the rebirth of UK#s second largest conurbation could have lessons for Scotland#s cities.Their faces said it all. It was a look of slight surprise crossed with mild concern. I had told them I was moving to Birmingham. Whether it was friends, family or colleagues, they struggled to see the appeal of le in the UK’s second largest city.I would explain I was moving for a three-month work secondment. It was too good an opportunity to turn down. I planned to travel home to Glasgow most weekends. Exploring a new city would be fun.“The only thing I know about Birmingham is there are a lot of motorways,” was a typical response. It had that in common with my home town, I thought. Here was another place that had been determined to bulldoze its way to post-war prosperity. Unlike Scotland’s biggest city, Brum held its nerve and built not one but two ring roads – instead of the half-finished mess inflicted on Charing Cross and Tradeston.But what did I really know about this sprawling metropolis  That the car was king, of course. Millions of them were built there and thousands of properties had been cleared to make way for the roads its new car-owning society demanded. Birmingham was the UK’s Motown – but with a much heavier musical legacy Black Sabbath never wrote cutesy soul songs.“Birmingham’s name is known everywhere,” the broadcaster Jonathan Meades observed two decades ago. “But its people aren’t, and nor is their city which is in the middle of England and is Middle England. It’s hyperbolically typical of England, yet at the same time it’s hermetic – it’s an ignored voice in the heart of the country.”It’s fair to say that downtown Brum is still largely dominated by its roads. Yet it’s gradually moving away from the cult of the automobile towards a more sustainable future which could offer examples for Scotland’s major cities.When I stepped off the train at New Street in September, I was determined I would understand Birmingham by the time I left. I might not grow to love it, I thought, but I would at the very least appreciate what it had to offer.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesStations can tell us a lot about a place, and the story of New Street tells us more than most. It was once a grand Victorian affair with an Italianate style hotel and a spectacular  canopy designed by Edward Alfred Cowper. It was a terminus that reflected the commercial might of the Midlands.That fine station roof was one of many Brum landmarks to be damaged beyond repair by the Luftwaffe, while the hotel fell victim to British Rail’s west coast mainline modernisation programme of the early s – the same damned project that blighted London’s Euston station. The new New Street was generally despised from the off. Instead of providing a beacon of the future, it condemned passengers to a hideous concrete bunker. A costly refurbishment programme began in . While the s remain subterranean – meaning diesel fumes still linger – the upstairs is now a bold and bright concourse.There’s plenty of space for strangers to find their bearings. “If you think it’s bad now, you should have seen it before,” Brummies say, with characteristic self-deprecation. “Brum will be great when it’s finally finished,” is another line you hear regularly. This is a city with a long record of tearing itself down and trying something dferent.The New Street rebuild is just one of several ambitious local projects. The redeveloped Bullring shopping centre boasts a Selfridges, the high-end department store long coveted by Glasgow. The city’s modern tram network is currently being extended with little of the fuss seen in Edinburgh.: Kevin Buckle: Edinburgh’s lost railway could be restoredHere I was, privileged to be witnessing the rebirth of one of the UK’s major cities in real time. Unlike in Dundee, which has chosen to take the Bilbao route of hanging its international appeal on an eye-catching museum, Birmingham has opted to get the basics right. If you can offer numerous decent shops and a gleaming station, visitors will soon follow.For a city with a long association with the car, it’s investing substantial amounts in public transport. Its suburban rail network has been continuously growing for years. Then there’s the small matter of HS, the eye-wateringly expensive infrastructure project – or colossal folly, depending on your viewpoint – which will link Birmingham with London via a new high-speed rail line.In comparison, it strikes me that Scotland’s two biggest cities seem incapable of sorting out public transport in their own backyards. Edinburgh’s buses are the best outside of London but the capital seems uninterested in reopening its extensive network of suburban railways to passengers. The less said about the tram system, the better.Glasgow, meanwhile, boasts dozens of stations yet is stuck with a bus network that’s grimly tolerated at best. Its own plans for a tram system bit the dust  years ago and have never seriously been reconsidered.Brummies would be the first to tell you their city isn’t perfect. Among other things, it lacks any instantly recognisble landmarks to entice visitors. The council hopes its flash public library, opened in , is becoming one. The -storey building positively screams modern civic ambition.I looked beyond these modern developments whenever I felt the dull ache of home sickness. I was fortunate to stay a short distance from the Birmingham and Worcester canal, one of two major waterways built in the Georgian era. If you enjoy a stroll along a quiet towpath, Birmingham is your place. It’s one of the few parts of the city you’re guaranteed not see any cars.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4846893.1545309607!/image/image.jpg","title":"broadcaster behind alex salmond show faces ofcom sanction","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Alex Salmond#s chat show faces an uncertain future after its host broadcaster was censured by Ofcom for breaching impartiality rules.The regulator said that it was minded to consider imposing a ‘statutory sanction’ on RT, formerly known as Russia Today, after finding it guilty of seven breaches of the broadcasting code over coverage of the Skripal poisoning case in Salisbury.

Ofcom previously censured RT after an edition of the Alex Salmond Show breached rules for claiming messages to the show had come from viewers when in fact they were sent by production staff. Seven programmes in Russia Todaywere found to have breached rules on impartiality for the way they covered the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter.

RT is not a British broadcaster. Viewers turn to RT with the expectation that they will receive a Russian viewpoint.”Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: “RT’s mask as an impartial news provider is clearly slipping. We know some foreign regimes will use any vehicle at their disposal to sow discord in the West. “It is vital that as a society we remain vigilant to the spread of harmful disinformation and Ofcom has strong powers to tackle it where it occurs in broadcast news.”A Russia Today spokesperson said: “RT is extremely disappointed by Ofcom’s conclusions in what were almost all self-initiated investigations into RT by the regulator. We operate under rules outlined by the regulator, and always strive to abide by them. “It appears Ofcom has failed to fully take on-board what we said in response to its investigations and, in particular, has not paid due regard to the rights of a broadcaster and the audience.

The White Paper itself suggests that it may result in an % reduction in the number of EEA workers to Scotland - this will be catastrophic for communities and businesses across the whole of Scotland, particularly for key sectors such as tourism, hospitality and the care sector.\"Our modelling estimates that real GDP in Scotland will be around .% lower by  than it would have been otherwise, as a result of Brexit-driven reduction in migration.“This is equivalent to a fall of almost £. billion a year in GDP by  and a fall of £ billion in Government revenue over the period. This is an unacceptable price for Scotland to pay.”Tracy Black, the director of CBI Scotland, called the policy a “sucker punch” to employers.“A new immigration system must command public confidence and support the economies of all parts of the UK,” Ms Black said. “These proposals would achieve neither.“The proposals outlined in the White Paper don’t meet Scotland’s needs or the needs of the UK as a whole, and would be a sucker punch for many firms right across the country.“The UK Government’s own analysis suggests people and regions will be poorer as a result of them.”The proposals also drew criticism from Kirstene Hair, the Scottish Conservative MP for Angus. “The detailed White Paper outlines a skilled based system that will enable nationalities around the world to come and work in the UK,\" Ms Hair said.\"But I do have concerns regarding the £, salary threshold and low skilled sectors.“Many healthcare, hospitality, agricultural and fisheries jobs do not meet the salary floor or skill level in the proposals outlined which could prevent these vital workers coming to the UK to work and contribute to our economy.\"Scottish Secretary David Mundell defended the new measures, saying they provide \"a strong foundation for delivering what businesses and iniduals in Scotland want – a UK-wide immigration system with the flexibility to meet the needs of all sectors of the economy in all parts of the country.\"Mr Mundell added: \"Our  month engagement with business will allow us to develop a future immigration system which addresses the specic economic and demographic needs in Scotland.\"At the same time, the Scottish Government must do more to shoulder their share of the responsibility for making Scotland an attractive place for people to live, work and put down roots.”A new work visa scheme will allow immigrants to come to the UK to work for up to a year.The new measure, which would be in place until at least , is designed to act as a \"safety valve\" for the economy and protect sectors reliant on lower skilled overseas labour.It would be open to nationals from specied countries, regardless of their skill level or whether they have a definite job offer.Applicants would need to apply for a visa which would be limited to  months, at which point a \"cooling-off\" period will take effect, meaning they could notunder the same route for the next year.While in the UK, they would not be entitled to access public funds or switch to other routes, bring dependant family members or seek permanent settlement.The White Paper states: \"We have listened to the concerns of businesses ... and so there will be a route allowing temporary short-term workers to come for a year.\": EU migration falls to lowest level since The scheme would be open to all skill levels, with no sponsorship requirement.It would be subject to \"tightly defined\" conditions and only open to migrants from \"specied low-risk countries\".Numbers admitted through the route may also be restricted, while the Government stressed it was a \"transitory\" measure and would be subject to a full review by .The new skilled work route would be opened up to workers with \"intermediate\" level skills.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights.

I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium.

His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

I am absolutely delighted as I feel strongly about honouring Ruby’s name and keeping her memory alive.I also took part in the NI Childrens Hospice K Jingle all the way run on Sunday, December , so with the party and the run, I have raised a total of pound,.Lisa has also launched a blogging website called Chasing Ladybirds. The blog is now live and can be assessed by logging on to www.chasingladybirds.The blog provides Lisa with an outlet to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa explained: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christmas in comfort at clonard","story":"CLONARD parishioners will be able to enjoy their Christmas Mass even more this year as the traditional hard wooden pews have been consigned to the past. In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses.

And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chris moncrieff whether youre a leaver or a remainer a second poll would be a betrayal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is true whether you are a Remainer or a Leaver. Parliament ordained the referendum and, at the same time, gave a solemn promise that they’d abide by the result..pushThe fact politicians have got themselves in such a mess trying to implement the referendum result in favour of quitting the EU cannot ever be used as an excuse for defaulting on the original undertaking.To her eternal credit, the Prime Minister refuses to bow to the clamour for a second referendum.She hit out at Tony Blair, accusing him of “insulting” the British people and the office of Prime Minister by “undermining” Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.In a pointed swipe at the Labour heavyweight, the Prime Minister said a second referendum would amount to parliament abdicating responsibility.Mrs May said: “For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision.“Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for. I remain determined to see that happen. I will not let the British people down.”The trouble is that the people who really matter — the great British electorate — are being fobbed off with contradictory stories about what is going on behind the scenes. Some are insisting that the Cabinet is involved in its own civil war about whether to have a second referendum, while others insist this is completely untrue.Meanwhile, those calling for another poll are claiming that those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did not appreciate what this would involve.How patronising. Of course, most people realised that the EU negotiating team would try to squeeze every drop of blood out of the UK in what has approached the level of bullying the Prime Minister partly, no doubt, to frighten any other member states which might be considering following in the UK’s footsteps.It’s asthe elitists simply assume — arrogantly — that they know better than the people they are supposed to serve .Some of the reasons given by those demanding another referendum are bizarre — to put it mildly. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said the Remain campaign during the original referendum fell far short of even being effective.Well, that is laughable and is no reason for going to the polls again.The simple truth is that the British voters, on both sides of the argument, deserve better of their politicians than this.n Theresa May is fighting her corner against a stubborn and obdurate team of negotiators in Brussels, who are finding her a much tougher opponent than they’d probably expected.But there are those who would like to see a little more drama and aggression on the part of the UK team.In similar circumstances, Margaret Thatcherwould thump the table and brandish her famous handbag, frightening the lives out of the Brussels team.Theresa May cannot match that — but she is adamant not to surrender and is to be commended for that.But what is urgently required is some kind of magic to sort out the shambles in the House of Commons, where at the moment getting a majority on anything appears to be a major problem.Somehow, all this has to be resolved and the Leavers get what they voted for in the referendum in a fair and honourable way. n When all this is over, major surgery will be required to restore the shattered Conservative Party back to rude health. It may well take a new leader to do that.As you might expect, the usual suspects, like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , have both indicated they will be in the running.But in politics, it is often not the obvious names who get the crown.Has anyone thought of David Lidington — the quiet man who is Theresa May’s de facto number two  He is the dark horse to watch.But there is going to be a lot more discord before that position is reached."},{"url":null,"title":"dups emma pengelly reminds academic she has arts degree from ulster university","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish government has made no preparations for hard border says varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side.

will then be published early in the New Year with a further  days then set aside for public comment before a final scheme is published.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews, who appealed to voters in Crossgar concerned about not being able to vote in their home village to respond to the consultation, hopes ldquocommon sense will prevail.He and a number of his Rowallane colleagues remain concerned that people who live within touching distance of the designated polling station at Glasswater Primary School, will have to make their way either to a church hall in Drumaghlis or Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The local politicians say it is somewhat ironic that people who live on the periphery of Crossgar will be able to vote in the village, but those who live in the heart of the village will not.They believe the Electoral Officersquos draft proposal is ldquoflawed and have warned it will particularly impact on the elderly and those who have no access to public transport.Cllr Andrews said the draft proposal will have a ldquodetrimental effect on the people of Crossgar and district.ldquoResidents in the centre of the village will have to bypass Glasswater Primary School polling station and travel three miles to vote in Drumaghlis or five miles the other way to Killyleagh, he continued.ldquoIn my opinion, this draft proposal is senseless, flawed and discriminatory and treats Crossgar residents like second class citizens. What do people who have no access to transport do when it comes to casting their vote Cllr Andrews said that with an estimated population of , people, voters in Crossgar were being treated dferently to those in Killyleagh, Saintfield and Ballynahinch.ldquoI hope this proposal will be revisited so people in Crossgar and the surrounding district can enjoy the right of exercising their democratic right to vote in their own village, something many others take for granted where in the district, he declared.ldquoThe bottom line is thatyou live in Crossgar and intend to vote in next yearrsquos council elections you will have to travel either three miles to Drumaghlis or five miles to Killyleagh which simply isnrsquot on.He added: ldquoI sincerely hope common sense prevails and that this ridiculous draft proposal will be consigned to the bin where it belongs.ldquoWhat is really ironic is that while people in Crossgar must travel outside the village to vote, those in areas including Annacloy and Bells Hill will be heading into Crossgar to cast their vote.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

People in Lockerbie and the surrounding area opened their hearts to those who had lost loved ones.ldquoEnduring ties and friendships have been created. Syracuse University, which lost  of its students in the bombing, now accepts two scholarship pupils every year from Lockerbie Academy.ldquoThat is a powerful example of the way in which people have worked to remember the past, in a way which also builds hope for the future.ldquoThat hope is also now part of the legacy of Lockerbie. And that is perhaps something to hold in our hearts tomorrow as we look back on the tragedy, as we think about all those who lost loved ones and as we remember and honour all those who died.Seats among the wreckage from Pan Am flight  in Lockerbie after the plane was blown apart by a bomb Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw paid tribute to one of the victims, who had worked in his familyrsquos business and died at Lockerbie.ldquoI associate myself entirely with the remarks the First Minister has made and the remarks that the Prime Minister made yesterday, said Mr Carlaw.ldquoAs I was preparing for Christmas that year, so were the Somerville family. Jack Somerville had been the retail vehicle sales manager in our family business for some  years before he retired.ldquoI remember him with great affection ndash yes, he had a sheepskin coat like all the best used car sales managers. He was fond of a cigar, he was a big personality.ldquoHe and his family were in the house in which the plane landed and were obliterated.ldquoI know I, and many of his former colleagues, along with all those who lost relatives and friends think fondly of them each year when this anniversary comes around.Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was jailed for  years in  over the bombing.But he was freed from Greenock prison in  on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, and he died three years later in Libya.The decision was controversial but Megrahi was only expected to live for around three months after being released.Then US president Barack Obama branded the decision to release him ldquoa mistake and some US victimsrsquo families reacted angrily.Writing in The Scotsman on Thursday, then Scottish justice secretary Kenny MacAskill maintained that freeing Megrahi was ldquothe right thing to do.He said: ldquoItrsquos a decision I stand by to this day and whilst some disagree, with it few can fault the procedure.ldquoIndeed, information that has come to light since has simply confirmed my view.ldquoQuestions remain over the conviction of Megrahi but whilst Irsquove never believed him to be the bomber, he most certainly was no innocent abroad.ldquoHe was the highest-ranking official Libya would release and the lowest one the West would accept.ldquoBut the UK and USA know the full story, evena court never will, having their spies and even getting their sources out.ldquoSadly, thatrsquos why the conspiracy theories will run forever, with me now part of them..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Enduring ties from Lockerbie bombing  uleave legacy of hope u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Parents in Moira, Maralin and other outlying areas would rightly be thinking whether a bus to Lurgan, then another bus to Portadown in the morning, then reverse the process in the afternoon - earlier starting and later finishing – would be conducive to their children’s well-being or learning.“The best way to meet their needs is that they remain on the Toberhewny site where teachers who know them, really know them, can offer them a first-class education.“Educators will tell you that transition at any age can bring regression for many children so why in Lurgan are we willing to let this happen “Previous Craigavon Senior High School principals often said it took at least a full term for pupils to settle down to learn. We are always teaching for readiness and when relationships are formed, the learning can begin.” They said staff at Lurgan Junior High School ‘would willingly embrace these young people and provide for them the best educational outcomes possible with a curriculum suited to their needs’.Their letter added: “The ideal solution would be for the pupils to remain on the Toberhewny site at a new - school, which would accommodate not only our - children but also those who would have gone on to Craigavon Senior High School .

Our pupils deserve to be treated equally.“Lurgan Junior High School is almost  years old so now is the time to be bullish and push for a modern, state of the art solution for all children in our catchment area.” In an appeal to parents they said: “Make every effort to attend the consultation meeting, Ask questions at the meeting, Speak up for your children – all are important whether Grammar or High School pupils.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cd_1.jpg","title":"it and the city deal","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew looks at what major IT elements Belfast and the surrounding regions could get out of a potential £bn City Deal When it was formally announced that the Government would put forward £m from the Treasury towards a finance pot worth up to £bn for six councils as part of a new City Deal, it’s obvious that IT, innovation and manufacturing technologies would be high on the list. The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
